Abstract
The identification of CD4+ T cell epitopes is essential for the design of effective vaccines capable
of inducing neutralizing antibodies and long-term immunity. Here we demonstrate in COVID-19
patients a robust CD4+ T cell response to naturally processed SARS-CoV-2 Spike and
Nucleoprotein, including effector, helper and memory T cells. By characterizing 2,943 Spikereactive T cell clones, we found that 34% of the clones and 93% of the patients recognized a
conserved immunodominant region encompassing residues S346-365 in the RBD and comprising
three nested HLA-DR and HLA-DP restricted epitopes. By using pre- and post-COVID-19
samples and Spike proteins from alpha and beta coronaviruses, we provide in vivo evidence of
cross-reactive T cell responses targeting multiple sites in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The
possibility of leveraging immunodominant and cross-reactive T helper epitopes is instrumental for
vaccination strategies that can be rapidly adapted to counteract emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

The prompt identification of T cell epitopes in disease causing organisms is a considerable
challenge in view of the polymorphism of HLA class II molecules and the variability of rapidly
mutating pathogens. Bioinformatic analysis is widely used to predict peptide binding to HLA
molecules and to identify candidate targets of the T cell response (1). In the context of the COVID19 pandemic, this approach has been used to predict T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins (2,
3) and to produce peptide pools that have been used to stimulate PBMCs in order to identify and
enumerate antigen-specific T cells. These studies revealed a robust CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response
against SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Membrane, Nucleoprotein and non-structural proteins in recovered
patients (2-6) and a level of cross-reactivity with other circulating human coronaviruses in prepandemic samples (7-9).
A limitation of bioinformatic-based predictions is the difficulty to identify immunodominant
epitopes, since immunodominance depends on multiple factors such as the constraints related to
processing of whole proteins, the available T cell repertoire, HLA alleles and preexisting crossreactive immunity (10-12). To identify naturally processed immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes
we took an unbiased approach of stimulating memory CD4+ T cells with protein-pulsed
professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), followed by the isolation of T cell clones that were
used to precisely map the epitope recognized (13). In addition, TCR Vb sequencing was used to
define diversity and frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific clonotypes within memory subsets and to
estimate the extent of cross-reactivity with other coronavirus Spike proteins.
To analyze the CD4+ T cell response elicited by SARS-CoV-2, we collected blood samples from
patients who had recovered from mild to severe COVID-19 disease 43-164 days post symptoms
onset or positive PCR test (Table S1). From PBMCs of a first cohort of 14 patients, we isolated
total CD4+ memory T cells or CD4+ T central memory (Tcm), T effector memory (Tem) and T
circulating follicular helper (cTfh) cells (Fig. S1A). The cells were labelled with CFSE and
stimulated with autologous monocytes in the presence of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike or
Nucleoprotein. In all patients we observed a strong proliferative response towards both antigens,
as measured on day 6 by CFSE dilution, upregulation of ICOS and CD25 and production of IFNg, the latter being primarily detected in the Tcm and Tem subsets (Fig. 1A, B and Fig. S1B, C).
The proliferative response was overall comparable in the three memory subsets, consistent with
priming of both inflammatory Th1, helper T and memory T cells. In contrast, in unexposed
individuals, the CD4+ memory T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins was low or undetectable
(Fig. 1B and Fig. S1C), consistent with the presence of a few cross-reactive T cells primed by
seasonal coronaviruses (4, 5, 9).
The clonal composition of SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cell lines and the relationship
between different memory subsets was studied in three patients (P28, P31 and P33) by TCR Vb
sequencing of Spike-stimulated and Nucleoprotein-stimulated CFSElo T cell lines generated from
each of the memory subsets. The Tcm, Tem and cTfh cell lines generated from the three patients
comprised on average 908, 480 and 697 Spike-reactive clonotypes and 1,452, 623 and 908

Nucleoprotein-reactive clonotypes, respectively (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). Interestingly, several of the
most expanded clonotypes were shared between two and even among all three subsets, as shown
by a high similarity index (Fig. 1C, D). Collectively, these findings reveal a robust polyclonal
CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The polyfunctional response and the sharing of
clonotypes among Tcm, Tem and cTfh cells is consistent with previous studies on the lineage
relationship of CD4+ T cell subsets and with the intraclonal diversification of antigen primed CD4+
T cells (14, 15).
In view of the interest in vaccine design, we analyzed in depth the CD4+ T cell response to the
Spike protein and in particular to the RBD, which is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (16,
17). CD4+ memory T cells from a larger cohort of 34 COVID-19 recovered patients (Table S1)
were stimulated with Spike protein-pulsed APCs and proliferating T cells were isolated by cell
sorting and cloned by limiting dilution. Using this approach, we obtained 2,943 T cell clones and
mapped their specificity using 3 pools of 15-mer peptides overlapping of 10 spanning the S1-325
and S536-685 sequences (pool S1ΔRBD, comprising 91 peptides), the S316-545 sequence (pool
RBD, comprising 44 peptides) and the S676-1273 sequence (pool S2, comprising 118 peptides)
(Fig. 2A, B). Most donors analyzed (32 out of 34) had T cell clones specific for the RBD region
(Fig. 2B). Further experiments using recombinant RBD to stimulate CD4+ memory T cells led to
the isolation of additional clones from all patients tested, including P8 and P21. Collectively, these
findings demonstrate that, in spite of its relatively small size, the RBD is recognized by CD4+ T
cells of all individuals tested and accounts on average for 20% of the CD4+ T cell response to the
Spike protein (Fig. 2B).
Using a matrix-based approach, we mapped the epitope specificity of 1,149 RBD-reactive CD4+
T cell clones isolated from 30 patients (Fig. 2C). This analysis showed that in each patient T cell
clones recognize multiple sites that altogether covered almost all the RBD sequence. Individual
patterns were clearly evident, most likely reflecting restriction by different HLA class II molecules.
However, certain regions emerged as immunodominant, such as those spanning residues S346385 and S446-485 (Fig. 2C). Strikingly, a 20 amino acid region (S346-365) was recognized by
93% of the donors (28 out of 30) and by 34% of the clones (396 out of 1,149) (Fig. 2D). This
region is highly conserved among human Sarbecoviruses, including the recently emerged variants
of concern (VOC), and zoonotic Sarbecoviruses (Fig. 2E) (18). RBD-specific and S346-365specific clones were found in the Tcm, Tem and cTfh subsets, consistent with priming of effector
and memory T cells (Fig. S3A, B). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that RBD is highly
immunogenic in vivo and identify a large number of naturally processed T cell epitopes including
a conserved immunodominant region.
To dissect the CD4+ T cell response to the immunodominant S346-365 region, we sequenced TCR
Vb chains of 323 specific T cell clones. The 200 clonotypes identified used a broad spectrum of
TCR Vb genes and, even in the same donor, carried different CDR3 sequences (Fig. 3A, B and
Table S2). The TCR Vb sequences of T cell clones specific for the S346-365 region isolated from

patients P31 and P33 were also detected in the repertoire of total CD4+ memory T cells
immediately after isolation from peripheral blood and some of them were among the top 5%
clonotypes (Fig. 3C).
To determine the HLA class II isotype used by S346-365-specific T cell clones, we stimulated the
clones in the presence of blocking antibodies to HLA-DR, -DP and -DQ (Fig. 3D, E). Most of the
T cell clones analyzed (n = 240 from 20 patients) were HLA-DR-restricted, while the remaining
(45 from 4 patients) were HLA-DP-restricted and one was HLA-DQ-restricted. The minimal
peptide epitope recognized by HLA-DR- and HLA-DP-restricted T cell clones was mapped using
a panel of truncated peptides (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, while HLA-DR-restricted clones from P31,
P32 and P33 recognized the same 10 amino acid peptide (VYAWNRKRIS), HLA-DR-restricted
clones from P29 recognized a different 12 amino acid peptide (RFASVYAWNRKR) and HLADP-restricted clones from P33 recognized an 11 amino acid peptide (NRKRISNCVAD).
Collectively, these findings indicate that the S346-365 region comprises at least three nested
epitopes recognized in association with different allelic forms of HLA-DR or HLA-DP by T cell
clones that use a large set of TCR Vb genes and CDR3 of different sequence and length.
To address the extent of T cell cross-reactivity between different Spike proteins, SARS-CoV-2
Spike-specific T cell lines from patients P28 and P33 were re-labelled with CFSE and stimulated
with autologous monocytes pulsed with Spike proteins from other beta (SARS-CoV, HKU1 and
OC43) or alpha (NL63 and 229E) coronaviruses. In these patients, a robust proliferation of SARSCoV-2-specific T cell lines in the secondary cultures was observed in response to SARS-CoV and
HKU1 (Fig. 4A). TCR Vb sequencing of primary and secondary cultures identified a subset of
cross-reactive clonotypes (Fig. S4). Out of 1,674 and 568 clonotypes present in the primary SARSCoV-2-specific T cell lines from P28 and P33, 17% and 25% were found in SARS-CoV secondary
cultures and 11% and 15% were found in HKU1 secondary cultures. Remarkably, 7% and 8% of
the clonotypes were found in both SARS-CoV and HKU1 stimulated cultures suggesting the
existence of T cell clones with broad specificity. To corroborate this finding, we isolated from
secondary cultures several T cell clones that proliferated in response to 2 or even 3 different Spike
proteins (Fig. 4B and Table S3). Importantly, the dose response curves indicate recognition of
naturally processed peptides with similar functional avidity.
To ask whether cross-reactive T cells could be detected in pre-COVID-19 samples and could be
expanded early on following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the T cell response in a COVID19 recovered patient from whom we had previously cryopreserved PBMCs. Memory CD4+ T cells
from pre- and post-COVID-19 samples were stimulated with a panel of recombinant Spike proteins
(Fig. 4C). In this individual, a robust T cell proliferation in the pre-COVID-19 sample was detected
primarily against alpha coronaviruses NL63 and 229E, while the response to beta coronaviruses
HKU1 and OC43 was limited and the response to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable.
Conversely, in the post-COVID-19 sample a strong T cell proliferation was observed not only in
response to SARS-CoV-2, but also in response to all other alpha and beta coronavirus Spike

proteins. This was accompanied by the appearance of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as
an increase in serum antibody titers against HKU1 and OC43 (J.S.L., unpublished data).
The striking increase in the response to unrelated Spike proteins in the post-COVID-19 sample
may be caused by the recall of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells or the priming of crossreactive T cells. To measure the extent of cross-reactivity, we isolated T cell clones from SARSCoV-2-, SARS-CoV-, OC43- or NL63-reactive memory T cell lines and found that a variable
proportion of these clones proliferated in response to a SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptide pool (Fig. 4D).
The specificity of cross-reactive T cell clones was further mapped using peptide pools to the
different SARS-CoV-2 Spike domains and was found to be primarily directed against the S2
domain but to comprise also T cell clones reactive to the S1 or RBD domain (Fig. 4E).
Collectively, these findings identify, at the clonal level, an extensive CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity
among coronavirus Spike proteins, which primarily targets the S2 domain, consistent with its
higher degree of sequence identity (19-21).
Using naturally processed antigens for the isolation of almost 3,000 CD4+ T cell clones, we
unbiasedly mapped the T cell epitopes recognized by patients recovered from COVID-19. At
variance with initial reports, we document a robust CD4+ T cell response to the RBD and identified
a conserved immunodominant region encompassing residues S346-365 in the RBD that is
recognized by virtually all donors, a finding that is relevant for vaccine design since the RBD is
also the target of most neutralizing antibodies (16, 17). These findings were not anticipated in
previous studies based on bioinformatics predictions (2, 3) and short-term peptide stimulation of
bulk PBMCs, highlighting the value and suitability of classical unbiased T cell stimulation and
cloning approach for the dissection of antigen-specific T cell repertoires.
The reason for the immunodominance of RBD S346-365 may be due to the presence of at least
three nested T cell epitopes presented by HLA-DR and HLA-DP as shown in this study, but may
also be due to the relative abundance of naturally processed peptides, as previously observed in
the context of the immunodominant response to influenza hemagglutinin (13). Indeed, peptides
spanning the immunodominant regions here identified were also detected by HLA class II
immunopeptidomics in dendritic cells pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (22). Interestingly,
the immunodominant S346-365 region is conserved among different Sarbecoviruses and has not
been found mutated in the new SARS-CoV-2 VOC isolates. Furthermore, this region is also a
contact site for a broadly reactive neutralizing antibody (23), providing a striking example of
convergence of T and B cells around a conserved epitope.
Sequencing of TCR Vb locus in T cell clones and polyclonal cultures reveals that SARS-CoV-2
infection primes a large CD4+ T cell response comprising inflammatory and helper T cells, as well
as precursors of long-lived memory T cells. In this primary response, it was interesting to find
evidence for an extensive clonal diversification towards different fates and functions, as previously
demonstrated in mice and in in vitro primed human naïve T cells (14, 15). Furthermore, the
detection of a large repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 reactive cTfh cells is indicative of robust germinal

center reaction, which is necessary for the deployment of high affinity antibodies (24). Follow-up
studies on clonotype dynamics and persistence will allow to dissect the development of T cell
memory to a relevant pathogen and to test different models of memory generation (25).
Our results also highlight the extensive cross-reactivity of Spike-specific T cells that can be
documented in vivo and not only between the closely related Sarbecoviruses (SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV) but also with the more divergent endemic coronaviruses. The availability of a large
number of cross-reactive T cell clones is not only instrumental to define target sites in relevant
pathogens but also to understand whether cross-reactivity is due to epitope structural similarities
or to TCR binding degeneracy (11, 26).
While the narrow specificity of neutralizing antibodies can readily select escape mutants, the
extensive sequence coverage and breadth observed in the CD4+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2
Spike antigen offers an opportunity for vaccine design. The possibility of leveraging a robust crossreactive T helper cell function against conserved sites will be instrumental to drive neutralizing
antibody responses to adaptive vaccines that incorporate escape mutations found in emerging
SARS-CoV-2 variants.

and CD4 magnetic microbeads, respectively (Miltenyi Biotech). Total CD4+ cells were stained at
37°C for 15 min with a primary anti-human-CXCR5 (clone 51505; cat. no. MAB190) from BioTechne, followed by staining with a biotinylated secondary goat anti-mouse IgG2b (cat. no. 109008) from Southern Biotech. After washing, cells were stained with PE/Cy7-Streptavidin (cat. no.
405206) from BioLegend, and with the following fluorochrome-labeled mouse monoclonal
antibodies: CD8-PE-Cy5 (clone B9.11; cat. no. A07758), CD56-PE/Cy5 (clone N901; cat. no.
A07789) from Beckman Coulter, CD25-PE (clone M-A251; cat. no. 555432) from BD
Biosciences, CD4-PE–Texas Red (clone S3.5; cat. no. MHCD0417), CD45RA-Qdot 655 (clone
MEM-56; cat. no. Q10069) from ThermoFisher Scientific, CCR7-BV421 (clone G043H7; cat. no.
353208) from BioLegend. Memory CD4+ T cells were sorted to over 98% purity on a FACSAria
III (BD) after exclusion of CD8+, CD56+, CD25br cells and CD45RA+CCR7+) naïve CD4+ T cells.
In some experiments, memory CD4+ T cells were divided in cTfh (sorted as CXCR5+ cells), Tcm
(sorted as CCR7+CXCR5– cells) and Tem (sorted as CCR7–CXCR5– cells).
Antigens and peptides
The following recombinant proteins were purchased from Sino Biological Inc: SARS-CoV-2
(2019-nCoV) Spike protein (S1+S2 ECD, cat.no. 40589-V08B1), SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV)
Nucleocapsid protein (cat.no. 40588-V08B), SARS-CoV (S577A, Isolate Tor2) Spike protein
(S1+S2 ECD, cat.no. 40634-V08B), HCoV-HKU1 (isolate N5) Spike protein (S1+S2 ECD, cat.no.
40606-V08B). Peptides were synthesized as crude material on a small scale (1 mg) by Pepscan
(Lelystad, The Netherlands). Peptides used in the study included 15mers overlapping of 10
covering the entire sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (UniProtKB: P0DTC2; 253
peptides).
Cell culture and T cell stimulation
T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 1% (vol/vol)
nonessential amino acids, 1% (vol/vol) sodium pyruvate, penicillin (50 U/ml), streptomycin (50
µg/ml) (all from Invitrogen) and 5% human serum (Swiss Red Cross). Sorted memory CD4+ T
cells were labelled with 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE,
ThermoFisher) and cultured at a ratio of 2:1 with irradiated autologous monocytes untreated or
pulsed for 3 h with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (2.5 μg/ml). After 6 days, cells were
stained with antibodies to CD25-PE (clone M-A251; cat. no. 555432) from BD Biosciences and
ICOS-APC (clone C398.4A; cat. no. 313510) from BioLegend. Cytokine concentrations in the day
6 supernatants of antigen-stimulated cultures were assessed by Luminex bead-based assay
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proliferating, activated T
cells were FACS-sorted as CFSEloCD25+ICOS+, expanded in vitro in the presence of IL-2 (500
IU/ml) and cloned by limiting dilution. In some experiments, CFSElo cultures were relabeled with
CFSE and re-stimulated with antigen-pulsed irradiated autologous monocytes; readout of T cell
proliferation was determined at day 4-5 after secondary stimulation.

Isolation and characterization of T cell clones
T cell clones were isolated from CFSE-low cells by limiting dilution using 1 μg/mL PHA-P,
1000U/ml IL-2 and allogeneic irradiated PBMCs. T cell clone reactivity was determined by
stimulation with a set of 253 synthetic peptides (15mers overlapping of 10) spanning SARS-CoV2 Spike protein (1.5 μM per peptide) in the presence of irradiated autologous monocytes or EBVimmortalized B cells as APCs. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 Spike domains targeted by T cell
clones, the set of 253 peptides was grouped in 3 different pools spanning the following amino acid
ranges: S1-325 and S536-685 (pool S1ΔRBD, comprising 91 peptides); S316-545 (pool RBD,
comprising 44 peptides); S676-1273 (pool S2, comprising 118 peptides). To determine the
minimal sequence targeted by SARS-CoV-2 RBD-reactive T cell clones, the 44 peptides
comprising the pool RBD were subdivided into 5 horizontal and 5 vertical peptide pools to
construct a RBD epitope mapping matrix. Epitope mapping of SARS-CoV-2 RBD was performed
by stimulation of T cell clones with irradiated autologous APCs, untreated or pre-pulsed with the
RBD epitope mapping matrix (1.5 μM per peptide). Specificity to a region of 20 amino acids was
assigned upon reactivity to one of the 5 horizontal and one of the 5 vertical pools. In some
experiments, SARS-CoV-2 Spike peptides were titrated by serial dilution. To determine HLA
restriction, T cell clones were stimulated with autologous APCs pulsed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike
peptides, in the absence or presence of blocking anti-class II monoclonal antibodies produced in
house from hybridoma cell lines (anti-HLA-DR, clone L243 from ATCC, cat. no. HB-55; antiHLA-DQ, clone SPVL3 (27); anti-HLA-DP, clone B7/21 (28), anti-pan-MHC-class-II, clone
IVA12 from ATCC, cat. no. HB-145). In all experiments proliferation was assessed on day 3, after
incubation for 16 h with 1 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]-thymidine (Perkin Elmer). Data were expressed as
counts per min (Cpm) or as Dcpm after subtraction of control cultures performed in the absence of
antigen.
Sequence analysis of TCR Vβ genes
Sequence analysis of rearranged TCR Vβ genes of T cell clones was performed as previously
described. Briefly, cDNA from individual T cell clones was obtained by reverse transcription of
total RNA from 103-104 cells per reaction. Rearranged TCR Vβ genes were PCR amplified using
forward primer pool targeting Vβ genes, and reverse primer pairing to C1–C2 β-chain constant
region. Sequence amplification was assessed through agarose gel electrophoresis; successfully
amplified fragments were sequenced by Sanger method, and TCR sequence annotation was carried
out by using IMGT/V-QUEST algorithm (29).
TCR Vβ deep sequencing
Ex vivo-sorted memory CD4+ T cell subsets and CFSElo fractions of antigen-stimulated memory
CD4+ T cell cultures were analyzed by deep sequencing. In brief, 5×105 T cells were centrifuged
and washed in PBS and genomic DNA was extracted from the pellet using QIAamp DNA Micro
Kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA quantity and purity were
assessed through spectrophotometric analysis. Sequencing of TCR Vβ CDR3 was performed by

Adaptive Biotechnologies using the ImmunoSEQ assay (http://www.immunoseq.com). In brief,
following multiplex PCR reaction designed to target any CDR3 Vβ fragments; amplicons were
sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Raw data consisting of all retrieved sequences of
87 nucleotides or corresponding amino acid sequences and containing the CDR3 region were
exported and further processed. The assay was performed at deep level for ex vivo-sorted memory
CD4+ T cell subsets (detection sensitivity, 1 cell in 200,000) and at survey level for CFSElo antigenreactive cultures (detection sensitivity, 1 cell in 40,000). Each TCR Vβ clonotype was defined as
the unique combination of a productively rearranged CDR3 amino acid sequence and its related V
and J genes (bioidentity); data processing was done using the productive frequency of templates
provided by ImmunoSEQ Analyzer V.3.0 (http://www.immunoseq.com). For each repertoire, a
frequency corresponding to the top 5th percentile in the frequency-ranked list of unique clonotypes
was chosen as threshold (top 5%). Chao-Jaccard overlap between pairs of TCR Vβ repertoires was
calculated using R package “fossil” (30).

Characterization of representative T cell clones (n = 72) from patient P20. Proliferation was
assessed on day 3 after a 16-h pulse with 3H-thymidine and expressed as counts per minute after
subtraction of the unstimulated control value (Dcpm). (B) Percentage of T cell clones specific for
S1DRBD (white), RBD (black), and S2 (grey) in the 34 patients tested; the number of clones tested
is indicated for each patient. The distribution of all Spike-reactive T cell clones isolated from 34
COVID-19 patients (ALL, n = 2,943) is also indicated. (C) RBD-specific T cell clones (n = 1,149)
isolated from 30 patients were further characterized for their epitope specificity using 15mer
peptides overlapping by 10 spanning the S316-545 RBD sequence. The 20mer specificity of each
clone is represented by a horizontal line and the total number of clones mapped for each patient is
indicated on the right. (D) Percentage of clones specific and percentage of donors carrying T cells
specific for different 20mer segments of the RBD. Data for the immunodominant region S346-365
is indicated in red. (E) Multiple sequence alignment of the immunodominant region S346-365 of
SARS-CoV-2 with homologous sequences in different Sarbecoviruses, Human and animal SARSrelated coronaviruses are arranged by clades. Amino acid numbers of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
are reported on top. Amino acid substitutions compared to SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1/2019
reference strain are reported; dots indicate identity to SARS-CoV-2 reference strain.

Figure 3. The immunodominant S346-365 RBD region contains nested peptides targeted by T
cells restricted by HLA-DR and HLA-DP. (A, B) Rearranged TCR Vβ sequences of S346-365reactive CD4+ T cell clones (n = 323) isolated from 23 patients were determined by RT-PCR
followed by Sanger sequencing. (A) TCR Vβ gene usage in the 200 unique clonotypes identified
from S346-365-reactive T cell clones. Each slice of the chart indicates a different Vβ gene. The
size of each slice is proportional to the number of unique TCR Vβ clonotypes using that particular
Vβ gene. Color-coded legend is reported for the top 21 Vβ genes (used by at least 4 different TCR
Vβ clonotypes). (B) Number of S346-365-reactive T cell clones and clonotypes identified in the
23 patients. Each slice of the chart indicates a different TCR Vβ clonotype. The size of each slice
is proportional to the number of sister clones bearing the same TCR Vβ sequence. The number of
clones analyzed from each patient is reported on top of each pie chart; the number of TCR Vβ
clonotypes identified is reported at the center. (C) Frequency distribution of TCR Vβ clonotypes
from CD4+ Tcm Tem and cTfh subsets sequenced directly after ex vivo isolation from patients
P31 and P33. Colored circles mark the TCR Vβ clonotypes found among the S346-365-specific T
cell clones isolated from the same patient. Dotted lines in the graphs indicate the frequency
threshold of the top 5% expanded clonotypes. (D) HLA class II isotype restriction of S346-365specific T cell clones (n = 10) isolated from P33 was determined by stimulation with peptidepulsed autologous APCs in the absence (control) or in the presence of blocking antibodies to HLADR, -DP, -DQ or pan HLA class II. Proliferation was assessed on day 3 after a 16-h pulse with 3Hthymidine. Data are expressed as percentage of control counts per minute (Cpm). (E) Distribution
of HLA class II isotype restrictions of S346-365-reactive CD4+ T cell clones (n = 286) isolated
from 22 patients, as determined by >80% inhibition of proliferation. (F) The minimal peptide
recognized by S346-365-reactive CD4+ T cell clones (n = 12) isolated from 4 patients was mapped
by stimulation with autologous APCs pulsed with a panel of truncated peptides. Proliferation was
assessed on day 3 after a 16-h pulse with 3H-thymidine and expressed as counts per minute (Cpm).
The minimal amino acid sequences recognized by T cell clones are highlighted with colored
shading.

Figure 4. Identification of cross-reactive T cell clones by heterologous stimulations with Spike
antigens. (A) CFSE-labelled CD4+ memory T cells were stimulated with recombinant SARS-CoV2 Spike protein in the presence of autologous monocytes. CFSElo cells were expanded with IL-2
for 10 days, re-labelled and re-stimulated with SARS-CoV or HCoV-HKU1 Spike protein.
Negative controls of T cells cultured with monocytes in the absence of antigen are reported as
dashed lines. Shown are experiments performed with samples from patient P28 and P33. (B)

Proliferative response of representative T cell clones isolated from P28 and P33 to autologous
APCs pulsed with titrated doses of recombinant Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 (black), SARSCoV (grey) or HCoV-HKU1 (white). (C) Proliferative response of memory CD4+ T cells isolated
from P34 two years before and 1.5 months after COVID-19. CFSE-labelled cells were stimulated
as above with different recombinant Spike proteins. (D) Proliferative response of patient P34 T
cell clones isolated from the post-COVID-19 CFSElo fractions shown above. The T cell clones
were stimulated with autologous APCs pulsed with a pool of peptides spanning the entire SARSCoV-2 Spike protein. Pie charts show the total number of clones tested and the fraction of
responsive clones. (E) Reactivity of T cell clones isolated from each culture (in D) was mapped
by stimulation with autologous APCs pulsed with pools of peptides spanning the S1DRBD (white),
RBD (black), and S2 (grey) regions of SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The histograms show the percentage
of clones specific for each region. Total number of clones tested is indicated on top.

cells as in Fig. 2 and their specificity was mapped using autologous APCs pulsed with pools of
peptides spanning the S1DRBD (white), RBD (black), and S2 (grey) regions of SARS-CoV-2
Spike. (B) RBD-specific T cell clones were further stimulated using a matrix of 15mer peptides
overlapping of 10. Each line represents the specificity of a clone mapped to a 20 amino acid region.
The colors indicate the subset of origin of each clone; the number of clones analyzed for each
patient is indicated on the right.

Fig. S4. Repertoire analysis of cross-reactive CD4+ T cells. (A, B) Dot plots show for patient P28
(A) and P33 (B) the shared TCR Vb clonotypes between sorted CFSElo T cells isolated following
primary stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and sorted CFSElo T cells isolated following
secondary re-stimulation with SARS-CoV or HCo-HKU1 Spike proteins. Frequencies are shown
as percentage of productive templates. Total number of clonotypes is indicated in the x and y axis.
Values in the upper right corner represent the number of clonotypes shared between two samples.
The Venn diagrams show the number of clonotypes shared among different Spike-reactive
cultures.
