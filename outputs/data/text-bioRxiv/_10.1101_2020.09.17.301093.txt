Short title: COVID-19 infection in Rhesus and Cynomolgus macaques

32
33

ABSTRACT

34

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the causative agent of the

35

current COVID-19 pandemic. Animal models, and in particular non-human primates,

36

are essential to understand the pathogenesis of emerging diseases and to the safety

37

and efficacy of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2

38

replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract and causes pulmonary lesions in

39

both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, resembling the mild clinical cases of

40

COVID-19 in humans. Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were also similar in

41

both species and equivalent to those reported in milder infections and convalescent

42

human patients. Importantly, we have devised a new method for lung histopathology

43

scoring that will provide a metric to enable clearer decision making for this key

44

endpoint. In contrast to prior publications, in which rhesus are accepted to be the

45

optimal study species, we provide convincing evidence that both macaque species

46

authentically represent mild to moderate forms of COVID-19 observed in the majority

47

of the human population and both species should be used to evaluate the safety and

48

efficacy of novel and repurposed interventions against SARS-CoV-2. Accessing

49

cynomolgus macaques will greatly alleviate the pressures on current rhesus stocks.

INTRODUCTION

51

A novel acute respiratory syndrome, now called Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)

52

was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The genetic sequence of the

53

causative agent was found to have similarity with two highly pathogenic respiratory

54

beta Coronaviruses, SARS 1 and MERS 2, and was later called SARS-CoV-2 3. It has

55

currently infected >21 million individuals resulting in >750,000 deaths 4. Among the

56

clinical and pathological signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, pneumonia

57

accompanied by respiratory distress seem to be the most clinically relevant 5,6.

58
59

The development of animal models that replicate human disease is a crucial step in

60

the study of pathogenesis and transmission, in addition to the assessment of the

61

safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines and therapeutics. Due to their obvious

62

physiological similarities to humans, non-human primates (NHPs), such as

63

macaques, have long been recognised as the most clinically relevant animal for

64

development of in vivo models of human disease. Prior NHP models developed for

65

SARS and MERS have shown respiratory induced pathology with similar features as

66

those seen in humans, including diffuse alveolar damage. For SARS, though rhesus

67

macaques became the preferred species, the literature suggests there is no

68

significant difference in susceptibility of cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) or rhesus

69

macaques (Macaca mulatta) to infection, virus replication and pathology

70

studies have shown that rhesus macaques 11,12 and cynomolgus macaques 13 can be

71

infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the disease course resembles some features of human

72

COVID-19 infection. Rhesus macaques appear to display more extensive lung

73

pathology and clinical signs, however a direct comparison of species, based on

74

these studies, is not possible because different strains of virus, dose and route of

3

7-10

. Recent

75

administration have been used. There is an accepted preference to use rhesus

76

macaques for the assessment of COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics, based on the

77

limited number of studies that have been performed. A head-to-head comparison of

78

rhesus versus cynomolgus macaques, under the same experimental conditions, is

79

urgently required as there are now acute pressures on rhesus stocks that will impact

80

on the ability to perform safety and efficacy studies on new vaccines and

81

therapeutics.

82
83

This unique study aims to evaluate the outcome of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a

84

head to head comparison of two macaque species: rhesus macaque (Indian

85

genotype) and cynomolgus macaque (Mauritian genotype) exposed to the same well

86

characterized strain of challenge virus. The resulting disease course in each species

87

was closely compared for the first time.

88
89
90

Similar to recent NHP studies, a dose of 5x106 pfu of SARS-CoV-2/Victoria/01/2020
14

, was delivered via the intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) route to groups of each

91

species comprising six animals. Sequential body fluid sampling and culls (at days

92

4/5, 14/15 and 18/19) were performed to support a comprehensive comparative

93

assessment of clinical signs, pathology, virology and immunology.

RESULTS

97

Clinical signs and in-life imaging by CT scan

98

Six rhesus macaques of Indian genotype and six cynomolgus macaques of Mauritian

99

genotype were obtained from established UK Government breeding colonies. Study

100

groups comprised three males and three females of each species and all were adults

101

aged two to four years with body weights ranging between 2.89 - 4.85kg at time of

102

challenge. Animals were challenged with a total of 5x106 pfu of SARS-CoV-

103

2/Victoria/01/2020 administered in volumes of 2 ml by the intratracheal route (using a

104

bronchoscope for accurate placement right above the carinal bifurcation) and 1 ml by

105

the intranasal route (0.5 ml in each nostril). Whole genome sequencing of the viral

106

challenge stock, used in this study (Passage 3), confirmed there were no significant

107

changes following passage in Vero/hSLAM cells, compared to the original isolate

108

(Passage 1).

109
110

No significant weight loss or changes in body temperature were observed throughout

111

the experiment. Adverse clinical signs were not recorded for any animal despite

112

frequent monitoring during the study period.

113
114

Images from CT scans collected 18 days after challenge from two rhesus and two

115

cynomolgus macaques, were examined by an expert thoracic radiologist with

116

experience of non-human primate prior CT interpretation and human COVID-19 CT

117

features, blinded to the clinical status. Pulmonary abnormalities that involved less

118

than 25% of the lung and reflected those characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

119

humans, were identified in one rhesus macaque and both cynomolgus macaques

120

(Figure 1). Ground glass opacity was observed in all three macaques showing

121

abnormal lung structure, with peripheral consolidation also seen in one cynomolgus

122

macaque. Abnormalities occurred in the peripheral two thirds of the middle and lower

123

lung lobes in the two cynomolgus macaques and in a random pattern in the upper,

124

middle and lower lobes of the rhesus macaque. Pulmonary emboli were not

125

identified in any of the subjects.

126
127

Viral load in clinical samples

128

Viral load in the upper respiratory tract (URT) (nasal washes and throat swabs),

129

gastrointestinal tract (rectal swabs) and in systemic samples (EDTA blood) was

130

assessed by RT-qPCR at regular intervals throughout the study, and in

131

bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) collected at necropsy (Figure 2). High levels of viral

132

RNA (>106 cDNA copies/ml) were detected in nasal wash samples collected from

133

both species one day post challenge (dpc). In rhesus macaques, viral RNA in nasal

134

washes peaked at two dpc at 6.9±2.3 x 107 cDNA copies/ml and levels remained

135

between 2.9 x 105 and 4.8 x 107 cDNA copies/ml until eleven dpc, before decreasing

136

to ≤1.8 x 104 cDNA copies/ml by 18 dpc. Cynomolgus macaques displayed a similar

137

pattern of viral RNA burden in nasal wash samples with peak levels detected at three

138

dpc. However, levels later in infection remained higher with titres of 2.0 x 106 cDNA

139

copies/ml at 15 dpc and 1.6 x105 cDNA copies/ml at 19 dpc (Figure 2A).

140
141

Viral load in throat swabs largely mirrored that in nasal washes with peak levels early

142

in infection, although, overall titres were lower. This was most notable at two dpc

143

(Figure 2B). In rhesus macaques, viral RNA was detected above the lower limit of

144

quantification (LLOQ - 2.66 x103 copies/ml) in all but one animal between one and

145

three dpc and remained ≥1.5x104 copies/ml for all animals between four and nine

146

dpc before falling and remaining below the assay's lower limit of detection (LLOD)

147

from eleven dpc to 18 dpc. Throat swabs from cynomolgus macaques contained

148

higher levels of viral RNA early in infection (one to three dpc) and remained ≥4.5 x

149

104 copies/ml for all animals between four and nine dpc.

150
151

Viral load in BAL samples echoed URT samples, with high (≥9.8 x 106 copies/ml)

152

levels in both species at four and five dpc, dropping to ≤2.4 x 104 copies/ml and ≤1.9

153

x 104 copies/ml at 14 dpc and 15 dpc in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques,

154

respectively (Fig. 2C).

155
156

Virus shedding from the gastrointestinal tract was assessed by RT-qPCR performed

157

on rectal swab samples. In rhesus macaques, low levels of viral RNA were detected

158

from one dpc to nine dpc. In cynomolgus macaques, viral RNA was similarly

159

detected at a low level in rectal swabs from one dpc to nine dpc. However viral RNA

160

levels above the LLOQ were detected at both three dpc and five dpc in cynomolgus

161

macaques in comparison to two dpc and three dpc in rhesus macaques (Figure 2D).

162

Viral RNA was detected at only two timepoints after challenge in whole blood

163

samples and remained below the LLOQ throughout the study (Figure 2E). In rhesus

164

macaques, viral RNA was detected in one animal at three dpc, whilst in cynomolgus

165

macaques, viral RNA was detected in two animals at six dpc.

166
167

Samples collected from the upper respiratory tract at each study time point were

168

evaluated using a Vero cell-based plaque assay for the presence of viable virus.

169

Viable virus was successfully recovered from two of the six rhesus macaques and

170

three of the six cynomolgus macaques on the first occasion of sampling (one to three

171

dpc). In all cases, recovery was below 100 pfu/mL based on a figure of under 10

172

plaques in a single well. Virus was not recovered from any nasal wash samples

173

collected from four dpc onwards.

174
175

Pathological changes

176

Gross pathological changes were found in the lungs of all animals from both species

177

and sexes euthanised 4/5 days after challenge and consisted of multiple areas of

178

mild to moderate consolidation distributed in cranial and caudal lobes. At 14/15 and

179

18/19 dpc, only small areas of consolidation were observed. Macroscopic

180

remarkable changes were not observed in any other organ analysed in this study at

181

any time point.

182

Histological changes in the lungs of all twelve animals from both species, consistent

183

with infection with SARS-CoV-2, were observed. The changes were most prominent

184

at 4/5 dpc and thereafter were less severe, indicating resolution of the more acute

185

changes observed at early time points.

186
187

4/5 days after challenge, the lung parenchyma in the cynomolgus macaques was

188

comprised of multifocal to coalescing areas of pneumonia, surrounded by unaffected

189

parenchyma. Overall, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was a prominent feature in the

190

affected areas, characterised by individual, shrunken, eosinophilic cells in alveolar

191

walls, with pyknotic or karyorrhectic nuclei (Figure 3A). In these areas, alveolar

192

spaces were often obliterated by collapse of the thickened and damaged alveolar

193

walls which contained mixed inflammatory cells (Figure 3A); or had obvious, alveolar

194

type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia (alveolar epithelialisation), as well as expanded

195

alveolar spaces (Figure 3B). Alveolar spaces were expanded and filled with fibrillar

8

196

to homogenous, eosinophilic, proteinaceous fluid (alveolar oedema) (Figure 3A),

197

admixed with fibrin, polymorph neutrophils (PMNs), enlarged alveolar macrophages

198

and other round cells (possibly detached type 2 pneumocytes). In distal bronchioles

199

and bronchiolo-alveolar junctions, degeneration and sloughing of epithelial cells was

200

present, with areas of attenuation and foci of plump, type 2 pneumocytes

201

representing regeneration.

202
203

In the larger airways occasional, focal, epithelial degeneration and sloughing was

204

observed in the bronchial epithelium, with evidence of regeneration, characterised by

205

small, basophilic epithelial cells. Low numbers of mixed inflammatory cells,

206

comprising PMNs, lymphoid cells, and occasional eosinophils, infiltrated bronchial

207

and bronchiolar walls. In the lumen of some airways, fibrillar, eosinophilic material

208

(mucus), admixed with degenerative cells, mainly PMNs and epithelial cells, was

209

seen. Occasionally, multinucleated cells, characterised as large, irregularly shaped

210

cells with prominent, eosinophilic cytoplasm and multiple round nuclei, resembling

211

syncytial cells (Figure 3B, inset) were observed.

212
213

Pathological changes consistent with those described for cynomolgus macaques

214

were present in the lungs of rhesus macaques. In the parenchyma, multifocal

215

expansion and infiltration of alveolar walls by inflammatory cells was noted (Figure

216

3E). Furthermore, in these areas, DAD was observed with patchy alveolar oedema

217

and hyperplasia of alveolar macrophages (Figure 3F). In the bronchi and

218

bronchioles, similar changes to those described for cynomolgus macaques were

219

seen.

221

Presence of viral RNA was observed in the lungs from all animals at 4/5 dpc by in

222

situ hybridisation. Prominent staining of small foci of cells containing SARS-CoV-2

223

viral RNA, was observed within the alveolar walls, concomitant with microscopic

224

changes in cynomolgus macaques (Figure 3C). Staining was not seen in cells or

225

fluid within the alveolar spaces. Positive cells were also observed rarely in the

226

bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) (Figure 3C, insert). Abundant numbers

227

of cells expressing IL-6 mRNA were observed within the pulmonary lesions (Figure

228

3D), with only few positive scattered cells in the healthy parenchyma.

229
230

Small foci of cells staining positive for viral RNA were observed at a low frequency in

231

the rhesus macaques within the alveolar walls and interalveolar septa of both

232

animals at 4/5 dpc, concomitant with microscopic changes (Figure 3G). IL-6 mRNA

233

was also abundant within the lesions (Figure 3H).

234
235

Changes were less severe in all four animals examined at 14/15 dpc. In the

236

cynomolgus macaques, patchy infiltration of mainly mononuclear cells in the alveolar

237

walls, with occasional similar cells within alveolar spaces, and parenchymal collapse,

238

were seen (Figure 3I). Mononuclear cells, primarily lymphocytes also were noted

239

surrounding and infiltrating the walls of blood vessels and airways (Figure 3J). An

240

increased prominence of bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) was noted. In

241

the lungs of rhesus macaques, changes in the alveoli and BALT were similar in

242

appearance and frequency to those described in the cynomolgus macaques, and

243

perivascular lymphocytic cuffing of small vessels, characterised by concentric

244

infiltrates of mononuclear cells, was also seen occasionally (Figure 3K and 3L).

245

246

Viral RNA was detected in only a few individual cells in both groups of animals at

247

14/15 dpc (Figure 3J, insert; 3L, insert). By day 18/19, the changes were similar but

248

less frequent to those described at day 14/15 in all four animals and viral RNA was

249

not detected by ISH.

250
251

In summary, using the histopathology scoring system developed here, the scores

252

were higher in both macaque species at 4/5 dpc compared to 14/15 and 18/19dpc,

253

mostly due to higher scores in the alveolar damage parameters observed at the early

254

time point (Figure 4A).

255
256

Overall, there was a high presence of viral RNA at 4/5 dpc which was more

257

pronounced in the cynomolgus macaques, in contrast only very few positive cells

258

were observed at 14/15 dpc and none at 18/19 dpc. (Figure 4B). A similar trend was

259

observed in the presence of IL-6 mRNA with a higher amount at 4/5 dpc, which was

260

slightly more pronounced in cynomolgus macaques, and lower expression at 14/15

261

dpc (Figure 4C).

262
263

Viral RNA was observed in scattered epithelial cells in areas of the upper respiratory

264

tract (nasal cavity, larynx and trachea) of all animals at 4/5 dpc, and not associated

265

to any remarkable lesion.

266
267

In the liver, microvesicular, centrilobular vacuolation, consistent with glycogen,

268

together with, small, random, foci of lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration were noted

269

rarely (data not shown). This is considered to represent a mild, frequently observed

270

background lesion. Remarkable changes were not observed in any other tissue. Viral

271

RNA staining was seen only at 4/5 dpc, in occasional, absorbing epithelial and goblet

272

cells in the small and large intestine. It was not observed in any other tissue

273

examined.

274
275

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection

276

Low levels of neutralising antibody were detected by plaque reduction neutralisation

277

test (PRNT) assay in both cynomolgus and rhesus macaques for the first eight to

278

nine days post challenge. From day eleven or twelve, both species showed high

279

neutralising antibody titres which continued at the later time point (14 to 19 dpc). The

280

neutralisation titres at the later time points were generally higher in the cynomolgus

281

macaques, although greater variability in titres between different animals was seen

282

for this species (Figure 5).

283
284

Seroconversion to viral antigens Spike trimer, Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and

285

Nucleoprotein were evaluated by ELISA following infection. Specific antibodies

286

against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in serum collected from both rhesus and

287

cynomolgus macaques from eight to nine dpc onwards (Figure 6).

Frequency of Antigen-Specific IFN-γ Secreting Cells Measured by ELISpot

290

Cellular immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 challenge were measured in

291

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an ex vivo IFN-γ ELISpot assay

292

and compared to responses measured in uninfected (naïve) age and species

matched control animals (Figure 7). Interrogation of IFN-γ spot forming units (SFU)

295

pools indicated that peptides spanning the breadth of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

296

sequence induced cellular immune responses in infected cynomolgus macaques;

297

whereas, peptide pool (PP) sequences 2-4 and 8 were most immunogenic in rhesus

298

macaques (Figure 7A-B).

299
300

In rhesus macaques, the IFN-γ SFU measured following stimulation with spike

301

protein peptide megapools (MP) 1-3 did not differ significantly between animals

302

euthanised at either the day 4-5 (early) or the day 14-19 (late) post-infection time-

303

point in comparison to SFU frequencies measured in the naïve control animals.

304

However, comparison of the summed MP 1-3-specific response indicated that

305

significantly higher SFU frequencies were present in the animals euthanised at the

306

later time-point (P = 0.01) (Figure 7C). By contrast, spike protein MP1-, MP2, and

307

summed MP-specific responses measured in cynomolgus macaques were all

308

(p = 0.03, p = 0.01, p = 0.01) (Figure 7D).

311

In general, there was a trend for spike protein peptide-specific IFN-γ SFU

312

frequencies measured in PBMC samples collected from cynomolgus macaques to

313

be greater than those detected in rhesus macaques, although these differences did

314

not reach statistical significance.

315
316

Spike peptide-specific IFN-γ SFU frequencies measured in mononuclear cells

317

isolated from lung and spleen samples revealed a trend for local cellular immune

responses to be greatest in the animals euthanised at the day 14 to19 post infection

stage of infection (Figure 7E).

321
322

Composition and functional profile of the cell mediated immune response.

323

To explore changes in the composition of the cellular immune compartment following

324

SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunophenotyping flow cytometry assays were applied to

325

PBMCs and lung MNC samples collected at necropsy and from PBMCs collected

326

from age and species matched uninfected (naïve) animals. Comparison of CD4+ and

327

CD8+ T-cell frequencies indicated that the proportion of CD8+ T-cells was greater in

328

cynomolgus macaques prior to, and also after infection when the frequency of the

329

CD4+ subset increased but remained secondary to the CD8+ population in

330

peripheral blood and lung MNC (Figure 7F). Similarly, the frequency of γδ T-cells in

331

peripheral blood was higher in cynomolgus macaques but remained consistent

332

following infection, whereas γδ T-cell frequencies appeared more variable in the lung

333

MNC samples collected from animals euthanised at the early and late post infection

334

time point (Figure 7G-H). Monocyte subtypes were characterised as classical, non-

335

classical or intermediate by expression of CD14+ and CD16+. This revealed an

336

increased frequency of ‘transitional’ CD14+ CD16+ and ‘non-classical’ CD14- CD16+

337

monocyte subsets in PBMCs collected at the later post-infection time point in both

338

rhesus and cynomolgus species. In contrast, the immunomodulatory non-classical

339

monocyte population was more abundant in lung tissue samples collected from

340

rhesus macaques euthanised early after infection in comparison to the later time

341

points or to cynomolgus macaques (Figure 7I). Cytotoxic and immunomodulatory

342

natural killer (NK) cell populations were identified within the CD3-, CD159a+

343

lymphocyte population based on the expression on CD16 and CD56, respectively.

344

Immunomodulatory (CD56+) NK cell populations were detected at higher frequency

345

in the lung and PBMC of infected macaques in comparison to naïve control animals,

346

indicating a potential proinflammatory role for this innate lymphoid cell subset in

347

SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 7J).

348
349

To explore the functional profile of T-cell populations, PBMCs were stimulated with

350

peptide pools spanning the SARS-CoV-2 membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) or spike

351

(S) proteins, and the production of the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17 and GM-

352

CSF along with the activation marker CD69 and degranulation marker CD107a

353

measured by intracellular cytokine staining. Cytokine producing CD4 and CD8 T-

354

cells were detected in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques in response to

355

stimulation with M, N and S peptide pools. Proinflammatory (IFN-γ or GM-CSF

356

producing) T-cells were primarily detected at the later post-challenge time point,

357

although low frequencies of IL-2 producing CD8+ cells were detected in PBMC

358

samples collected from cynomolgus macaques in the early post-challenge samples

359

(Figure 7K). The frequency of Th17 and TNF-α expressing cells differed between the

360

species with IL-17 producing CD4 and CD8 T-cells more prevalent in rhesus

361

macaques, whereas TNFα expression was detected more frequently in cynomolgus

362

macaques. Similarly, cytokine production measured in the γδ T-cell population

363

indicated a trend for greater IL-17 production in PBMCs isolated from rhesus

364

macaques, although low frequencies of IFN-γ and IL-17 producing γδ T-cells were

365

also detected in cynomolgus macaques euthanised at the early post-infection time

366

point indicating that unconventional T-cell populations play a role in the early

367

immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 7L). Peptide-specific expression

368

of the degranulation marker CD107a was assessed as a measure of cell mediated

cytotoxicity. CD107a was detected on CD8 and γδ T-cells in both rhesus and

370

cynomolgus macaques, was most potently induced by stimulation with the M protein

371

peptide pool and detected at higher frequency in cynomolgus macaques at the early

372

373

parameters, antigen-specific expression of the activation marker CD69 was

374

assessed to provide a measure of the overall activation status and SARS-CoV-2

375

antigen-reactogenicity of T-cell subsets following infection. In general, CD69

376

expression on CD4, CD8 and γδ T-cell populations was higher at the later post

377

infection timepoints (Figure 7K-L) and expression levels agreed with the detection of

378

cytokine production in the corresponding T-cell subsets. However, instances of

379

CD69 expression were also apparent in M, N and S peptide stimulated samples, in

380

which there was an absence of cytokine or degranulation marker detection,

381

indicating that these activated cells may have exerted antigen-specific functions

382

outside of the parameters measured by our ICS assay.

385

DISCUSSION

386

We have shown for the first time in a head to head comparison that the

387

consequences of challenge with SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques

388

are similar and in line with outcomes described in studies conducted individually in

389

either, rhesus 11,12,15,16 or cynomolgus macaques 13,17.

390
391

The clinical manifestations in human COVID-19 patients range from asymptomatic to

392

severe

393

characteristic of COVID-19 identified on CT scans in the absence of clinical signs in

394

both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. The lack of clinical signs observed agrees

395

with other reports that used the IN and IT routes of challenge delivery

396

slightly increased levels of clinical changes previously described in rhesus

397

may be due to the use of the ocular and oral routes in addition to IN and IT for

398

challenge and the potential impact of additional in-life sampling. CT provided the only

399

clinical measure that identified abnormalities in vivo consistent with COVID-19 and is

400

therefore a critical tool for evaluation of disease burden following experimental

401

infection. Features characteristic of COVID-19 in human patients, such as ground

402

glass opacity, consolidation and crazy paving were identified on CT scans collected

403

from both SARS-CoV-2 challenged rhesus and cynomolgus macaques in line with

404

reports from studies describing SARS-CoV-2 infection in either, rhesus

405

cynomolgus macaques

410

absence of detection in the blood described across both species is similarly to what

411

is observed in humans with asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 (shedding without clinical

412

signs and/or after resolution of clinical course) and reflect previous reports of SARS-

413

CoV-2 infection in rhesus

414

studies, virus shed from the URT was detected by RT-qPCR very shortly after

415

challenge, which could suggest the presence of residual challenge material rather

416

than shedding of newly replicated virus resulting from infection. However, similar to

417

Rockx et al., 2020, live virus was also detected, albeit at low levels, early after

418

challenge which suggests some level of new virus replication which is also supported

419

by the level of virus detected using RNA probes conducted on samples collected

420

from animals euthanised 4/5 dpc (13).

11,12,15,16

and cynomolgus macaques

13,17

. Similar to these

421
422

Histopathological changes were comparable in both animal species, and closely

423

resembled that seen in human cases following a mild/moderate clinical course.

424

Typical changes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were observed, with

425

DAD and alveolar hyperplasia seen on microscopy together with interstitial lymphoid

426

infiltrates, focally showing perivascular cuffing. These histopathological lesions are

427

compatible to those observed in human patients, although some features seen in

428

humans, such as thromboembolic changes, were not present in the macaques

429

The pathology at 14/15 and 18/19 dpc showed signs of resolution with some focal

430

alveolar hyperplasia. We have described here a histopathology scoring system that

431

allow us to quantify the severity of lesions in the airways and parenchyma of lung

432

tissue sections from SARS-CoV-2 infected macaques. This system might prove to be

433

very useful to compare quantitatively the lung histopathology observed in new

434

vaccine and therapeutic trials.

435

We have also described herein an upregulation of local interleukin-6 production

436

within the pulmonary lesions at the early time points of the infection in both species.

437

The induction of a proinflammatory cytokine storm has been described in human

438

COVID-19 patients, with IL-6 levels significantly elevated and associated with the

439

disease severity 24,25.

440
441

The development of neutralising titres of specific antibodies is important for the

442

control of infection and viral transmission and is a commonly reported feature in

443

COVID-19 patients, although neutralising antibody alone is not considered sufficient

444

for protection against severe disease

445

macaque species from days 8-9 post infection and therefore follows a similar kinetic

immunity.

. IgG seroconversion occurred in both

27

, indicating that both species

449
450

In keeping with the generally mild pathology and limited evidence of viral replication

451

or persistence reported in both macaque species, we detected little evidence in

452

cellular immune profiles of the immune dysregulation associated with severe COVID-

453

19 disease in humans 28. Immunological features were more typical of those reported

454

in milder infections and convalescent patients and included changes in the frequency

455

of CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations

456

immunomodulatory NK

30

29

as well as increased frequencies of

and monocyte subsets 31.

457
458

The role of T-cells in SARS-CoV-2 immunity is not fully defined, although, it is clear

459

that CD4 and CD8 memory T-cells are present in COVID-19 convalescent patients

infection, that reflect upper and lower respiratory tract infection resulting in a lung

population and enable evaluation of the safety and efficacy of novel and repurposed

interventions against SARS-CoV-2 using endpoints of upper and lower respiratory

485

enable evaluation of the impact of therapies on host mediated pathology associated

486

with high levels of prolonged, pulmonary disease. Given the limitations in

487

reproducing the range of underlying health conditions in humans that link to poorer

488

infection outcomes (e.g. diabetes, obesity and age) in macaques, other strategies of

489

disease enhancement such as challenge, route, dose, strain, or manipulation of the

490

host immunity, will be required.

491
492

The limited supply of rhesus macaques is now impacting on future COVID-19 studies

493

to support the development of vaccines and therapeutic products

494

offered by cynomolgus macaques as an appropriate model will greatly increase the

495

international community’s ability to perform these critical studies in support of pre-

496

clinical evaluation and product licensure. Moreover, cynomolgus macaques with a

497

Mauritian genotype have more restricted genetic variability and more limited and

498

better-defined MHC, providing an advantage in the battle to elucidate correlates of

499

protective immunity. These features have been of particular value in HIV vaccine

and cynomolgus macaques (Mauritian genotype)

METHODS

510
511

Animals

512

Six cynomolgus macaques of Mauritian origin (Macaca fascicularis) and six rhesus

513

macaques of Indian origin (Macaca mulatta) were used in this study. Study groups

514

comprised three males and three females of each species and all were adults aged 2

515

to 4 years and weighing between 2.89 and 4.85kg at time of challenge. Before the

516

start of the experiment, socially compatible animals were randomly assigned to

517

challenge groups, to minimise bias.

518
519

Animals were housed in compatible social groups, in cages in accordance with the

520

UK Home Office Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Bred,

521

Supplied or Used for Scientific Procedures (2014) and National Committee for

522

Refinement, Reduction and Replacement (NC3Rs) Guidelines on

523

Accommodation, Care and Use, August 2006

524

housed at Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) level two in cages

525

approximately 2.5M high by 4M long by 2M deep, constructed with high level

526

observation balconies and with a floor of deep litter to allow foraging. Following

527

challenge animals were transferred to ACDP Level three and housed in banks of

528

cages of similar construction placed in directional airflow containment systems that

529

allowed group housing and environmental control whilst providing a continuous,

530

standardised inward flow of fully conditioned fresh air identical for all groups.

531

Additional environmental enrichment was afforded by the provision of toys, swings,

532

feeding puzzles and DVDs for visual stimulation. In addition to ad libitum access to

533

water and standard old-world primate pellets, diet was supplemented with a selection

534

of fresh vegetables and fruit. All experimental work was conducted under the

535

authority of a UK Home Office approved project license (PDC57C033) that had been

536

subject to local ethical review at PHE Porton Down by the Animal Welfare and

537

Ethical Review Body (AWERB) and approved as required by the Home Office

538

Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Animals were sedated by intramuscular

539

(IM) injection with ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaset, 100mg/ml, Fort Dodge Animal

540

Health Ltd, Southampton, UK; 10mg/kg) for procedures requiring removal from their

541

housing. None of the animals had been used previously for experimental

542

procedures.

Viruses and Cells.

545

SARS-CoV-2 Victoria/01/202040 was generously provided by The Doherty Institute,

546

Melbourne, Australia at P1 after primary growth in Vero/hSLAM cells and

547

subsequently passaged twice at PHE Porton in Vero/hSLAM cells [ECACC

548

04091501]. Infection of cells was with ~0.0005 MOI of virus and harvested at day 4 by

549

dissociation of the remaining attached cells by gentle rocking with sterile 5 mm

550

borosilicate beads followed by clarification by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 10 mins.

551

Whole genome sequencing was performed, on the P3 challenge stock, using both

552

Nanopore and Illumina as described previously41. Virus titre of the challenge stocks

553

was determined by plaque assay on Vero/E6 cells [ECACC 85020206]. Cell lines

554

were obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC)

555

PHE, Porton Down, UK. Cell cultures were maintained at 37oC in Minimum essential

556

medium (MEM) (Life Technologies, California, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal

557

bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma, Dorset, UK) and 25 mM HEPES (Life Technologies,

558

California, USA). In addition, Vero/hSLAM cultures were supplemented with 0.4

559

mg/ml of geneticin (Invitrogen) to maintain the expression plasmid. Challenge

560

substance dilutions were conducted in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Inoculum (5 x

561

562

total, 0.5 ml per nostril).

563
564

Clinical signs and in-life imaging by computerised tomography

565

Weight and body temperature were monitored daily. Nasal washes, throat and rectal

566

swabs were taken at intervals of three days for each individual, having samples from

567

at least two animals for each species until five dpc. Whole blood and serum were

568

collected at the same time points. Nasal washes were obtained by flushing the nasal

569

cavity with 2 ml PBS. For throat swabs, a flocked swab (MWE Medical Wire,

570

Corsham, UK) was gently stroked across the back of the pharynx in the tonsillar

571

area. Throat and rectal swabs were processed, and aliquots stored in viral transport

572

media (VTM) and AVL buffer (Qiagen, Milton Keynes, UK) at -80oC until assay.

573
574

Animals were monitored multiple times per day for behavioural and clinical changes.

575

Behaviour was evaluated for contra-indicators including depression, withdrawal from

576

the group, aggression, changes in feeding patterns, breathing pattern, respiration

577

rate and cough. Prior to blood sample collection, aerosol challenge and euthanasia,

578

animals were weighed, examined for gross abnormalities and body temperature

579

measured.

580
581

CT scans were performed at 18 dpc from the four remaining animals at this time

582

point. CT imaging was performed on sedated animals using a 16 slice Lightspeed

583

CT scanner (General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) in the prone and

supine position to assist the differentiation of pulmonary changes at the lung bases

585

caused by gravity dependant atelectasis, from ground glass opacity caused by

586

SARS-CoV-2. All axial scans were performed at 120 KVp, with Auto mA (ranging

587

between 10 and 120) and were acquired using a small scan field of view. Rotation

588

speed was 0.8 s. Images were displayed as an 11 cm field of view. To facilitate full

589

examination of the cardiac and pulmonary vasculature, lymph nodes and

590

extrapulmonary tissues, Niopam 300 (Bracco, Milan, Italy), a non-ionic, iodinated

591

contrast medium, was administered intravenously (IV) at 2 ml/kg body weight and

592

scans were collected immediately after injection and ninety seconds from the mid-

593

point of injection. Scans were evaluated by an expert thoracic radiologist, blinded to

594

the animal’s clinical status, for the presence of: disease features characteristic of

595

COVID-19 in humans (ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving,

596

nodules, peri-lobular consolidation; distribution: upper, middle, lower, central 2/3,

597

bronchocentric); pulmonary embolus and the extent of any abnormalities estimated

598

(<25%, 25-50%, 51-75%, 76-100%).

599
600

Post-mortem examination and histopathology

601

Animals were euthanised at 3 different time-points, in groups of four (including one

602

animal from each species and sex) at 4/5, 14/15 and 18/19 dpc.

603
604

Animals were anaesthetised with ketamine (17.9 mg/kg bodyweight) and

605

exsanguination was performed via cardiac puncture, followed by injection of an

606

anaesthetic overdose (sodium pentabarbitone Dolelethal, Vetquinol UK Ltd, 140

607

mg/kg) to ensure euthanasia. Post-mortem examination and sample collection was

608

performed immediately after confirmation of death.

The bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was collected at necropsy from the right

611

lung. The left lung was dissected prior to BAL collection and used for subsequent

612

histopathology and virology procedures. At necropsy nasal washes, throat and rectal

613

swabs, whole blood and serum were taken alongside tissue samples for

614

histopathology.

615
616

Samples from the left cranial and left caudal lung lobe together with spleen, kidney,

617

liver, mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and

618

ileum), large intestine (caecum and colon), encephalon (cerebrum, cerebellum and

619

brainstem), eye, trachea, larynx and nasal cavity, were fixed by immersion in 10%

620

neutral-buffered formalin and processed routinely into paraffin wax. Nasal cavity

621

samples were decalcified using an EDTA-based solution prior to embedding. Four

622

µm sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined

623

microscopically. A lung histopathology scoring system was setup and used to

624

evaluate the severity of the histopathological lesions observed in each animal (Table

625

1), including lesions affecting the airways and the parenchyma. Three tissue sections

626

from each left lung lobe were used to evaluate the lung histopathology.

627
628

In addition, samples were stained using the RNAscope technique to identify the

629

SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA or Interleukin 6 (IL-6) in lung tissue sections. Briefly, tissues

630

were pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide for 10 mins (RT), target retrieval for 15

631

mins (98-102°C) and protease plus for 30 mins (40°C) (Advanced Cell Diagnostics).

634

tissues for two hours at 40°C. In addition, samples were stained using the RNAscope

635

technique to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA. Amplification of the signal was

636

carried out following the RNAscope protocol using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection

637

kit – Red (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Biotechne).

638
639

Digital image analysis was performed in RNAscope labelled slides to ascertain the

640

percentage of stained cells within the lesions, by using the Nikon-NIS-Ar package.

641

The presence of viral RNA by ISH was evaluated using the whole lung tissue section

642

slides. For IL-6 mRNA, the areas of histopathological lesions were selected as

643

regions of interest (ROI) and the positively labelled area (red) was calculated by the

644

software after setting the thresholds.

645
646

Viral load quantification by RT-qPCR

647

RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following

648

manufacturer’s instruction with final elution in 60 µl nuclease free water. Reverse

649

transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed

650

using TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Applied Biosystems™), 2019-

651

nCoV CDC RUO Kit (Integrated DNA Technologies) and 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR

652

System (Applied Biosystems™) as previously described

653

quantified against 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (Integrated DNA Technologies).

654

Positive samples detected below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 20

655

copies/µl were assigned the value of 13 copies/µl, undetected samples were

656

assigned the value of ≤6.2 copies/µl, equivalent to the assays LLOD. For extracted

657

samples this equates to an LLOQ of 8.57x103 copies/ml and LLOD of 2.66x103

658

copies/ml.

An IFNγ ELISpot assay was used to estimate the frequency and IFNγ production

743

capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in PBMCs using a human / simian IFNγ kit

744

(MabTech, Nacka. Sweden), as described previously 46. The cells were assayed at 2

745

x 105 cells per well, unless there were not enough cells, in which case 1 x 105 cells

746

were used. Cells were stimulated overnight with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools and

747

‘megapools’ of the spike protein (Mimotopes, Australia). Ten peptide pools were

748

used, comprising of 15mer peptides, overlapping by 11 amino acids. The three

749

megapools were made up as such: Megapool 1 (MP1) comprised peptide pools 1-3,

750

Megapool 2 (MP2) comprised peptide pools 4-6 and Megapool 3 (MP3) comprised of

751

peptide pools 7-10. All peptides were used at a concentration of 1.7 µg per well.

752

Phorbol 12-myristate (Sigma) (100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (CN Biosciences,
