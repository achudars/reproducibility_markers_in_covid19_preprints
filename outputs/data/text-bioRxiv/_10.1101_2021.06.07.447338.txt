Abstract

A number of RT-qPCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 have been published and are listed by
the WHO as recommended assays. Furthermore, numerous commercial assays with undisclosed
primer and probe sequences are on the market. As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses, the virus
accrues mutations, which in some cases – as seen with the B.1.1.7 variant – can outperform and push
back other strains of SARS-CoV-2. If mutations occur in primer or probe binding sites, this can impact
RT-qPCR results and impede SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Here we tested the effect of primer mismatches
on RT-qPCR performance in vitro using synthetic mismatch in vitro transcripts. The effects of the
mismatches ranged from a shift in ct values from -0.13 to +7.61. Crucially, we found that a mismatch
in the forward primer has a more detrimental effect for PCR performance than a mismatch in the
reverse primer. Furthermore, we compared the performance of the original Charité RdRP primer set,
which has several ambiguities, with a primer version without ambiguities and found that without
ambiguities the ct values are ca. 3 ct lower. Finally, we investigated the shift in ct values observed
with the Seegene Allplex kit with the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant and found a three-nucleotide
mismatch in the forward primer of the N target.

1. Introduction

As part of the SARS-CoV-2 response the international scientific community rapidly published a
number of RT-PCR diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. 15 RT-PCR assays of national
reference laboratories are listed by the WHO for SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples (WHO,
2020). Although SARS-CoV-2 has a slower mutation rate than, for example, influenza (ManzanaresMeza and Medina-Contreras, 2020), it nevertheless has accrued mutations in most of the primer and
probe binding sites of globally used PCR assays within a few months of the start of the pandemic.
Aligning 177 genomes collected up to July 2020 from across Brazil with primer sequences of 15 of the
WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 assays revealed that only 3 assays (NIID_2019-nCoV-N, nCoV-IP4 and CNCDC-E) had a perfect match to all 177 genomes (Santos et al., 2020). A similar study using sequence
data from 375 genomes collected around the world up to April 2020 showed that only 2 out of 12
WHO-listed assays had a perfect match to all analyzed genomes (CDC-N1 and Charité RdRP) (Toms et
al., 2020). Depending on location and nature of the mismatches this could have significant effects on
assay performance and negatively impact sensitivity. The possible effect of primer mismatches in
silico has been examined in a number of publications (Bru et al., 2008; Huang et al., 1992; Kwok et
al., 1990; Lefever et al., 2013; Stadhouders et al., 2010). However, in vitro results don’t always agree
with in silico analyses, since various confounding factors can influence the outcome (Lefever et al.,
2013; Mendelman et al., 1990; Stadhouders et al., 2010). Therefore, the aim of this study was to
check the impact of in silico described primer mismatches on the in vitro performance of several of
the WHO-listed SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays. Furthermore, approaching the issue from the other side,
we wanted to investigate the in silico basis of an in vitro observed dropout of a PCR target of a
commercial SARS-CoV-2 assay.

2. Material and Methods

2.1. SARS-CoV-2 strains used in this study
We used extracted RNA from SARS-CoV-2 strain mucIMB-1 to generate the in vitro transcripts of the
mismatch and perfect match templates. mucIMB-1 (EPI_ISL_406862) was isolated in January 2020
from a patient in Bavaria, Germany, and is phylogenetically close to the first published SARS-CoV-2
sequence, Wuhan-Hu1. For investigating the performance of several commercial SARS-CoV-2 PCR kits
with SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7, we used strain mucIMB-CB (EPI_ISL-755639) in comparison with
mucIMB-1. mucIMB-CB was isolated from a patient with a history of travel from the UK in December
2020.
2.2. Selection of primer mismatches
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) provides an online tool “PrimerScan” that regularly
screens all available SARS-CoV-2 genomes published on GISAID for mutations in the primer and probe
binding sites of WHO recommended RT-PCR assays (https://primerscan.ecdc.europa.eu/). The
website also plots the frequency of these mutations over time. Based on this information we chose
several of the most frequent mutations between March and September 2020 for this study. Several
of these mutations have since disappeared again.
2.3. Construction of mismatch templates
In order to generate RNA templates with the required mismatches in the primer binding sites, we
used primers containing the mismatch (or complement base of the mismatch for reverse primers)
(Supplementary table 1) and performed an RT-PCR with SARS-CoV-2 mucIMB-1 strain (which has no
mismatch to any of the PCR assays tested here). For several mismatches we had to relax the

annealing temperature in order to be able to generate a PCR product (Table 1). Both forward and
reverse primers contained a short nonsense sequence 5’ of the primer sequence so as to generate a
PCR product that is slightly longer than the template for the subsequent experiments. The purpose is
to avoid artefacts due to primers binding right at the end of a template. The forward primers carried
the T7 promotor at the 5’ end. We then used in vitro transcription to produce the mismatch
templates. Correct (i.e. no mismatch) templates were produced in the same way.
The detailed protocol is described below.
To generate the DNA templates needed for in vitro transcription PCR was performed on a Thermo™
Scientific Piko™ Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) in 50 μl reactions containing 10 μl 5x QIAGEN OneStep
RT-PCR Buffer, 1.4 µl dNTP Mix (10 mM of each dNTP), 0.6 µl dNTP Mix dUTP Solution (premix of 10
mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP and 20 mM dUTP; Jena Bioscience GmbH, Jena, Germany), 1.5 µl Antarctic
UDG (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 2 µl QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix. 5 µl
(2 x 10e4 copies/µl) SARS-CoV-2 RNA were used as template. The amplification conditions were 50 °C
for 30 min, 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C, 15 sec and assay specific annealing
temperature according to Table 2 for 30 sec and a final elongation at 72 °C for 30 sec. PCR products
were analyzed by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands corresponding to the correct fragment size
were cut out and the DNA extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany). The sequence was confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
RNA templates were produced by in vitro transcription using the MEGAscript T7 Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol including a TURBO DNase
treatment step (15 min at 37°C). The in vitro transcripts (IVTs) were cleaned up using the NucleoSpin
RNA Clean-Up Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions and
subsequently quantified by using a Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). The copy number was calculated using the online NEBio Calculator
(https://nebiocalculator.neb.com/#!/ssrnaamt).
2.4. RT-PCR with correct and mismatch IVTs
Dilution series (triplicates) of in vitro transcripts of the correct and mismatch templates were
amplified by RT-qPCR using the published primers and following the published protocols (ref WHO
and references in Supplementary Table 1). All experiments were done with Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR
reagents (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on a MIC thermocycler (BMS, Brisbane, Australia).

2.5. Detecting SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 with several commercial PCR kits
Extracted RNA of strains mucIMB-1 (wild type SARS-CoV-2) and mucIMB-CB (B.1.1.7 variant) was
used with i) the Seegene Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) and run on
a Biorad CFX96DX cycler (Hercules, CA, USA), ii) the VitaPCR SARS-CoV-2 assay (Credo Diagnostics,
Singapore) and iii) the GeneXpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Each assay
was performed according to the respective manufacturer’s instructions.
2.6. Datamining
We downloaded a total of 600,443 sequences and their corresponding metadata from GISAID at
2021-02-24 10:05. Then we used the search_oligodb command from usearch (Edgar, 2010) to
search for the non-degenerated primer sequences (see tables 2a, 3a, 4a) in every SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence with a maximum divergence of three (parameter: -maxdiffs 3). The result sets

were enriched with the corresponding pangolin lineage (Rambaut et al., 2020) obtained from the
metadata.tsv and statistics were generated using csvtk (Shen, 2021). For some strains, no
pangolin lineage was provided with the metadata.tsv. In such case, we classified the strains using
pangolin client v2.3 (O’Toole et al., 2021).

3. Results

3.1. Mismatches in WHO-listed primers

Based on the ECDC PrimerScan tool (https://primerscan.ecdc.europa.eu) we chose 14 mismatches in
primer binding sites of six different WHO-listed RT- qPCR assays. We generated in vitro transcripts of
the mismatch templates and then performed RT-qPCR with the published primers, comparing the ct
values obtained with the “correct” templates and the “mismatch” templates (Table 1 and Figure 1).
The effect of the mismatch on the ct values ranged from -0.13 to +7.61. Within a dilution series
ranging from 10e5 copies/reaction to 10e0 copies/reaction the observed shift in ct values between
the correct and the mismatch template was consistent across all dilutions, i.e. independent of the
template concentration. Regarding the distance of the mismatch from the 3’ end of the primer and
the magnitude of the ct shift, there was only a weak correlation (Pearson -0.320) for the entire
dataset. However, when analyzing forward and reverse primer separately, we found a strong
negative correlation for mismatches in the forward primer (Pearson -0.822) and no correlation for
the reverse primer (Pearson 0.004). Analyzing the data from a recent study on primer mismatches in
SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assays (Nakabayashi et al., 2021) under this aspect, we found the same trend,
i.e. a strong negative correlation between the distance of the mismatch from the 3’ end and the
magnitude of the ct shift for the forward primer (Pearson -0.576) and only a weak correlation for the
reverse primer (Pearson -0.159).
With regard to the mismatch type, there was no consistent pattern. A G:T mismatch is thought to be
generally well tolerated in PCR (Kwok et al., 1990; Rejali et al., 2018; Stadhouders et al., 2010).
However, in our study a G:T mismatch resulted in a large delta ct of 6.79 at a distance of 10 bases
from the 3’ end (CDC-N1-MM R15) in one instance and a delta ct of only 2.3 at a distance of 2 bases
from the 3’ end (IP2-MM R17) in another instance.

3.2. Charité RdRP primer set

The original Charité primer set for RdRP (Corman et al., 2020) carries three ambiguous positions, one
in the forward primer (position 5) and two in the reverse primer (positions 3 and 12 (Supplementary
table 1). We conducted an in silico analysis of the primer binding sites using > 600,000 SARS-CoV-2
genomes published on GISAID (as of February 2021). 99.40 % of genomes carry an A at position 5 in
the forward primer and 99.97 % carry a T (i.e. an A in the primer) at both positions 3 and 12 of the
reverse primer (Tables 2a and 3a). We therefore used primers with the dominant sequence
(designated RdRP-SARSr-F2.new and RdRP-SARSr.R1.new) and compared their performance to
primers containing the ambiguities. Both the correct template as well as a template including a
mismatch in the binding site of the forward primer, RdRP MM F8, yielded PCR products with lower ct
values (-3.16 for correct template, -3.60 for MM F8) with the .new primers compared to the original
Charité primers (Fig. 1a). In both primer sets (Charité and .new) the difference in ct values between
the correct template and mismatch template was negligible (Table 1), indicating that the mismatch
has no pronounced effect on amplification.

Further in silico analysis showed that for the reverse primer sequence only 23 respectively 15 out of
600,443 SARS-CoV-2 genomes carry a mismatch to the .new primer sequence in positions 3
respectively 12. The mismatches are spread over eight (position 3) and nine (position 12) lineages
with no clear cluster in any one lineage (Table 3b). No genome carries both mismatches at the same
time. For the forward primer 44 genomes carry a C and 36 a G at position 5 of the primer. The C
mismatch only appears in lineage B.1.177 (0.052 % of B.1.177 genomes), while the G mismatch is
spread over 9 lineages. A more dominant mismatch is the mismatch in position 8 of the forward
primer, mentioned above. This mismatch was investigated in vitro, as 2,050 genomes carried a T,
instead of a G (0.34 % of all genomes). This appears in 41 different lineages and is dominant (i.e.
present in > 98 % of genomes) in 5 lineages (Table 2b).

3.3. SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 amplified with several commercial PCR assays

We amplified RNA from wild type SARS-CoV-2 and variant B.1.1.7 with the GeneXpert Xpress SARSCoV-2 assay, Vita PCR SARS-CoV-2 assay and Seegene Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FLuB/RSV assay.
According to the manufacturers, GeneXpert targets the N and E gene, VitaPCR has two N gene
targets and Seegene has targets in the RdRP, S and N gene. Neither GeneXpert nor VitaPCR showed
any difference in ct values between wild type and B.1.1.7 (data not shown). The Seegene assay,
however, showed a drop in ct values of 7.2 ct in the N target, but not in the S or RdRP target. The
drop in ct values was consistent across template concentrations between 10 and 10e5
copies/reaction and led to a loss of sensitivity of 2 log for the N target (Fig 2). We cloned and
sequenced the PCR product to identify the mismatch causing the drop in PCR performance. Aligning
the PCR amplicon to SARS-CoV-2 WuhanHu1 and B.1.1.7 revealed a triple mismatch in the forward
primer (GAT => CTA), corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 genome positions 28,280-28,282 at the start of
the N gene (Fig. 3). This mismatch currently (as of February 2021) has an overall frequency of 16.55 %
in 600,000 genomes on gisaid.org and appears in 98.74 % of all B.1.1.7 genomes (UK variant) and
57.23 % of all B.1.214 genomes (DRC variant) as well as three further lineages with < 1 % frequency
(Table 4).

4. Discussion

4.1. Effect of primer mismatches

Several factors can influence the impact of a mismatch on PCR amplification. One intuitive and well
documented factor is the proximity of the mismatch to the 3’ end of the primer (Bru et al., 2008;
Kwok et al., 1990; Stadhouders et al., 2010). Interestingly, in our study this correlation was not
obvious when looking at the whole dataset, but was only true for mismatches in the forward primers.
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, which means that in an RT-PCR reaction,
the first step, the reverse transcription, involves the binding of the reverse primer to the sense RNA
strand. The forward primer is only used during the subsequent PCR step. Studies from the early days
of PCR noted that reverse transcriptases are more tolerant towards mismatches than DNA
polymerases (Huang et al., 1992; Mendelman et al., 1990). Therefore, in an RT-PCR reaction, the
reverse transcriptase is more likely to be able to create a cDNA strand from a mismatched primer,
correcting the mismatch in the process, while the Taq polymerase is more discriminant against
mismatches, resulting in decreased amplification. Thus, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, a mismatch in the
forward primer should have a stronger negative impact than in the reverse primer. Our data confirms
this, albeit with a limited number of data points. For SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays, this hypothesis is
also supported by data from Nakabayashi et al. (Nakabayashi et al., 2021). In an earlier study using
HIV-RT-PCR assays, Stadhouders et al. (Stadhouders et al., 2010) made a similar observation. They
also noted that when using rTth polymerase (an enzyme that has both reverse transcription and DNA
polymerase functionality) instead of a combination of MMLV reverse transcriptase and Taq
polymerase for the RT-PCR reaction, mismatches in the forward primer had almost no effect, but
mismatches in the reverse primer had a detrimental effect. The authors hypothesize that the
different incubation temperatures of MMLV and rTth of 60 °C and 48 °C as well as differences in ionic
strength of the reaction buffers contribute to this phenomenon. The varying influence of different
PCR reagents on mismatches was also observed by Levefer et al. (Lefever et al., 2013).
Another factor impacting PCR amplification is the mismatch type. A transversion, i.e. resulting in a
mispairing of two pyrimidines (C:C, T:T, C:T, T:C) or two purines (A:A, G:G, A:G, GA) is thought to have
a greater impact than a transition, i.e. resulting in a mispairing of a pyrimidine and a purine (A:C, C:A,
T:G, G:T), mainly due to sterical reasons (Huang et al., 1992; Rejali et al., 2018; Stadhouders et al.,
2010). This trend is not obvious in our dataset, particularly illustrated by the example of a G:T
mismatch, which had a small effect in close proximity to the 3’ end but a rather large effect further
away. A recent study on primer mismatches in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays has shown the effect from
a transition mismatch type in the ultimate 3’ position of a primer to result in a shift in ct values
ranging from 0.51 to 6.29 up to a complete PCR failure (Nakabayashi et al., 2021). Taken together,
this indicates that not only the mismatch type and position, but also the surrounding sequence of the
template and primer influence the outcome, presumably due to secondary structures and
interactions based on these (Mendelman et al., 1990; Rejali et al., 2018). Consequently, this serves as
a warning that in silico analysis of the effect of primer mismatches can only give an estimate on the
impact on PCR performance and should always be tested in vitro.

4.2. RdRP primers

The Charité RdRP assay (Corman et al., 2020) was published on 23 Jan 2020, when only the original
Wuhan-Hu1 sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was available as a reference. Based on alignments with human
SARS-CoV-1 and bat-related SARS-CoV several ambiguities were introduced in the primer sequences.
Particularly the base at position 12 from the 5’ end of the reverse primer has sparked some
th

discussion since. Corman et al. inserted an S (= C or G) at this position. Pillonel (Pillonel et al., 2020),
after noticing a poorer performance of the RdRP assay compared to the E assay and comparing 1623
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available by May 2020, suggested using an R (= A or G), while the
ECDC PrimerScan website lists an ECDC-corrected version of the primer with a W (= A or T). Vogels
(Vogels, 2020) also noted the poor performance of the RdRP assay and stated that 990 of 992
genomes available at the time carried a T at position 12 of the reverse primer. More than a year into
the pandemic and with over 600,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced it turns out that 99.97 % carry
a T at position 12 as well as position 3, where the Charité reverse primer has the second ambiguity.
Since the use of ambiguous primer sequences essentially reduces the amount of “correct” primer for
the template (with two ambiguities in the reverse primer, R and S, this results in four primer variants,
i.e. only 25 % of the reverse primers in the PCR reaction have the correct sequence) this would
account for the poor performance of the primer. Using the primer without ambiguities, with A (to
complement the T on the template) in positions 3 and 12 improves the sensitivity of the assay by
about 1 log.
For the forward primer the situation is more complex. Only a minute fraction of genomes (0.01 %)
carry a G instead of an A at position 5, which would be covered by the ambiguity in the Charité
primer sequence. However, we discovered another mismatch in position 8 which, although only
present in 0.34 % of the total genome dataset, is the dominant variant in several smaller lineages.
This highlights the problem that primer mismatches in localized outbreaks may go unnoticed, while
still causing problems with diagnostic assays locally.

4.3. Commercial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays

The 7.2 ct loss in the N target of the Seegene Allplex assay we observed with the B.1.1.7 variant
exemplifies the problem with commercial SARS-CoV-2 PCR assays. With proprietary primer and probe
sequences the users cannot (or only with considerable effort) check for themselves whether new
SARS-CoV-2 variants affect the performance of the assay. They have to rely on communication of
manufacturers or serendipitous findings. Other examples of PCR failures with commercial assays
were described by Ziegler et al (Ziegler et al., 2020), who found a drop out of the N target in
GeneXpert (Cepheid) in one patient sample. Analysis of the sequence revealed a point mutation in
the N gene and comparison with GISAID data showed a frequency of 0.2 % for that SNP.
Furthermore, Artesi et al. (Artesi et al., 2020) noted a drop out of the E gene target in the Cobas
system (Roche) in 0.2 % of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from Belgian healthcare workers in
March/April 2020. The identified SNP at position 26,340 in the E gene was present in just 0.09 % of
global SARS-CoV-2 genomes on GISAID. This reiterates the problem pointed out in the last paragraph
– not all mutations are as successful as B.1.1.7 and many appear only within a limited geographical
region. Another example is a cluster of SNPs in the N gene found in Madeira County, California, USA,
that resulted in a loss of 5.4 ct in the Japan N assay NIID_2019-nCoV (Vanaerschot et al., 2021). These
regionally restricted mutations may also disappear over time, but while they exist, they can impede
diagnostics. This is particularly problematic in countries that do not have the capacity to retest
samples with multiple assays or follow up suspicious samples with whole genome sequencing.
On the other hand, a drop out of a PCR target can also be used to screen for a certain mutation,
provided that at least a second target is used to confirm SARS-CoV-2. An example is the drop out of
the S gene target in the Thermo Fisher TaqPath assay, which is widely used across the UK. It guided
and supported the genome sequencing effort that documented the fast spread of variant B.1.1.7 in
Britain (Chand et al., 2020).

4.5. Conclusions

This in vitro study provides data for the effect of primer mismatches on PCR performance. It
highlights the fact that experimental data does not necessarily follow the theoretical predictions,
particularly with regard to the magnitude of the ct shift with mismatches close to the 3’ end. This
emphasizes the importance of using more than one target in a diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (or any
other diagnostic PCR for that matter) to counteract PCR dropouts due to mutations. With several
targets a PCR drop out or relative shift in ct values compared to the other targets used can actually
serve as an indication for a mutation, prompting further investigation of the sample by genome
sequencing. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance to remain vigilant with regard to new
mutations and their potential effect on PCR performance. In this context it is also important to keep
in mind the underrepresentation of genome data from some geographical regions (e.g. Africa), which
may lead to mutations from these regions being overlooked, despite causing problems in diagnostics
in these regions.
