Abstract
A worldwide effort to counter the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in hundreds of candidate
vaccines moving through various stages of research and development, including several vaccines
in phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials. A relatively small number of these vaccines have been
evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 disease models, and fewer in a severe disease model. Here, a SARSCoV-2 DNA targeting the spike protein and delivered by jet injection, nCoV-S(JET), elicited
neutralizing antibodies in hamsters and was protective in both wild-type and transiently
immunosuppressed hamster models. This study highlights the DNA vaccine, nCoV-S(JET), we
developed has a great potential to move to next stage of preclinical studies, and it also
demonstrates that the transiently-immunosuppressed Syrian hamsters, which recapitulate severe
and prolonged COVID-19 disease, can be used for preclinical evaluation of the protective
efficacy of spike-based COVID-19 vaccine.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid development of candidate vaccines and
treatments targeting the SARS-CoV-2. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in either
asymptomatic infection or disease ranging from mild to severe respiratory symptoms 1. Many
factors contribute to the spread of this virus, including a large number of asymptomatic cases 2
and transmission prior to the onset of symptoms 3. An effective vaccine would be an invaluable
medical countermeasure to protect individuals, prevent transmission, and contribute to
containing and ultimately ending this pandemic.
According to the World Health Organization, as of 30 September 2020, there were 41 SARSCoV-2 vaccines in clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) and 151 vaccines in preclinical
development 4. Of these vaccines in preclinical development several have been tested for
immunogenicity in mice and nonhuman primates. Few have been tested in disease models such
as the Syrian hamster model. The Syrian hamster has become a leading animal model for SARSCoV-2 medical countermeasure testing because it does not require a modified virus, or animal,
and there are several similarities to human COVID-19 disease including rapid breathing,
lethargy, ruffled fur and moderate (<10%) weight loss 5 6. Histopathology includes areas of lung
consolidation, followed by pneumocyte hyperplasia as the virus is cleared. At least three
candidate vaccines have been tested for efficacy in the Syrian hamster model 7-9.
We have developed a Syrian hamster model of severe COVID-19 disease by using
cyclophosphamide (CyP) to transiently immunosuppress the hamsters 10. In this model,
lymphopenia is induced by CyP treatment starting 3 days before exposure to virus. After a
relatively low dose of virus (1,000 PFU), the immunosuppressed hamsters develop a protracted
disease with >15% weight loss over several days and other indicators of severe disease including

high levels of virus in the lungs. Herein, we describe the testing of a jet-injected SARS-CoV-2
DNA vaccine in both wild-type and transiently-immunosuppressed hamsters. Hantavirus DNA
vaccines administered at a dosage of 0.2 mg are highly immunogenic in hamsters when
administered using jet injection 11. Therefore, as an initial proof-of-concept, we opted to use the
0.2 mg dose.
Results
Evaluation of DNA vaccine in wild-type hamster model of COVID-19 disease
A SARS-CoV-2 spike-based DNA vaccine, nCoV-S(JET), was constructed by cloning a humancodon-optimized gene encoding the full-length spike protein into a plasmid vector as described
in Methods. The plasmid backbone used for this vaccine, pWRG, has been used for hantavirus
DNA vaccines that are currently in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials 12. Expression of the spike
protein from the nCoV-S(JET) was confirmed to express in cell culture (Suppl. Fig. S1). In the
first vaccine efficacy experiment, groups of 8 hamsters were vaccinated on week 0 and 3 with
either 0.2 mg nCoV-S(JET), or 0.2 mg of a MERS-CoV DNA vaccine, or PBS using jet injection
(Fig. 1A). Sera were collected after 1 vaccination (Wk 3) or 2 vaccinations (Wk 5) and
evaluated in a SARS-CoV-2 plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and pseudovirion
neutralization assay (PsVNA). SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were detected in all of the
animals by both assays after the boost (p=0.0156 (PRNT50), p=0.0078 (PsVNA50), Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed rank test, Fig. 1B; PRNT80 and PsVNA80 titers shown in Suppl. Fig.
2A,B). Results from the PRNT and PsVNA were acceptably similar (Suppl. Fig. 3). The
MERS DNA vaccine did not elicit SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralizing antibodies as measured by
PRNT or PsVNA, but all of animals vaccinate with that vaccine developed MERS virus
neutralizing antibodies as measured by PsVNA (Suppl. Fig. 4).

Three weeks after the boost all of the hamsters were exposed to 100,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2 by
the intranasal route (Day 0). Daily weight change data demonstrated that animals vaccinated with
nCoV-S(JET) lost significantly less weight than the animals vaccinated with PBS on Day 4
(p=0.0044, Kruskal-Wallis test, Fig. 1C). In contrast, animals vaccinated with the MERS-CoV
DNA vaccine were not protected from weight loss. No significant changes in viral RNA load
from pharyngeal swabs between nCoV-S(JET)-vaccinated and PBS animals were observed at
any timepoint (Fig. 1D). Animals were euthanized 5 days after virus exposure and lung
homogenates were assayed for viral RNA and infectious virus. There were significant reductions
in viral RNA (p=0.0003 vs. MERS-CoV, p=0.0060 vs. PBS, Kruskal-Wallis test with multiple
comparisons, Fig. 1E) and infectious virus (p=0.0968 vs. MERS-CoV, p=0.0114 vs. PBS,
Kruskal-Wallis test with multiple comparisons, Fig. 1F) in the hamsters vaccinated with nCoVS(JET) DNA when compared to the animals vaccinated with MERS-CoV DNA or PBS. Bright
field imagery of lung H&E sections show extensive areas of consolidation in PBS- and MERSCoV-vaccinated hamsters that are not present in nCoV-S(JET)-vaccinated hamsters (Fig.
1G,H,I). Multifocal and scattered positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA labeling in areas of inflammation
and respiratory epithelial cells is detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) in PBS and MERS-CoV
vaccinated hamsters that are not present in nCoV-S(JET) vaccinated hamsters (Fig. 1J,K,L).
Together, these data indicate the nCoV-S(JET) vaccine had a protective effect in the Syrian
hamster model.
Evaluation of DNA vaccine in an immunosuppressed hamster model of severe COVID-19
disease
In a second vaccine efficacy experiment, groups of 8 hamsters were vaccinated on week 0 and 3
with 0.2 mg of nCoV-S(JET) or PBS in a 0.1 mL volume using jet injection (Fig. 2A). Sera

were collected after 1 vaccination (Wk 3) or 2 vaccinations (Wk 5) and evaluated in a SARSCoV-2 PRNT and PsVNA (p=0.0078 (PRNT50), p=0.0234 (PsVNA50), Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test, Fig. 2B). Correlation of neutralization assays is shown in Suppl. Fig. 3.
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all of the animals by both assays after the boost (Fig.
2B). In contrast, hamsters vaccinated with PBS had undetectable neutralizing antibodies in both
assays. Previously we demonstrated that transient immunosuppression using CyP results in a
severe disease model in Syrian hamsters 10. Here, hamsters were treated with CyP on Day -3, 1,
5, and 9 relative to challenge. On Day 0 prior to challenge, hamsters were bled for hematology to
confirm lymphopenia (Fig. 2C). Hamsters were then exposed to 1,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2 by the
intranasal route (Day 0). Starting on Day 4 post-infection and continuing through the rest of the
experiment, significant differences in weight were observed between hamsters vaccinated with
nCoV-S(JET) DNA versus PBS (Day 4, p=0.0059, Days 5-13, p<0.001, t-test, Fig. 2D). nCoVS(JET) DNA-vaccinated hamsters had significantly less viral RNA load in pharyngeal swabs on
Day 9 (p=0.0286, t-test, Fig. 2E) and trending lower on Days 7 and 11. On Day 13 post-infection
(termination of experiment), significant reductions in viral RNA (p=0.0006, t-test, Fig. 2F) and
infectious virus (p=0.0014, t-test, Fig. 2G) in the lungs were measured between the nCoVS(JET) DNA vaccine and PBS groups. Similar pathology was noted in the transiently
immunosuppressed hamsters compared to wild-type animals shown in Figure 1, with extensive
areas of consolidation observed by H&E and multifocal and scattered positive SARS-CoV-2
RNA labeling in areas of inflammation and respiratory epithelial cells by ISH (Fig. 2H,I).
Noteworthy, these lungs were collected on Day 13 whereas those collected in the experiment
with wild-type hamsters were collected on Day 5. Together, these data indicate the nCoV-S(JET)
vaccine had a protective effect in a SARS-CoV-2 infection model with severe and prolonged

Unprotected animals lost >15% of their weight and still harbored infectious virus in their lungs
almost two weeks after exposure.
Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine to
prevent this disease. Nearly every conceivable vaccine platform has been brought to bear on the
problem including both RNA- and DNA-based vaccines. Nucleic acid vaccines can be produced
rapidly once a target immunogen sequence is known and can be modified rapidly if changes in
the sequence become necessary; however, delivering the nucleic acid to cells for immunogen
expression remains a technical challenge. For RNA vaccines, efficient vaccine delivery requires
formulation with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) or other modalities to protect the RNA and get it
across cell membranes. The safety and efficacy of LNP-formulated RNA is currently being
assesses in multiple COVID vaccine trials (Clinicaltrials.gov). DNA delivered by needle and
syringe can be immunogenic without LNP formulation, even in nonhuman primates 13; however,
the use of other techniques such as electroporation or jet injection can increase immunogenicity
while reducing dosing requirements. At least one COVID-19 DNA vaccine delivered by
electroporation (Inovio) has advanced into the clinic (Clinicaltrials.gov).
To our knowledge, there are no reports of a COVID-19 DNA delivered by jet injection
advancing into the clinical- or even progressed to animal efficacy testing. This is surprising
because of the logistical and regulatory advantages of disposable syringe jet injection over
electroporation. There are several contract manufacturing organizations around the world
capable of rapidly producing GMP plasmid for use in humans. Thus, the drug substance could be
produced rapidly and the safety profile for DNA vaccines has been established over decades. The

drug product delivery system, disposable syringe jet injection, such as PharmaJet’s Stratis, is
U.S. FDA 510(k)-cleared and has CE Mark and WHO PQA certification. Disadvantages of the
DNA vaccine is that at least one booster vaccination, and possibly two in humans, would likely
be needed and the dosage would be milligrams rather than micrograms, as is the case for LNPformulated mRNA vaccines.
There are a limited number of published reports of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy testing in animal
models of COVID-19 disease. These include the testing of self-amplify mRNA in the K18hACE2 mouse model 14, a VSV-vectored vaccine in the hACE2 transduced mouse model 15, and
at least four virus-vectored (yellow fever, adenovirus, VSV, and inactivated Newcastle disease
virus) vaccines in SARS-CoV-2 adapted mouse and/or the Syrian hamster model 7,9,16,17. In all
of the aforementioned efficacy experiments, the vaccines were based on the full-length spike
protein and neutralizing antibodies were predictive of protection. Here we used a used a jet
injection technique to deliver a SARS2 spike-based DNA vaccine to Syrian hamsters. Jet
injection technology is not widely available for small animal use. We used a human intradermal
jet injection technology to deliver vaccines intramuscularly to the hamsters. We had previously
demonstrated approximately 300-fold increases in neutralizing antibodies when this jet injection
technique was used relative to a needle and syringe in hamsters vaccinated with hantavirus DNA
vaccines 11.
The immunogenicity parameter we focused on was neutralizing antibody. We measured
neutralizing antibodies against live virus by PRNT and a non-replicating VSV-based PsVNA.
These assays showed significant correlation (p< 0.0001) (Suppl. Fig 3A,B). The neutralizing
antibody levels rose significantly after the booster vaccination reaching a PRNT80 geometric
mean titer (GMT) of 207 and PRNT50 GMT of 761 that are comparable or exceeding titers of

other DNA vaccines evaluated in nonhuman primates 13 and mice 18. The PRNT50=761 is
similar to the 50% titers elicited in hamsters vaccinated with single-dose, live-virus vectored
vaccines: Ad26-vectored vaccine PsVNA50 <1000; VSV-vectored vaccine PRNT50 <1000, and
Yellow Fever-vectored vaccine PRNT50 <1000 7-9. Neutralization titer was plotted against viral
RNA detected in lung tissue collected at the time of euthanasia. Negative correlation was
observed (Suppl. Fig. 5); however, this did not reach statistical significance. There was no crossneutralizing antibodies against MERS pseudovirions, and those animals were not protected from
disease in the hamster model.
Our results in the transiently-immunosuppressed hamster model add extra credence to the idea
that antibodies are playing an important role in the protection observed. The transientimmunosuppressed hamster model is a low-dose (1,000 PFU), severe disease model. CyP
treatment, renders B and T cells non-functional, essentially replicating an antibody passive
transfer experiment where, rather than the passive transfer of exogenous antibody, the vaccinegenerated antibody circulating in the animal prior to CyP treatment must be sufficient to protect
against disease. If a candidate vaccine where to protect in the wild-type hamster model but not in
the transiently-immunosuppressed hamster model, then that would indicate that T and/or B cell
proliferation is required for protection afforded by that vaccine. In the case of the nCoV-S(JET)
DNA vaccine, normal T and/or B cell proliferation at the time of exposure was not necessary for
the protective effect.
This study shows that a relatively simple unmodified full-length S DNA vaccine administered by
a relatively simple jet injection technique can elicit neutralizing antibodies after a single
vaccination, PRNT50 titers > 700 after a booster, and protect in two hamster models of disease
caused by SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine-mediated protection in the transiently-immunosuppressed

against SARS-CoV-2.
Materials and Methods
Ethics. Animal research was conducted under an IACUC approved protocol at USAMRIID
(USDA Registration Number 51-F-00211728 & OLAW Assurance Number A3473-01) in
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations relating to
animals and experiments involving animals. The facility where this research was conducted is
fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care, International and adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011.
Plasmid construction. For both pWRG/nCoV-S(opt) and pWRG/MERS-S(opt), the full-length
S gene open reading frame, preceded at the N-terminus by Kozak sequence (ggcacc), was human
codon usage-optimized and synthesized by Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ) and cloned into the
BglII-NotI site of DNA vaccine vector pWRG. The SARS-nCoV-2 S sequence used was the
Wuhan coronavirus 2019 nCoV S gene open reading frame (Genebank accession QHD43416).
The MERS sequence used was nc Jordan-N3/2012 S gene open reading frame (Genebank
accession AGH58717.1). The plasmids for use in vaccinations were produced commercially and
diluted in PBS to 2 mg/mL (Aldevron, Fargo ND). Expression of the spike protein from
pWRG/nCoV-S(opt) was confirmed by transfection of 293T cells followed by
immunofluoresence antibody test (IFAT) using heat inactivated (56°C 30 min) human
convalescent plasma NRS-53265 (ATCC, Manassa, VA) and compared to empty vector (Suppl.
Fig. 1). A second plasmid for the PsVNA was constructed by deletion of 21 amino acids from
the COOH terminus of the full length plasmid, pWRG/CoV-S(opt)∆21 for better incorporation in

to pseudovirions 19. The pWRG/nCoV-S(opt) plasmid is also called nCoV-S(JET) when
combined with jet injection.
Animal Vaccinations. Wild type (females only, aged 6-8 weeks) hamsters (Mesocricetus
auratus) were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized isoflurane using an IMPAC6 veterinary
anesthesia machine. Fur over the semitendinosus and biceps femoris muscles (right leg) were
removed using electric clippers. The PharmaJet® Tropis device was used to deliver 0.2 mg of
DNA in a 0.1 mL volume intramuscularly 11. Specifically, the disposable syringe of the device
was pressed against the skin, and the device was activated resulting in the delivery of a liquid jet
into the muscle and overlying tissues.
Other Animal Procedures. In addition to vaccination, the following procedures were conducted
after anesthetizing the hamsters as described above: intranasal challenge of virus,
cyclophosphamide (CyP) intraperitoneal injections, pharyngeal swabs, and non-terminal blood
collection. Intranasal instillation of SARS-CoV-2 was administered in a volume of 50µl for the
challenge doses of 1,000 PFU, and 100µl for the challenge dose of 100,000 PFU. CyP treatment
(Baxter, pharmaceutical grade) consisted of an initial loading dose of 140mg/kg on Day -3,
followed by maintenance doses of 100mg/kg on Days 1, 5, and 9 post-exposure. Pharyngeal
swabs in 0.5ml of complete media were used for virus detection to monitor infection and disease
course in hamsters. Vena cava blood collection was limited to 7% of total blood volume per
week. Terminal blood collection was performed by cardiac injection at the time of euthanasia.
All work involving infected animals was performed in an animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3)
laboratory.
SARS-CoV-2 stock. An aliquot of the third passage of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA-1/2020 was
received from the CDC and propagated in ATCC Vero 76 cells (99% confluent) in EMEM

containing 1% GlutaMAX, 1% NEAA, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at an MOI
of 0.01. Supernatant was collected from cultures exhibiting characteristic CPE and clarified by
centrifugation (10,000 g x 10 minutes). Clarified virus was subjected to the following
specifications: Identification by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay, Quantification by agarose-based
plaque assay, free from contaminants by growth of chocolate agar plates, endotoxin testing using
Endosafe® nexgen-PTS, and mycoplasma using MycoAlert test kit, and genomic sequencing.
For experiments with a challenge dose of ≤10,000 PFU, virus passage 5 was used; for
experiments with a challenge dose of 100,000 PFU, passage 6 was used. Genomic analysis
indicates no changes between passage 3, 5, and 6 lots.
Viral RNA assay. Following 3 freeze/thaws of frozen swabs in media, 250µl of media was
removed and added to 750µl of Trizol LS. Approximately 200mg of organ tissue was
homogenized in 1.0ml of Trizol using M tubes on the gentleMACS dissociator system on the
RNA setting. RNA was extracted from Trizol LS or Trizol per manufacturer’s protocol. A
Nanodrop 8000 was used to determine RNA concentration, which was then raised to 100ng/µl in
UltraPure distilled water. Samples were run in duplicate on a BioRad CFX thermal cycler using
TaqPath 1-step RT-qPCR master mix according to the CDC’s recommended protocol of 25°C
for 2 minutes, 50°C for 15 minutes, 95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of , 95°C for 3
seconds and 55°C for 30 seconds. The forward and reverse primer and probe sequences are:
2019-nCoV_N2-F, 5’-TTA CAA ACA TTG GCC GCA AA-3’, 2019-nCoV_N2-R, 5’-GCG
CGA CAT TCC GAA GAA-3’, and 2019-nCoV_N2-P, 5’-ACA ATT TCC CCC AGC GCT

combined with 2-fold serial dilutions of cEMEM containing antibody and incubated at 37°C in a
5% CO2 incubator for 1 hour (total volume 222µl). 180 µl per well of the combined
virus/antibody mixture was then added to 6-well plates containing 3-day old, ATCC Vero 76
monolayers and allowed to adsorb for 1 hour in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator. 3mL per well of
agarose overlay (0.6% SeaKem ME agarose, EBME with HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated FBS,
100X NEAA, 1% Pen/Strep, 0.1% Gentamycin and 0.2% Fungizone) was then added and
allowed to solidify at room temperature. The plates were placed in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for
2 days and then 2mL per well of agarose overlay containing 5% neutral red and 5% heatinactivated FBS is added. After 1 additional day in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, plaques were
visualized and counted on a light box. PRNT50 and PRNT80 titers are the reciprocal of the
highest dilution that results in an 50% and 80% reduction in the number of plaques relative to the
number of plaques visualized in the cEMEM alone (no antibody) wells.
Pseudovirion Neutralization Assay (PsVNA)
The PsVNA used to detect neutralizing antibodies in sera utilized a non-replicating vesicular
stomatitis (VSV)-based luciferase expressing system described previously 20. For the MERS
PsVNA there were no modifications, for SARS-CoV-2 assays there were two modifications: 1)
no complement was used to parallel the SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, 2) a monoclonal anti-VSV-G
(IE9F9) was added at 100ng/ml to eliminate any residual VSV activity in the pseudotype
preparation. PsVNA50 and PsVNA80 titers were interpolated from 4-parameter curves, and
GMTs were calculated.
Pseudovirion Production
Pseudovirions were produced using the pWRG/CoV-S(opt)Δ21 or MERS-CoV plasmid
described above. HEK293T cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture flasks to be ∼80% confluent

the following day and were transfected with the plasmid of interest using Fugene 6 (Promega).
After ∼18 h the transfection media was removed and the cells were infected with VSVΔG∗rLuc
at a multiplicity of infection of ∼0.07 for 1 h at 37°C. The media was removed and fresh media

was added, the flasks were then incubated at 32°C for 72 h. The supernatant from infected cells
was collected and clarified by high speed centrifugation, followed by a PEG 8,000 precipitation
with 3.2% salt. The PEG mixture is spun at10K xG for 45 min. The pellet was resuspended
overnight in 1 mL TNE buffer, then filtered using a 0.45 μm filter, aliquoted and stored at -70°C.
Plaque Assay. Approximately 200mg of lung tissue was homogenized in 1.0mL of cEMEM
using a gentleMACS M tubes and a gentleMACS dissociator on the RNA setting. Tubes were
centrifuged to pellet debris and supernatants collected. Ten-fold dilutions of the samples were
adsorbed to Vero 76 monolayers (200µl of each dilution per well). Following a 1 hour adsorption
in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, cells were overlaid and stained identically as described for PRNT.
The limit of detection for this assay is 50 plaque forming units (PFU).
Hematology. Whole blood collected in EDTA tubes was analyzed on an HM5 hematology
analyzer on the DOG2 setting.
Preparation of tissues for histology. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin,
trimmed, processed, embedded in paraffin, cut at 5 to 6µm, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E).
Bright Field Imagery. Photographs of the H&E stained slides were taken with a Canon EOS 7D
Mark II (mfr#9128B002AA) and Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L Macro (mfr#3554B002) lens. Slides
were placed on a lightbox and photographed at 1:1 magnification with a shutter speed of
1/100sec, aperture of f8.0, ISO 400 and saved as Canon RAW files. Contrast was adjusted
equally for all images with Photoshop Lightroom and then exported as PNG files.

In situ hybridization. To detect SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA in FFPE tissues, in situ
hybridization (ISH) was performed using the RNAscope 2.5 HD RED kit (Advanced Cell
Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) as described previously 21. Briefly, forty ZZ ISH probes
targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA fragment 21571-25392 (GenBank #LC528233.1) were
designed and synthesized by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (#854841). Tissue sections were
deparaffinized with xylene, underwent a series of ethanol washes and peroxidase blocking, and
were then heated in kit-provided antigen retrieval buffer and digested by kit-provided proteinase.
Sections were exposed to ISH target probe pairs and incubated at 40°C in a hybridization oven
for 2 h. After rinsing, ISH signal was amplified using kit-provided Pre-amplifier and Amplifier
conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubated with a Fast Red substrate solution for 10 min
at room temperature. Sections were then stained with hematoxylin, air-dried, and cover slipped.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 8. Weight data
was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons for experiments with ≥2
groups; unpaired t-tests were used to analyze weight data for experiments with 2 groups.
Comparisons of lymphocyte levels and lung viral load was assessed using a one-way ANOVA
with multiple comparisons for experiments with ≥2 groups; unpaired t-tests were used to analyze
weight data for experiments with 2 groups. Significance of survival data was assessed using logrank tests. In all analyses, P<0.05 is considered statistically significant.
