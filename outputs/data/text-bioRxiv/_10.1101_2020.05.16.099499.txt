Abstract

15

The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic offers a

16

unique opportunity to study the introduction and evolution of a pathogen into a

17

completely naïve human population. We identified and analysed the amino acid

18

mutations that gained prominence worldwide in the early months of the pandemic.

19

Eight mutations have been identified along the viral genome, mostly located in

20

conserved segments of the structural proteins and showing low variability among

21

coronavirus, which indicated that they might have a functional impact. At the moment

22

of writing this paper, these mutations present a varied success in the SARS-CoV-2 virus

23

population; ranging from a change in the spike protein that becomes absolutely

24

prevalent, two mutations in the nucleocapsid protein showing frequencies around 25%,

25

to a mutation in the matrix protein that nearly fades out after reaching a frequency of

26

20%.

1. Introduction

29

The emergence of the novel Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

30

CoV-2) and the subsequent pandemic has become a health problem unparalleled in the

31

last century. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be originated from an animal coronavirus that

32

successfully adapted to humans. The species of origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully

33

identified, but the virus seems to be related to SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses found

34

in bats and other mammal species, although different from them (Chan et al. 2020; Lu

35

et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020).

36

The SARS-CoV-2 genome size is around 30 kb with the typical gene structure known in

37

other betacoronaviruses: starting from the 5′, more than two-thirds of the genome

38

comprises orf1ab encoding polyproteins (nsp1 to nsp15), while the last third consists of

39

genes encoding major structural proteins; including spike (S or ORF2), envelope (E or

40

ORF4), membrane (M or ORF5), and nucleocapsid (N or ORF9) proteins. Additionally, the

41

SARS-CoV-2 contains at least 6 minor structural proteins, encoded by ORF3a, ORF6,

42

ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10 genes (Khailany et al. 2020).

43

The first cases of the novel coronavirus associated disease (CoVID-19) have been traced

44

to

45

(https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/).

46

Although the actual index case is not really known, the first sequence of the novel

47

coronavirus was produced within weeks from the emergence of the disease (Zhu et al.

48

2019). As of the moment of writing this paper, more than 16,000 sequences have been

49

produced in less than five months since the start of the pandemic. This is a unique

50

opportunity to gain insight on the evolution of a betacoronavirus in a completely naïve

human population. In this context, viral variants efficiently transmitted will have less

52

influence of the selection exerted by the immune response, since most transmissions

53

will occur from individuals before the development of an efficient immune response to

54

naïve recipients.

55

The aim of the present study was to determine the amino acid substitutions in viral

56

proteins that were widely present in available sequences of SARS-CoV-2, relating them

57

to the known chronology of the pandemic. Also, the mutations found were assessed in

58

order to try to understand its potential significance for viral fitness.

59

2. Material and methods

60

2.1. Sequences

61

SARS-CoV-2 sequences were retrieved from GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/).

62

The full set of sequences used in the present study included the 12,562 high-quality

63

complete sequences available on May 3rd, 2020. Additionally, a reference sequence from

64

SARS-CoV, pangolin, civet, and three from bat coronaviruses (Genbank accession

65

numbers AY278741, MT084071, AY572034, KY417146, MN996532 and MK211376,

66

respectively) were used for comparative purposes. The set of sequences were arranged

67

chronologically by date of isolation after the first reported SARS-CoV-2 sequences

68

(identified as Wuhan-01 from December 24th, 2019).

69

2.2. Analysis of non-synonymous mutations and selection of mutations to be studied

70

Complete genomes were aligned using the multiple alignment program ClustalW

71

(Thompson et al. 1994) and consequently split by week according to their isolation date

72

with the sequence alignment editor Bioedit (Hall 1999). Using Wuhan-01 as the

73

reference, an arbitrary date for the 1st report of the amino acid changes at the end of

74

February 2020 was set to represent an early date of the pandemic, three months after

75

the initial case was reported. Also, an arbitrary cut-off frequency of 10% was set to select

76

the amino acid substitutions that were considered widespread. Thus, any substitution

77

reported before the end of February and present in 10% or more of the frequencies in a

78

given week was studied. In order to check if the variants identified presented a

79

worldwide distribution, their geographical distribution was summarized by continents.

80

For each substitution, an alignment with the homologous proteins of SARS-CoV, civet,

81

pangolin, and bat coronaviruses was performed to assess whether the mutation

82

affected conserved or variable regions.

83

2.3 Comparison with predominant amino acid substitutions in early, mid and late

84

cases of SARS epidemic of 2003-04

85

To compare predominant non-synonymous mutations occurring during different phases

86

of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, all sequences of SARS-CoV available at Genbank for

87

which date of the case was available (directly or through literature search) were

88

collected. Sequences were classified as early, mid or late based on the common

89

classifications of cases (He et al. 2004). Analysis of mutations was done similarly to SARS-

90

CoV-2.

91

2.4 Analysis of the potential biological significance of the observed substitutions

92

Modelling of the original S protein in Wuhan-01 and the mutant protein was produced

93

using SWISS-MODEL protein template 6vsb.1.A (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/).

94

Accuracy of the models was assessed by the Global Model Quality Estimation (GQME)

95

and the Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN) scores. 3D structures were

96

rendered using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.4.

Schrödinger, LLC). The same program was used to determine changes in the protein

98

structure or distances between atoms or residues. The set of proteomic utilities in

99

EXPASY (https://www.expasy.org/proteomics) was used to check for different aspects

100

on the mutant proteins (motifs, phosphorylation sites, etc.). PROVEAN 1.1.

101

(http://provean.jcvi.org/, Choi et al. 2012) was used to gain insight on whether the

102

mutation could be deleterious or neutral. Changes in the secondary structure of proteins

103

were predicted by using the CFSSP: Chou & Fasman Secondary Structure Prediction

104

Server (https://www.biogem.org/tool/chou-fasman/, Ashok 2013).

105

When mutations affected known epitopes, impact on antigenicity was evaluated by

106

means of epitope prediction tools in the IBDB Resource web (http://tools.iedb.org/).

3.1.

109

Amino acid substitutions with significant spread in the population were mainly
located in conserved segments of structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2

110

The analysis of the set of sequences revealed that only 8 amino acid substitutions across

111

the viral genome appeared before the end of February 2020 and gained prevalence over

112

10% of the known isolates at a given time point, measuring time in weeks after the first

113

available sequence (Fig. 1). Of these, 7 substitutions were in the structural proteins

114

(ORF2-S, ORF3a, ORF5-M, ORF8, and ORF9-N) and one in the ORF1ab, specifically in

115

nsp6. Concerning their location and date, four appeared in China during January. The

116

other four appeared in Europe during the second fortnight of February, but within a

117

week, they were also reported in other continents (Supplementary Table S1).

118

Interestingly, the only substitution that became fully predominant was Asp614Gly in the

119

spike protein (ORF2-S). Gly57His in ORF3a reached a frequency of 50% at the moment

of writing this paper. It is worth noting that when the sequences where analysed by

121

continents, all mutations were spread worldwide, except the 175Met in the ORF5-M,

122

that was absent in Africa (Supplementary Table S1).

Next, we examined whether these substitutions were located in variable or conserved

regions of the viral genome. Interestingly, most of them corresponded to residues that

131

were conserved in SARS and related betacoronaviruses of pangolins, civets, or bats (Fig.

132

2).

133

The comparison with non-synonymous mutations that gained predominance in SARS-

134

CoV showed a different pattern. From early to late phases of the SARS epidemic of 2003,

135

11 substitutions gained wide spread. Three of them were located in nsp3, four in nsp4,

136

one in nsp16, and three in the spike protein (Supplementary Table S2). However,

137

mutations in SARS-CoV were located in conserved positions of civet and bat-related

138

coronaviruses but, those positions were different in pangolin.

146

The examination of the spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the

147

Asp614Gly mutation that appeared in January 2020 in Shanghai, gained predominance

148

with time. Thus, by the end of April 2020 it was almost 100% prevalent (Fig. 1).

149

Next, we checked whether this mutation emerged in a particular SARS-CoV-2 clade or

150

its spread was irrespective of the clade where a given isolate could be allocated. The

151

Gly614 could be found in different branches across the phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV-

152

2 (available at https://nextstrain.org/).

153

Residue 614 is located in the S1 domain of the spike protein. Modelling of the original

154

and mutant proteins using template 6vsb.1.A from SwissModel of the S protein of SARS-

155

CoV-2 (Wrap et al. 2020) showed that by changing Asp614 by Gly614, the distance to

156

Thr859 and its side chain increased (from 2.7 to 6.2 Å), creating a cavity and a more

157

relaxed structure (Fig. 3). The analysis of the antigenicity of the potential epitope

158

homologous to 597-625 of SARS-CoV did not show any significant difference between

159

mutants.

164

In the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, a double mutation (Arg203Lys-Gly204Arg) was

165

observed to gain predominance during the pandemic (Fig. 1). This mutation is in the

166

serin-rich (SR) segment of the linker region (LKR) of the protein. The N protein of SARS-

167

CoV is known to be bound by Ubc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of the sumoylation

168

system, probably at the SR segment. Since lysines are targets for sumoylation, we next

169

checked whether this substitution could introduce a sumoylation motif. The prediction

170

using two different methods JASSA v4 (http://www.jassa.fr/index.php?m=jassa) and

171

GPS-SUMO (http://sumosp.biocuckoo.org/) was negative. Predicted phosphorylation

172

sites and enzymes (NetPhos 3.1.) were not significantly different between variants. The

173

observed mutations were predicted to be neutral by Provean.

174

In the matrix protein, the main change was the substitution of Thr175 by Met175.

175

Thr175 was predicted to form part of a motif known to interact with 14-3-3 proteins and

176

of a potential phosphorylation site (173-SRTLSYYKL-181) targeted by protein kinases A

177

(PKA) and C (PKC), ribosomal s6 kinase (RKS), and DNA-dependent protein kinases. The

178

substitution of the THR by a MET was predicted again to be a phosphorylation site (for

179

PKA, PKC and RKS). Provean predicted that the introduction of M175 was deleterious

180

(score -3.135). Since no reliable model was available, 3D structure could not be assessed.

181

Interestingly, the presence of a M175 in the M protein occurred together with the

182

203KR204 mutation in 98% of the cases (p<0.0001). The rapid decay of this mutation

183

(Fig. 1) would be consistent with a deleterious effect.

186

Two substitutions were identified in the protein encoded by ORF3a. The first was a

187

substitution of Gln57 present in the Wuhan-01 isolate by His57, and the second was the

188

substitution of Gly251 by Val251. To note, only 0.04% of the sequences harboured the

189

double His57/Val251 mutation. The presence of His in residue 57 would be expected to

190

result in an increased positive charge at that site.

191

The Gly251Val mutation occurred in a predicted serine-phosphorylation site 248-

192

TID(G/V)SSGVV-256. The introduction of a Val reduced the prediction scores for the site

193

from a maximum >0.90 with Gly for phosphokinase B and ATM serine/threonine

194

phosphokinase to 0.73-0.82 for the same enzymes. It is worth to note that the amino

195

acid at this position was strongly correlated with the amino acid present in position 57

196

of the same protein. Thus, among the sequences harbouring His57 in ORF3a, 99.8% were

197

associated with Gly251 and only 0.2% with Val251. In contrast, for Gln57, 17% of the

198

sequences harboured Val251 (p<0.001). Similarly, His57 was only found in sequences

199

harbouring Arg203-Gly204 in the N protein, while Gln57 was found simultaneously with

200

Arg203-Gly204 (70% of the cases) or Lys203-Arg204 (30%) (p<0.001). Both mutations

201

were predicted as deleterious (scores of -3.286 for His57 and -8.581 for Val251).

202

The lack of a reliable model made impossible to make any prediction of the impact of

203

those mutations on the 3D structure or the interactions between residues. However,

204

the checking of the potential in the secondary structure of the protein revealed that

205

mutation Gln57His resulted in the elimination of a turn of the protein predicted to be in

206

Ser58. Similarly, mutation Gly251Val eliminated the turn at Gly251 but did not affect the

207

turn predicted for Ser253 (Supplementary Fig. S3).

208

Regarding the ORF8 protein, it is worth noting that the mutation of residue 84

209

(Leu84Ser) happened simultaneously with a silent mutation in nucleotide position 8987

210

(ORF1ab, nsp4, AT). This permitted to distinguish 2 clades in the initial weeks of the

211

pandemic that contained isolates from Wuhan, Shanghai, and Hong-Kong

212

(Supplementary Fig. S4). These clades did correspond to the L and S types reported by

213

Tang et al. (2020). This mutation was predicted to be neutral.

214

Finally, the last change was found in the nsp6 protein, Leu37Phe, which significance was

215

unclear. This mutation was also predicted to be neutral.

216

4. Discussion

217

The present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a worst-case scenario of the introduction of a new

218

agent that transmits easily in a completely naïve population. In this context,

219

transmission events occur in an uncommonly high scale, in a very short period of time

220

and with little selective pressures from the immune system if compared to an endemic

221

situation. This scenario would permit the arising of a great diversity of viral variants of

222

which the fitter could be expected to gain predominance.

223

In the present study, we identified 8 early mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that

224

gained prevalence over 10% at some point during the pandemic. This cut-off was

225

arbitrarily set to discriminate random mutations and errors in sequencing from changes

226

that might have a bigger impact. Certainly, this approach has the limitation of neglecting

227

some mutations with lesser prevalence that still can be biologically significant. Time will

228

show it.

229

It is worth noting that 7 out of 8 of the widely spread mutations occurred in residues

230

that were highly conserved in related coronaviruses of bats, pangolins, civets, or in SARS12

231

CoV (Fig. 2). Conserved regions are usually assumed to be functionally relevant and thus,

232

mutations in them may have deleterious effects or can be hardly tolerated; if so, they

233

will be probably removed in the future. A mutation in a highly conserved region that

234

becomes widespread and persists can be thought as representative of a change that

235

increases viral fitness. In the present case, we found three different situations:

236

mutations that expanded and rise to predominance, mutations that expanded to a

237

certain extent and fade out, and mutations that are apparently expanding but not yet

238

predominant. This pattern affecting conserved regions was also seen for SARS-CoV

239

although the affected proteins were different. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-2 most of the

240

mutations were in structural proteins, while in SARS-CoV were in non-structural ones,

241

suggesting that the adaption process from the original host species to human was

242

different in these two cases. When the spike protein was examined, this difference was

243

more obvious. Mutations in SARS-CoV occurred in positions conserved in the civet and

244

bat-related coronaviruses but different from those of pangolin and SARS-CoV-2. In

245

contrast, spike mutation in position 614 of SARS-CoV-2 affected a residue that was

246

conserved in betacoronaviruses of pangolins, civets, bats, and SARS-CoV. This would be

247

compatible with a scenario where those mutations affected the viral fitness for that

248

particular new host, namely humans. The scale of the viral replication in the scenario of

249

a pandemic would be unprecedented for those coronaviruses and will provide the

250

probability for such beneficial mutations to appear and expand.

251

The Asp614Gly mutation in S protein is an example of a mutation becoming fully

252

predominant. A previous report (Korber et al. 2020) already indicated its emergence.

253

Recently, Bhattacharyya et al. (2020) suggested that the predominance of this mutation

254

as the pandemic advanced and the low proportion in initial phases of it was related to a

257

mutation would introduce a cleavage site for that enzyme. This would explain, at least

258

partially, the spread of this mutant outside Asia.

259

We do agree with Korber et al. (2020) regarding the possibility that the Asp214Gly

260

mutation produced a laxer interaction between S1 and S2 spike domains that might

261

facilitate shedding of S1 from membrane-bound S2. In SARS-CoV, the segment of S

262

protein including residues 597-625 contains epitopes inducing both neutralizing

263

antibodies (positions 604-625 in SARS-CoV) and antibodies participating in an antibody-

264

dependent enhancement (ADE) in animal models (residues 597-625) (Wang et al. 2016).

265

The mutation Asp614Gly would affect the epitope segment inducing ADE but not the

266

one inducing neutralizing antibodies. Although, it has been hypothesized that ADE may

267

have a role in CoVID-19 (Tetro 2020) this has not been demonstrated (Sharma 2020).

268

The effects of the mutation on the immune escape or the transmission potential cannot

269

be concluded at this moment.

270

Regarding the mutations found in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, the first surprising

271

fact was to find two consecutive substitutions in the highly conserved serine-rich

272

segment of the LKR region of the protein. The LKR region is essential for conferring

273

flexibility to the protein as well as for cell signalling, binding to RNA and to M protein. It

274

also contains multiple phosphorylation sites in the SR segment that are thought to be

275

essential (Reviewed by McBride et al. 2014). Since the mutant nucleocapsid introduced

276

a Lys residue - a canonical target for sumoylation - and sumoylation occurs in this region

277

by analogy to SARS-CoV (Fan et al. 2006) we also tested it. No significant differences

278

were determined between the original and the mutant sequences using prediction tools

279

for phosphorylation or sumoylation.

280

Interaction of the nucleocapsid protein with the M protein is thought to happen

281

between the SR-region and the C-terminal domain of M (Escors et al. 2001; Kuo and

282

Masters 2002). We found that the M175 phenotype of the M protein was almost

283

exclusively associated to the 203K-204R phenotype of the nucleocapsid protein. It is

284

tempting to hypothesize that the above-mentioned residues may be involved in such

285

interaction. Besides this, the introduction of an additional charge in the SR segment may

286

enhance interaction with RNA which core is negatively charged.

287

Changes in the ORF3a protein have been recently reported to define microclonal clades

288

of SARS-CoV2 (Issa et al. 2020). We have found that the introduction of Val251 was

289

apparently non compatible with His57. We determined that, probably, such mutations

290

affected the secondary structure by changing the number of turns. Considering that

291

both residues are out of the functional domains proposed by Issa et al. (2020), those

292

changes in the structure of the protein may modify interactions enough to be non-

293

compatible. Interestingly, mutations in ORF3a protein and mutations in the

294

nucleocapsid protein were related. To our knowledge, these two proteins have not been

295

investigated for interactions; however, this finding suggests that might be an interaction

296

between them.

297

ORF8 mutation Leu84Ser was reported before (Tang et al. 2020). The authors suggested

298

that the Leu variant (called L) is more aggressive and spreads easier. The evolution of

299

the proportion of strains harbouring this mutation would not support the idea of a

300

higher transmissibility of the L variant since its frequency clearly declined. Certainly, the
15

301

introduction of such variant in different countries applying control measures earlier or

302

later could have had an impact on the spread of the variants as well.

303

Finally, the nsp6 mutation at position 37 is difficult to interpret. The nsp6 of

304

coronaviruses is part of the replication machinery of the virus and has been reported to

305

induce autophagosomes (Benvenuto et al. 2020). The same authors suggested that it

306

may lead to a lower stability of the protein structure. Lacking a verified model for the

307

protein it is difficult to assess whether this happens or not. Interestingly, the same

308

authors indicated that the distribution of the Leu phenotype was restricted to Asia while

309

the Phe was common in other parts of the world. According to our analysis, the Phe

310

phenotype has almost disappeared in current sequences. The discrepancy could be

311

originated in the fact that Benvenuto et al. (2020) analysed the 351 sequences available

312

in a past moment while in the present analysis thousands of sequences from all over the

313

world have been included.

314

In summary, the present is a comprehensive report of the amino acid mutations that

315

gained spread during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic up to now. Most of the substitutions

316

gaining wide diffusion occurred in conserved positions indicating that they probably had

317

a functional impact but, differently from SARS-CoV, they accumulated in structural

318

proteins. Interestingly, most of these mutations faded out, except for the Asp614Gly in

319

the S protein that became predominant suggesting that it contributed to viral fitness.

320

Some others are still increasing in prevalence, like the mutations in the nucleocapsid

321

protein here reported and that might be related to the mutations in the M protein. This

322

data may serve to gain further insight in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.
