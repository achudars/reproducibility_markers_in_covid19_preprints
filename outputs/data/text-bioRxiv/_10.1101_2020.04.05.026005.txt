Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public-health emergency of international
concern and thus calling for the development of safe and effective therapeutics and prophylactics
particularly a vaccine to protect against the infection. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is an
attractive candidate for vaccine, antibodies and inhibitor development because of many roles it
plays in attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. In this study, we characterized the SARSCoV-2 spike glycoprotein by immune-informatics techniques to put forward potential B and T
cell epitopes, followed by the use of epitopes in construction of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine
construct (MEPVC). The MEPVC revealed robust host immune system simulation with high
production of immunoglobulins, cytokines and interleukins. Stable conformation of the MEPVC
with a representative innate immune TLR3 receptor was observed involving strong hydrophobic
and hydrophilic chemical interactions, along with enhanced contribution from salt-bridges
towards inter-molecular stability. Molecular dynamics simulation in solution aided further in
interpreting strong affinity of the MEPVC for TLR3. This stability is the attribute of several vital
residues from both TLR3 and MEPVC as shown by radial distribution function (RDF) and a
novel analytical tool axial frequency distribution (AFD). Comprehensive binding free energies
estimation was provided at the end that concluded major domination by electrostatic and minor
from van der Waals. Summing all, the designed MEPVC has tremendous potential of providing
protective immunity against COVID-19 and thus has the potential to be considered in
experimental studies.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus emerged in Wuhan city of Hubei province in
China and has since spread globally. The virus belongs to clade B of family Coronaviridae in the
order Nidovirales, and genera Betacoronavirus and caused pulmonary disease outbreak [1,2]. It
is positive-sense RNA, enveloped and non-segmented virus and named as SARS-CoV-2 as it
share 82% sequence identity with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)[3,4]. SARS-CoV-2 caused
coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and evidence suggest a zoonotic origin of this disease [5].
Though the zoonotic transmission is not completely understood but facts provide the ground that
it proliferates from the seafood market Huanan in Wuhan and human-to-human transmission
resultant into the exponential increase in number of cases [6,7]. As of March 24, 386,332 cases
are reported worldwide with 16,747 deaths and 102,333 recovered patients. Among the active
cases, 267,252 are currently infected, 255,166 (95%) are in mild conditions and 12,086 (5%) are
seriously ill. serisouly illed. Among the 119,080 closed cases, 102,333 (86%) are recovered
whereas 16,747 (14%) die. On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) affirmed
COVID-19 as a pandemic (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes a highly glycosylated, homotrimeric class I viral fusion spike protein to
enter into host cells [8]. This protein is found in a metastable pre-fusion state which undergoes a
structural rearrangement facilitating viral membrane fusion with the host cell[9–11]. The binding
of S1 subunit to a host-angiotensin-converting enzyme initiates this process and disrupts the prefusion trimeric structure resulting into S1 subunit dispersion and stabilizes the S2 subunit to a
post-fusion conformation[12]. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 goes through a hingelike conformational change that temporarily hides or exposes the determinants of receptor
binding in order to occupy a host-cell receptor [11]. Down and up conformation states are
recognized where former is related to the receptor-inaccessible state and the later one explains
receptor-accessible state and considered as less stable [13–16]. This critical role of the spike
protein makes it an important target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and detailed study of
the pre-fusion S structure would provide information at atomic-level helping in the design and
development of a vaccine [17–21]. Current data indicates that SARS-CoV-2 spike and SARSCoV spike both share the same functional receptor (host cell) —angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) [22,23]. Interestingly, ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain with ∼15 nM
affinity, about 10-20 folds higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV spike [24]. One possible
reason for SARS-CoV-2 capability of spreading infection from human-to-human is SARS-CoV2 spike’s high affinity for human ACE2[25]. Series of cellular immune and humoral responses
can be triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infections [26]. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM were
noticeable after the 2 weeks of onset of infection which are specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
High titers of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte
responses have been identified in the patients who have improved from SARS-CoV-2. This
phenomenon clearly suggest that both cellular and humoral immune reactions are vital to
clearing the SARS-CoV-2 infection [26–30].
The study presented, herein, is an attempt to get insights about antigenic determinants of SARSCoV-2 spike glycoprotein and highlight all antigenic epitopes [31] of the spike that can be used
specifically for the design of a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC) [32]to counter
COVID-19 infections. The epitopes predicted by immunoinformatics techniques were fused
together as well as to β-defensin adjuvant [33,34] to boost the antibody production and long3

lasting immunological responses. Blind docking protocol was implemented to gain MEPVC best
possible binding mode with respect to representative innate immune receptor TLR3 [35]. The
docked solution was further utilized in dynamics simulations to study the structural dynamics
and stability of the complex [36]. Finally, to confirm intermolecular interactions and point all
noteworthy residues crucial for intermolecular stability, binding free energies [37] for the system
were estimated. In a nutshell, this study reflects excellent outcomes for experimental
vaccinologists to develop a vaccine to control pandemic COVID-19 infections.
2. Materials and Methods
Complete flow of the in silico designed methodology for MEPVC targeting SARS-CoV-2 9
spike is demonstrated in Fig.1.
2.1. Epitopes Mapping for Spike Protein
The amino acid sequence of spike glycoprotein protein from SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from
NCBI SARS-CoV-2 data hub and considered first in the epitope mapping phase, where T cell
epitopes derived from B-cell were predicted using immune epitopes data base (IEDB)[38].
Linear B cell epitopes were mapped using Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction 2.0 [39] and
those with score greater than 0.5 were subjected to T-cell epitopes identification step. The
epitopes were projected for association with reference set of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC): MHC class I [40] and MHC class II [41] alleles on the basis of percentile score.
Epitopes with lowest percentile score were considered only as high affinity binders. The selected
epitopes were then used in MHCPred 2.0 [42] to decipher their binding affinity potential for
predominant HLA II DRB*0101 and only those with IC50 value < 100 nM were categorized as
excellent DRB*0101 binders [43]. VirulentPred [44] was employed next to reveal virulent nature
of the epitopes setting the cut-off to 0.5. Antigenic epitopes were highlighted by VaxiJen 2.0
[45]. Allergenic epitopes were discarded through AllerTop 2.0 [46] and toxic potential of nonallergic epitopes was evaluated via ToxinPred [47]. The non-toxic epitopes were lastly
investigated for their ability of inducing IFN-γ using an IFN epitope server [48]. Conservation
across the world population of the final set of epitopes was done through IEDB epitope
conservation analysis tool [49].

2.2. Multi-Epitopes Peptide Vaccine Construct (MEPVC) Designing and Post Analysis
All filtered epitopes were linked together through AAY linkers [50] to design a multi-epitope
peptide (MEP). The resultant peptide was further linked to an immunological β-defensin (an
adjuvant) to construct a multi-epitope peptide vaccine construct (MEPVC) and in this way
immunogenicity can be enhanced. The physicochemical properties of designed MEPVC was
predicted by ProtParam tool [51] of EXPASSY server. The three dimensional (3D) structure of
the MEPVC was modeled ab initio by 3Dpro of SCRATCH protein server [52]. Following, loop
modeling was done in the 3D structure of MEPVC via GlaxyLoop [53] from GlaxyWeb and
subsequently refined through GalaxyRefine [54]. Disulfide engineering was applied on the
MEPVC refined model via Design 2.0 [55] as disulfide bonds strengthen structure stability. The

MEPVC sequence was translated reversibly for optimization of codon usage according to
Escherichia coli K12 expression system in order to get high expression rate [56]. For this, Java
Codon Adaptation Tool (JCat) [57] was used and expression of the cloned MEPVC was assessed
by GC % and codon adaptation index (CAI) value. SnapGene (https://www.snapgene.com/) was
used to clone the optimized MEPVC cDNA into pET-28a (+) expression vector.
2.3. In Silico Immune Profiling of MEPVC
Immunogenic potential of the MEPVC was conducted in silico using C-ImmSim server [58,59].
The server used machine learning techniques along with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)
for prediction of the host immune system response to the antigen. The immune system responds
from three mammalian anatomical regions: bone marrow, lymph nodes and thymus. The input
parameters for the immune simulations are as follows: number of steps (100), volume (10),
random seed (12345), HLA (A0101, A0101, B0702, B0702, DRB1_0101, DRB1_0101), number
of injection set to 1. The rest of parameters were treated as default.
2.4. Molecular Docking of MEPVC
The MEPVC affinity for an appropriate immune receptor as an agonist was checked in the step
of molecular docking[60]. TLR3 available under PDB id of 1ZIW was retrieved and used as a
receptor molecule. TLR3 also named as CD283 is a transmembrane protein belongs to the family
of pattern recognition receptor [61]. It detects viral infection-associated dsRNA and evoke the
activation of interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF3) and (Nuclear Factor kappa-lightchain-enhancer) NF-kB [62]. Unlike other TLRs, TLR3 uses TIR-domain-containing adapterinducing interferon-β (TRIF) as a primary adapter [63]. IRF3 eventually induces the
development of type I interferons leading to the activation of innate immune system and
eventually to long lasting adaptive immunity [64]. The TLR3 receptor and MEPVC were used in
a blind docking approach through an online PATCHDOCK server interface [65]. The interacting
molecules were docked according to the shape complementarity principle. The clustering RMSD
is allowed to default 4.0 Å. The output docked solutions were immediately refined with Fast
Interaction Refinement in Molecular Docking (FireDock) server [66] which provides an efficient
framework for refining PATCHDOCK complexes. The refined complexes were examined and
one with lowest global energy was considered as top ranked. The opted complex was subjected
to in-depth MEPVC conformation with respect to the TLR3 using UCSF Chimera 1.13.1[67].
2.5. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation
MD simulation was applied on the selected top complex for 50-ns to understand complex
dynamics and stability for practical applications. This assay was categorized into three phases:
(i) parameters file preparation (ii) pre-processing, and (iii) simulation production [68]. In first
phase using an antechamber module of AMBER16 [69], complex libraries and set of parameters
for TLR3 and MEPVC were generated. The complex system was solvated into 12 Å TIP3P
solvation box achieved through Leap module of AMBER. The intermolecular and intramolecular
interactions of the system were determined by ff14SB force [70] field. Counter ions in the form
of Na+ were added to the system for charge neutralization. In the system pre-processing stage,
complex energy was optimized through several rounds: minimization of complete set of

hydrogen atoms for 500 steps, minimization of system solvation box energy for 1000 steps with
restraint of 200 kcal/mol – Å2 on the remaining system, minimization of complete set of system
atoms again for 1000 steps with applied restraint of 5 kcal/mol –Å2 applied on system carbon
alpha atoms, and 300 steps of minimization on system non-heavy atoms with restraint of 100
kcal/mol –Å2 on other system components. The complex system then underwent a heating step
where the complex was heated gradually to 300K through NVT ensemble, maintained through
Langevin dynamics [71] and SHAKE algorithm [72] to restrain hydrogen bonds. Complex
equilibration was achieved for 100-ps. Pressure on the system was maintained using NPT
ensemble allowing restraint on Cα atoms of 5 kcal/mol – Å2. In the simulation production,
trajectories of 50-ns were produced on time scale of 2-fs. Non-bounded interactions were
differentiated by describing cut-off distance of 8.0 Å.CPPTRAJ module [73] was lastly used for
statistical computation of different structure parameters to probe complex stability. The MD
simulation trajectories were visualized and analyzed in Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) 1.9.3
[74].
2.6. Axial Frequency Distribution Analysis
Axial frequency distribution or simply AFD [75] is a novel analytical technique run on
simulation trajectories to access ligand 3D conformation with respect to reference receptor atom.
Such local structural movements are not captured by any other available technique. AFD can be
mathematically presented by Eq.I,
𝐴𝐹𝐷 = ∑𝑘,𝑙
𝑖=1,𝑗=1 𝑚𝑖, 𝑗……………………………………………………………………… Eq.I
where, i and j are ligand atom coordinates on X and Y axis with cut-off value k and l,
respectively. The mi,j sums interactions frequency that fall in the coordinate (i,j).
2.7. Calculating Binding Free Energy for TLR3-MEPVC
The interaction energy and solvation free energy for TLR3 receptor, MEPVC, TLR3-MEPVC
complex were calculated utilizing the MMPBSA.py module [76] of AMBER16. Also, an
average of the above was estimated as a net binding free energy of the system. The binding free
energy was computed through MM-PBSA method and its counterpart MM-GBSA of AMBER
with objective to derive the difference between bound and unbound states of solvated
conformations of the same molecule [77]. Mathematically, the binding free energy can be
calculated though Eq.II,
ΔG bind,solv = ΔG bind, vaccum + ΔG solv, TLR3-MEPVC – (ΔG solv, MEPVC + ΔG solv, TLR3)……………Eq.II
For all three states of the system, the solvation energy was calculated by solving either Poisson
Boltzman (PB) or Generalized Born (GB) equation and thus it will give electrostatic contribution
of the solvation state. It also allow the addition of empirical term for hydrophobic contributions
as shown in Eq.III.
ΔG solv = G electrostatic, ϵ= 80 – G electrostatic, ϵ= 1 +ΔG hydrophobic………………………………… Eq.III

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Prioritization of Potential Epitopes
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was targeted for MEPVC designing because of many filters
it fulfilled required for a potential vaccine candidate. First, it does not share any significant
homology to the human host and as such chances of autoimmune responses are negligible
[78]. Second, the protein is also not found to have any sequence identity to the mouse
proteome and thus accurate immunological findings can be deciphered from in vivo mice
experimentations [79]. This spike protein only harbored one transmembrane helix ensuring
the wet lab protein cloning and expression for antigen analysis easy [80]. Antigenicity is
another factor that make this candidate highly suitable for vaccine designing as this allows
efficient binding to the products of host immune system [81]. Further, this protein is strongly
adhesive which makes it an excellent target for creation of adhesion based vaccine [82].
Lastly, all the sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are highly conserved thus a vaccine
based on its sequence will be highly likely to have broad spectrum immunological
implications [83]. Prioritization of potential epitopes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
commenced with the mapping of B-cell epitopes that predicted total of 34 epitopes of vary
length ranging from one to 62 (S Table 1). The average score predicted for these B cell
epitopes is 0.470, maximum (max) of 0.696 and minimum (min) of 0.188 (Fig.2). Each Bcell epitope was then analyzed in MHC-1 alleles binding regions prediction [84]. A set of
reference alleles to which these epitopes interact with are: HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01,
HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:03, HLA-A*02:03, HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*02:06, HLAA*03:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*23:01, HLA-B*08:01,
HLA-A*23:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-A*26:01, HLA-A*26:01, HLAA*30:01, HLA-A*30:01, HLA-B*57:01, HLA-A*30:02, HLA-A*31:01, HLA-B*58:01 ,
HLA-A*32:01, HLA-A*33:01, HLA-A*33:01, HLA-A*68:01, HLA-A*68:01, HLAA*68:02, HLA-A*68:02, HLA-A*30:02, HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*51:01, HLA-B*07:02,
HLA-B*08:01, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-A*31:01, HLAB*35:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:03,
HLA-B*44:03, HLA-B*51:01, HLA-A*01:01, HLA-B*53:01, HLA-B*53:01, HLAB*57:01, HLA-A*32:01, and HLA-B*58:01. These alleles have > 97% population coverage.
The predicted epitopes were then screened and stringent criteria of lowest percentile score
was used to choose the excellent binders. Afterward, the B cell epitopes were simultaneously
run in MHC-II alleles binding [85]. Likewise MHC-I, reference set of MHC-II binding were:
HLA-DRB4*01:01, HLA-DRB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*04:05, HLA-DRB1*07:01, HLADRB1*09:01, HLA-DRB1*11:01, HLA-DRB1*03:01,
HLA-DRB1*13:02, HLADRB1*15:01, HLA-DRB3*01:01, HLA-DRB1*12:01, HLA-DRB3*02:02, HLADRB1*08:02, HLA-DRB1*01:01, and HLA-DRB5*01:01. The MHC-II predicted epitopes
were also filtered on basis of percentile score and then cross checked with the selected MHCI allele and those common in both classes were considered only which were 50 in numbers.
The shortlisted common MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes then subjected to antigenicity check.
In this check, ability of the filtered B-cell derived T-cell epitopes ability to evoke and bind to
products of adaptive immunity. This yielded 38 epitopes all of which have strong ability to
bind to the most prevalent DRB*0101 with average IC50 score of 35.6552, max of 98 and min
of 0.89.The antigenic epitopes then underwent allergenicity check to discard allergic peptides
that may cause allergic reactions [86]. This resulted into 31 epitopes. Non-toxic epitopes
were 7 whereas 6 were IFN-gamma producer (Fig.3). The set of epitopes obtained at different

stages of epitope mapping phase is tabulated in Table 1. These epitopes appear to provide
coverage to 98% of the world population (Fig.4). The coverage can split as: 98.54% in East
Asia, 96.06% in Northeast Asia, 97.46% in South Asia, 95.83% in Southeast Asia, 94.29% in

3.2. MEPVC Designing
Prioritized T cell epitopes derived from B cells were fused together tandemly by AAY linkers
to make a multi-epitope peptide (MEP). AAY linker avoid formation of junctional epitopes
and as such enhance epitope presentation [87]. To the N-terminal of MEP, EAAAK linker
was added to attach β-defensin as an adjuvant leading to the design of a MEPVC. The
MEPVC is schematically shown in Fig.5A. MEPVC offers many advantages compared to a
separate antigenic peptide. Such vaccines induce both CD4+ and CD8+ responses and the
antigens optimization are optimal. EAAAK is a rigid spacer and allow separation of the
attached domain and promoting efficient immune processing of the epitopes [88]. β-defensins
are potent immune adjuvants as they are capable of significantly enhancing production of
lymphokines resulting into antigen-specific Ig production and T cell-dependent cellular
immunity.

3.3. MEPVC has Appropriate Biophysicochemical Properties
Physicochemical properties of the MEPVC were evaluated in order to assist experimentalists
in the field to setup experiments accordingly in vitro and in vivo. The length of MEPVC is
spanned across 110 amino acids and has molecular weight of 13.30 kDa. Vaccine construct
with weight less than 110 kDa is generally believed to effective vaccine target because of its
easier purification. Theoretical pI of MEPVC is 9.8 and aids in locating MEPVC on 2D gel.
MEPVC aliphatic index is 69.08 projecting the vaccine thermostable at different
temperatures. The total number of negatively charged and positively charges residues are 8
and 22, respectively. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) score computed for the
MEPVC is -0.545, illustrating hydrophilic nature of the protein and is likely to interact with
water molecules. The estimated half-life of MEPVC in mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro is

30 hours, yeast, in vivo is greater than 20 hours, and Escherichia coli, in vivo higher than 10
hours. The antigenicity of the MEPVC was cross-checked and predicted highly antigenic
with value of 0.69. Total entropy of the protein is 17.0170 which is considered ideal and also
the vaccine has no transmembrane helices (alpha helical transmembrane protein, 0.0474783
and beta barrel transmembrane protein, 0.0060384) hence no difficulties can be anticipated in
cloning and expression analysis. The predicted solubility upon overexpression of MEPVC is
0.965751 reflecting higher solubility of MEPVC.
3.4. Modeling and Refinement of MEPVC
The 3D model of the MEPVC was constructed using ab initio 3Dpro predictor as no
appropriate template was available for homology modeling and threading methods. The 3D
structure of MEPVC is shown in Fig.5B. The structure secured 85.4% of residues in the
Ramachandran favored, 12.6%, 1.9% and 0% residues in additionally allowed, generously
allowed and disallowed regions, respectively. As the predicted MEPVC unit has number of
loop regions that need to be modeled proper before moving forward. In total, five sets of
residues: Alas7-Lys32, Ile63-Gly69, Cys73-Arg77, Thr87-Pro102, and Asn113-Val119 were
loop modeled. The loop modeled structure increased the Ramachandran favored residues
percentage to 92.3%, residues in allowed region reduced to 6.7%, residues of generously
allowed region to 1.0% and disallowed remained to 0%. The structure was subjected to
structure perturbations and relaxations to obtain a refined model. Among the generated
structures (S-Table 2), the first model was selected as it has improved Rama favored score,
lowest stable galaxy energy of 0.96, improved clash score of 23.1 and good MolProbity
value. Similarly, the structure lacks poor rotamers in contrast to the original structure. The
Ramachandran statistics for the refined 3D structure are in following order: Ramachandran
favored residues (93.2%), additionally allowed region (5.8%), generously allowed region
(1.0%) and disallowed region (0 %). The Z-score of the refined MEPVC is -4.3 and within
the score range of same size protein in structure data bases (S-Fig.1).

3.5. Disulfide engineering and in silico cloning of the MEPVC
Further, disulfide engineering of the MEPVC was performed in order to optimize molecular
interactions and confer considerable stability by attaining precise geometric conformation
[89,90]. Eight pairs of residues were selected to be replaced with cysteine amino acid. These
pairs are: Gln7-Ala19 (χ3 angle,+118, energy value, 4.20 kcal/mol), Cys18-Leu21 (χ3
angle,+84.35, energy value, 3.69 kcal/mol), Lys44-Ala47 (χ3 angle,+74.17, energy value,5.59
kcal/mol), Arg57-Ala61 (χ3 angle,+122.71 , energy value,6.14 kcal/mol), Ala72-Ala85 (χ3
angle,-62.92, energy value,4.40 kcal/mol), Ala73-Ala82 (χ3 angle, , energy value, kcal/mol),
Leu92-Glu95 (χ3 angle, -102.37 , energy value, 3.86 kcal/mol), and Phe111-Pro117 (χ3
angle,-96.20 , energy value,4.14 kcal/mol). These residues have either higher energy level i.e.
> 2 kcal/mol and χ3 angle out of range (< −87 and > + 97) were selected on purpose to make
them stable. The original and disulfide mutant MEPVC structures are shown in Fig.6. The
primary purpose of in silico cloning of the MEPVC was guide molecular biologist and
genetic engineers about the possible cloning sites and predicted level of expression in a
specific expression system for instance here in this study we used E. coli K12 system. Prior to
cloning, reverse translation of the MEPVC sequence was conducted to have an optimized
codon usage as per E. coli K12 to yield its max expression. The CAI value of the improved
MEPVC sequence is 1 indicating ideal expression of the vaccine [91]. The GC content
whereas is 53.2 % nearly to the E. coli K12 and range within the optimum ranged between 30
% and 70%. The cloned MEPVC is shown in Fig.7.

3.6. In silico Immune Simulation
Both primary and secondary immune responses seem to play a significant contribution
against the pathogen and may be compatible to the actual immune response. The in silico host
immune system response to the antigen is shown in Fig.8. High concentration of IgG +IgG
and IgM was characterized at the primary response, followed by IgM, IgG1+ IgG2 and IgG1
at both primary and secondary stages with concomitant of antigen reduction. Additionally,
robust response of interleukins and cytokines were observed. All this suggest the efficient
immune response and clearance of the pathogen upon subsequent encounters. Elevated B cell
population including memory cells and different isotypes in response to the antigen, points to
the long lasting formation of memory and isotype switching. The T helper cell population
additionally with the cytotoxic T cell and their respective memory development are in strong
agreement of strong response to the antigen.

3.7. Interaction of MEPVC and TLR3 Promotes Formation of Strong Complex
Bioinformatic modelling driven molecular docking of the desingned MEPVC to one
representative innate immune response receptor TLR3 was carried out in order to decode
MEPVC potential of binding to the innate immune receptors. This was fundamental to
understand as TLR3 is significant in recognition of virus associated molecular patterns and of
activaiton of type I interferons and NF-kappa B. The docking assesment predicted top 20
complexes sorted mainlny on scoring functions along with interacting molecules area size,
desolvation energy, and complexes actual rigid transformation. Following, the complexes
were subjected to FireDock web server for refinement assay. This ease in discarding
flexibility errors of the docking procedure and provide a deep refinement of the predictions
thus limiting the chances of false positive docking calculations. According to the global
energy, solution 8 was considered as a best complex with net global energy of -20.78 kJ/mol
(Table 2). This energy is the output of -16.88 kJ/mol attractive van der Waals (vdW), 3.81
kJ/mol repulsive vdW, 8.14 kJ/mol atomic contact energy (ACE), and -0.93 kJ/mol hydrogen
bond energy. The docked conformation and chemical interacting residues of the MEPVC
with TLR3 is shown in Fig.9. Visual inspection of the complex leads to observation of deep
binding of the MEPVC at the center of TLR3 and favor rigorously rigoursly hydrogen and
weak van dar Waals interactions with various residues of TLR3. Within 3 Å, the MEPVC

3.8. MD Simulations Supported Docked Complex Stability and Equilibrium
The stability of MEPVC with TLR3 was further investigated through MD simulations. The
trajectories of MD simulations were used in vital statistical analysis to decode backbone
stability and residual flexibility. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) [92,93] was performed
first that compute average distance of backbone carbon alpha atoms of superimposed frames
(Fig.10A). The average RMSD for the system is 3.23 Å with max of 4.4 Å at 24-ns. An
initial sudden change in RMSD can be seen up to 2.7-ns that may be due to adjustments
adopted by the complex when exposed to dynamics forces and milieu. The second minor
RMSD shift can be noticed between 22-ns to 26-ns. Afterward, the system is quite stable with
not global and local conformational changes specified. Next, root mean square fluctuations
(RMSF) [94] was applied on the system trajectories (Fig.10B). RMSF is the average residual
mobility of complex residues from its mean position. Mean RMSF for the MEPVC-TLR3
complex calculated is 1.60 Å with max of 8.6 Å pointed at the N-terminal of the MEPVC.
Most of the interacting residues of the MEPVC with TLR3 are subject to minor fluctuations,
a fact in analogy to complex high stability. The thermal residual deviation was assessed
afterward by beta-factor (β-factor) [95], the outcomes of which is strongly correlated to the
RMSF and hence further affirming system stability (Fig.10C). The average β-factor of the
system analyzed is 88.64 Å² with max of 1956.23 Å². Lastly, we evaluated the compactness
of the system by means of radius of gyration (Rg) [96] analysis (Fig.10D). High Rg and low
Rg illustrate the magnitude of system compactness and system less tight packing. It further
tell us the whether the system of interest in order or not. Highly compact system is an
indication of system stability and vice versa. The mean Rg for our system is 55.8411 Å with
max score of 74.884 reflecting higher ordered and compact nature of the system.

3.9. Hydrogen bonds Analysis
Hydrogen bonds are dipole-dipole attractive forces and formed when a hydrogen atom
bounded to a highly electronegative atom such as F, N, and O is attracted by another
electronegative atom [97]. The strength of a hydrogen bond vary from 4 kJ to 50 kJ per mole.
Hydrogen bonds are deemed vital in molecular recognition and provide rigidity in achieving
stable conformation [98]. The frequency of hydrogen bonds in each frame of the MD
simulation trajectories can be visualized in Fig.11A. These hydrogen bonds are extracted by
mean of VMD HBonds plugin and are 104 in number as tabulated in Table 3. The cut-off
distance set is 3.0 Å and cut-off angle 20 degrees. Each residue pair may for one, two or more
each of which is counted separately. The min, mean and max number of hydrogen bonds
between MEPVC and TLR3 are 1, 5, and 12, respectively.
3.10. Radial Distribution Function and Inter Molecular Interactions
The distribution and bonding pattern of intermolecular interactions of the MEPVC residues
atom(s) with respect to the TLR3 were studied through radial distribution function (RDF)
(Abbasi et al., 2016; Donohue, 1954; Kouetcha et al., 2017). RDF mainly describes distance
‘r’ between two entities and is represented by g(r). The factor ‘r’ is extracted from simulation
trajectories and range from o to ∞ [75]. The hydrogen bonds predicted by VMD were utilized
in RDF that shown only 8 interactions between MEPVC and TLR3 with good affinity for
each other. In these interactions, TLR3 residues (atoms) are: Asp52:OD1, Gln78:HE21,
Glu98:OE1, Asp124:OD2, Lys171:HZ3, Asp251:OD2, Glu323:OE2, and Glu328:OE1 are
found to have strong radii distribution to their counterpart MEPVC residues (atoms):
Arg705:HH11, Arg705: O, Lys679:HZ3, Arg706:HH12, Glu675:OE1, Asn633:HD22,
Arg643:HH22, and Tyr638: HH, respectively. The RDF plots for the above said interactions
are illustrated in Fig.11B. The interaction between Asp124-OD2 and Arg706-HH12 has a
refined distribution pattern and highest density distribution among all. The max g(r) value for
this interaction is 3.51 observed at distance range of 1 Å. This is followed by Glu328-OE1Tyr638-HH with max g(r) value of 3.26 mostly interaction at distance range of 0.6 Å. The
Glu323-OE2-Arg643-HH22 is also much refined having g(r) value of 1.98 and mostly
interacts within distance range of 0.6 Å. The remaining interactions density distribution is not
confined and vary considerably but important from MEPVC and TLR3 interaction point of
view.
3.11. Salt Bridges and TLR3-MEPVC Stability
Salt bridges are non-covalent in nature and the outcome of interactions between two ionized
states [101]. These interactions comprised two parts: an electrostatic interaction and a
hydrogen bond. In salt bridges, lysine or arginine typically behave as base where glutamine
or aspartate as acid and the bridge is created when carboxylic acid group allows a proton
migration to guanidine and amine group in arginine. Salt bridges are the strongest among all
non-covalent interactions and contribute to a major extent in biomolecular stability [102–
104]. In total, 17 salt bridges were identified between TLR3 and MEPVC within the cut-off
distance of 3.2 Å as can be depicted from Fig.11C. The higher numbers of salt bridges were
recorded for TLR3-Glu628 and MEPVC-Lys685. The mean number of salt bridges for this
interaction is 18, max, 35 and min, 3. The count for other salt bridges from TLR3 to MEPVC
is in following order: Asp124-Arg706 (mean, 3, max,7 and min,3), Glu98-Lys679 (mean, 5,
max,10 and min,4), Asp402-Arg641 (mean, 12, max, 18 and min, 4), Glu146-Arg706
(mean,7 max,11 and min,3), Glu146-Lys679 (mean,5 max,13 and min,2), Glu272-Lys655

3.12. Density Distribution and Local Structure Movements
The vital hydrogen bond interactions involved between TLR3 receptor and MEPVC
shortlisted by VMD were subjected to a novel AFD analysis to elucidate 3D movements of
MEPVC atoms with respect to a reference TLR3 residues atom in simulation time. To this
objective, interactions mentioned in the RDF were used in AFD. Preliminary investigation
suggested that only three interactions: TLR3-Asp52-MEPVC-Arg705, TLR3-Glu328MEPVC-Tyr638, and TLR3-Glu323-MEPVC-Arg643 are mainly represented frequently and
found in most of the simulation frames. The TLR3-Asp52-MEPVC-Arg705 is uncovered in
4997 frames, TLR3-Glu328-MEPVC-Tyr638 in 4988, and TLR3-Glu323-MEPVC-Arg643
in 4985 making these interactions ideal for interpreting density distribution of the interactions
on XYZ planes and also appropriate for gaining ideas about conformational changes of the
interacting atoms with respect to each other. As the local structure movements and rotations
are responsible for functional shifts, their understanding in our system is important to be
unveiled. For TLR3-Asp52-MEPVC-Arg705 (Fig.12), the density distribution is not uniform,
dispersed and behave flexibility in affinity on all three axis for the receptor atom. Parallel, the
strength of interaction is also observed affected due to these minor structural movements of
the MEPVC residue atom. Though, the mentioned interaction depicts MEPVC is still within
the vicinity of the TLR3 reference residue and enjoys this interaction flexibility with the said
MEPVC residue during simulation. TLR3-Glu328-MEPVC-Tyr638 interaction (Fig.13) has
less distribution area and has much higher intensity illustrating strong affinity of the
interacting atoms for each other. It also gives an idea of the lesser movements of the atoms
with respect to each other, an indication of a correct system conformation. The distribution
area TLR3-Glu323-MEPVC-Arg643 is much dispersed though high intensity of the
interaction can be seen in close vicinity (Fig.14).

3.13. MEPVC-TLR3 Complex Revealed High Binding Free Energies
The net free energy of binding (ΔTOTAL) in both GB and PB models are revealed favorable
MEPVC-TLR3 complex in pure water. The net GB and PB energy for the MEPVC-TLR3
complex is -53.81 kcal/mol and -89.02 kcal/mol, respectively. To this energy, high
contribution was noticed from gas phase energy (ΔG gas) compared to highly insignificant
contributions from solvation energy (ΔG solv). In GB model, the ΔG gas energy for the
system is -1889.76 kcal/mol whereas in PB model this energy is -1889.76 kcal/mol. The ΔG

solv energy in case of GB is 1835.95 kcal/mol while in case of PB it is 1800.74 kcal/mol. The
electrostatic contribution to the system estimated by MM force field in both methods is
highly favorable to the net energy (i.e. -1752.51 kcal/mol). Likewise, the van der Waals
contribution form MM is also reported significant in system stability (-137.25 kcal/mol). The
electrostatic energy contribution (EGB and EPB) to the ΔG solv is found prime parameter
leading to non-favorable contribution of ΔG solv energy in both techniques. The surface area
energy (ESURF) computed in GB method is -20.22 kca/mol. In PB, ENPOLAR and
EDISPER are the repulsive and attractive free energy and is -17.44 kcal/mol and 0 kcal/mol,
respectively. Individual binding free energy for MEPVC-TLR3 complex, TLR3 receptor,
MEPVC and net energy is tabulated in Table 4.

3.14. Net Energy Decomposition Discovered Hot-spot Residues
The net free energy of the simulated system was subjected to per residues and pairwise
residues decomposition to point residues that contribute majorly in system stabilization and
lower energy. Molecular docking simulation studies demonstrated 64 residues from the TLR3
receptor that are in direct contact with the MEPVC but per residue decomposition assay
illustrated that among the residues only Hie31, Phe55, Glu98, Hie100, Met102, Ile121,
Thr122, Asp124, Glu146, Glu146, Glu174, Ser176, Phe198, Asn200, Ser225, Met249,
Asp251, Tyr254, Tyr273, Phe275, Tyr278, Tyr297, Glu323, Hie324, and Tyr348 are hotspot
as they contribute rigoursly in binding interaction with MEPVC at the docked side. The side
chain of Hie100, Thr122, Asp124, Glu174, Ser176, Tyr254, and Glu323 contribute
significantly in chemical interactions and have energy value in following order: -2.86602
kcal/mol, -3.71782 kcal/mol, -3.77019 kcal/mol, -3.80724 kcal/mol, -2.71475 kcal/mol, 2.40187 kcal/mol, and -3.54158 kcal/mol, respectively. To these TLR3 hotspot residues, the
MEPVC interacting residues were also observed in quite lower energies illustrating high
affinity for the receptor residues for chemical interactions. From MEPVC, ASN633 (-4.11274
kcal/mol), TYR638 (2.83056 kcal/mol), VAL642 (-2.12862 kcal/mol), ARG643 (-6.59981
kcal/mol), GLU675 (-2.57531 kcal/mol), TRP682 (-2.54238 kcal/mol), ARG705 (-3.1088
kcal/mol), and ARG706 (-4.45088 kcal/mol) are favorable residues in stable complex
formation. The hotspot residues for both TLR3 and MEPVC are shown in S-Fig.2.
3.15. Frame –wise Energy Decomposition
The binding free energy of the TLR3-MEPVC complex, TLR3 receptor, MEPVC and the net
system energy is further decomposed into 100 frames extracted from simulation trajectories
(S-Fig.3). This information deemed vital in predicting the simulation time where higher
intermolecular affinity was observed and can guide about the most suitable docked
conformation. In general the complex, receptor and construct energies are higher in PB
compared to GB but for the total energy, the PB energies are quite lower for frames in
contrast to GB. For the complex, the min, max and average binding energy reported are 67264.7 kcal/mol, -66901.5 kcal/mol, and -67069.5 kcal/mol, respectively in GB. The PB
max frame energy is -66751.4 kcal/mol, min is -67120.2 kcal/mol and average is -66921.6
kcal/mol. The GB receptor max is -57111.5 kcal/mol whereas the min is -57381.8 kcal/mol,
and average is -57242 kcal/mol. For PB receptor, max of -56961 kcal/mol of energy was
noticed compared to the min -57249 kcal/mol. The MEPVC is showing high average energy
(-9773.16 kcal/mol in GB and -9742.47 kcal/mol in PB), max (-9672.42 kcal/mol in GB and 9644.54 kcal/mol in PB) and min (-9838.37 kcal/mol in GB and -9811.3 kcal/mol in PB). The
net average energy for frames in GB is -53.8024 kcal /mol (max, -33.978 kcal/mol and min, 72.791 kcal/mol) and in PB is -89.0949 kcal/mol (max, -65.151 kcal/mol and -120.384
kcal/mol).

3.16. Pair-wise Energy Contribution
Pair-wise energy contribution to the net energy of the system was accomplished in order
understand pair residues role from both TLR3 and MEPVC in complex stability. We found
that the Thr122 and Asp124 (-4.56 kcal/mol in GB and -5.45 kcal/mol in PB), Glu174 and
Ser176 (-3.45 kcal/mol in GB and -3.77 kcal/mol in PB), Glu323 and Hie324 (-2.86 kcal/mol
in GB and -3.99 kcal/mol in PB) of TLR3 receptor have high combine contribution to the net
energy. In case of MEPVC, Asn633 and Thr634 (-3.21 kcal/mol in both GB and PB), Val642
and Arg643 (-5,87 kcal/mol in GB and -3.27 kcal/mol in PB) and Arg705 and Arg708 (-2.74
kcal/mol and 2.04 kcal/mol).
4. Conclusions
Taken together, we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein for antigenic peptides and
proposed a MEPVC by means of several computational immunological methods and
biophysical calculations. The outcomes of this study could save time and associated cost that
go into experimental epitope targets study. The MEPVC is capable of activating all
components of the host immune system, have suitable structural and physicochemical
properties. Also, it seems to have very stable dynamics with TLR3 innate immune receptor
and thus has higher chances of presentation to the host immune system. However, additional
in vivo and in vitro experimentations are needed to disclose its potential in fight against
COVID-19.
