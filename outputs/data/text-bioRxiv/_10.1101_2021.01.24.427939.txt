Hihglights
• Transmission of the UK and possibly South African SARS-CoV-2 strains appears substantially
increased compared to other variants
• This could be due, in part, to increased affinity between the variant Spike proteins and ACE2
• We investigated in silico the 3D structure of the Spike-ACE2 complex with a focus on Spike
K417N, E484K and N501Y
• The N501Y substitution is predicted to increase the affinity toward ACE2 (UK strain) with
subsequent enhanced transmissibility and possibly pathogenicity
• Additional substitutions at positions 417 and 484 (South African strain) may pertub the
interaction with ACE2 raising questions about transmissibility and pathogenicity

Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 exploits angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to invade cells. It
has been reported that the UK and South African strains may have higher transmission
capabilities, eventually due to amino acid substitutions on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The
pathogenicity seems modified but is still under investigation. Here we used the experimental
structure of the Spike RBD domain co-crystallized with part of the ACE2 receptor and several
in silico methods to analyze the possible impacts of three amino acid replacements (Spike
K417N, E484K, N501Y) with regard to ACE2 binding. We found that the N501Y replacement
in this region of the interface (present in both UK and South African strains) should be
favorable for the interaction with ACE2 while the K417N and E484K substitutions (South
African) would seem unfavorable. It is unclear if the N501Y substitution in the South African
strain could counterbalance the predicted less favorable (regarding binding) K417N and
E484K Spike replacements. Our finding suggests that, if indeed the South African strain has a
high transmission level, this could be due to the N501Y replacement and/or to substitutions
in regions outside the direct Spike-ACE2 interface.

Introduction

Since the occurrence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a virulent disease
mediated by SARS-CoV-2 initially identified in China, COVID-19 has provoked 2,084,480
deaths with 97,350,867 cases as visualized on Jan 21, 2021 (daily online worldwide data
about Covid-19: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Although the pathogenesis
of this disease remains unclear, in addition to the host response mediated by SARS-CoV-2,
variations

transmission/infectivity and/or severity of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a large, enveloped,
single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus containing four major structural proteins namely
Spike (S) protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein, Envelope (E) protein, and Membrane (M)
protein. The N protein with multifunction is involved in the virus replication, transcription,
and assembly and physically interacts with the viral membrane protein during virion
assembly [1]. The S protein is a large oligomeric transmembrane protein that mediates the
virus entry into host cells. The S protein is composed of two subunits, namely S1 responsible
for receptor binding and S2 that mediates downstream membrane fusion (Figure-1) [2,3].

domains in S1 subunit (NTD, N-terminal domain; RBD, receptor-binding domain; RBM,

For entry into target cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
as a receptor (Figure 2) [4]. Therefore, the S protein determines the infectivity of the virus
and its transmissibility in the host [5]. Indeed, a small, isolated folded domain of the S1
subunit was reported as the receptor-binding domain (RBD), directly interacts and binds
ACE2 during the virus contact with the target cell [6]. This interaction occurs following S
protein cleavage at the S1–S2 junction by a furin-like proprotein convertase (PCs) expressed
by the host cells [6]. The S proteins of both viruses are further processed in the target cell
within the S2 domain at the S2ʹ site, a process that is also necessary for efficient infection
[7].

Figure 2. SARS-CoV-2 exploits the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter target
cells. After receptor binding (1), the virus S protein is cleaved by proteases such as
furin/TMPRSS2 into S1 and S2 subunits (2) that mediates S2-assisted fusion (3) and the
release of the viral genome (4).

Viruses continually change through mutations, a mechanism responsible for the emergence
of new variants. Particularly, RNA viruses have been reported to have elevated mutation
levels as compared to DNA viruses [8,9]. In the surface protein of various viruses such as
Ebola virus [10], Chikungunya virus [11] and the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 [12],

amino acid changes were found to significantly alter viral functions, often resulting in an
increased transmissibility and/or mortality.
In the gene encoding S protein of SARS-CoV-2 various mutations were also reported [13,14]
and recently, the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa have faced a rapid increase in
COVID-19 mediated by new variants that are named in the literature (VOC-202012/01 or
VUI-202012/01 or B.1.1.7 for UK and 501Y.V2 or 20C/501Y.V2B.1.351 for South Africa).
These variants harbor one or several non-synonymous spike mutations including amino-acid
replacements at key sites in the spike RBD domain (K417N, E484K, N501Y for the African
strain [15] and only N501Y in this region of the protein for the UK strain [16]). The
proportion of these variants has increased rapidly and recent observations suggests that
they are significantly more transmissible than previously circulating variants. However, it is
still not fully known if the pathogenicity is increased, although some elements have been
recently released for the UK strain with likely enhanced disease severity [17]. At present, it is
still unclear why some individuals are more susceptible to virus infection and what could be
the role of mutations on ACE2 or on the Spike protein. We attempt here to gain insight into
this protein-protein interaction using various in silico approaches. We specifically focus on
amino acid changes found in the South African and UK strains located in the Spike RBD
domain with a special emphasis on the potential impact of the only three residues (K417,
E484 and N501) that are located directly at the interface with ACE2.

Materials and Methods

We used the crystal structure of the Spike-RBD-ACE2 complex reported by Lan et al. [18] to
map amino acid changes of the African and UK strains in 3D. We took into account the
results of deep experimental mutational scanning of the spike RBD [19] to select the in silico

tools that will be used to compute the energetics of the interaction and during the
interactive structural analysis. COCOMAPS was used to analyze contacts at the biomolecular
interface [20]. Flexibility of the ACE2-Spike complex was investigated with the CABS-flex
package [21,22]. This approach uses a coarse-grained protein model to investigate flexibility
so as to speed up the computations as compared to classical all-atom molecular dynamics
and was shown to provide a similar overview of the system. Restraints were applied to take
into account disulfide bonds present in the structure.
The global interaction energy differences between the initial Spike-ACE2 structure, the UK
and South African strains were investigated with the SPServer [23]. This analysis uses splitstatistical potentials to for instance investigate the interaction energy differences between
native and mutant structures. Split-statistical potentials are knowledge-based potentials that
consider the frequency of pairs of residues in contact, the nature of the amino acids and can
include information about structural environment. In our computations, a Cbeta-Cbeta
distance < 12 Å was used to instigate residues in contact. Different types of scores are
reported. For instance, the score named PAIR is obtained by summing the potential of mean
force with the corresponding subindex of each pair of interacting residues a, b, between the
Spike and ACE2 proteins. It considers amino acid frequencies along distances. The
pyDockEneRes software uses a different scoring function, it was used to provides interaction
energy values of the protein-protein complex partitioned at the residue level [24].
The interactive structural analysis was performed with PyMol (Schrödinger product) and
UCSF ChimeraX (32881101). Amino acid substitutions in the Spike protein were done using
PyMol while a short energy minimization of each modified 3D complex was carried out with
UCSF Chimera.

Results

The crystal structure of the Spike-RBD-ACE2 complex was analyzed using COCOMAPS and
the results of the analysis indicates that 52 residues are involved in the interaction from the
ACE2 side while 46 residues (see below) in the Spike RBD could play a role at the interface.
About 1688 Å2 is buried upon complex formation and the buried polar surface represents
about 58% of the interface while the non-polar buried surface involves about 42% of the
interface. Thus, a variety of non-covalent interactions are found between the amino acids of
both, the Spike protein and the ACE2 receptor. The identified residues on the Spike protein
that have some contacts with ACE2 within a maximum distance of 8 Å from the ACE2
interface involve the following 46 amino-acids: R403, D405, E406, K417, Y421, N439, K444,
V445, G446, G447, N448, Y449, Y453, R454, L455, F456, R457, Y473, Q474, A475, G476,
S477, T478, E484, G485, F486, N487, C488, Y489, F490, P491, L492, Q493, S494, Y495, G496,
F497, Q498, P499, T500, N501, G502, V503, G504, Y505, Q506 (here the strength or
energetics of the interaction is not considered).
Protein flexibility was then investigated with CABS-Flex. The complex was simulated using
the crystal structure as starting point (Figure 3).

Figure-3. Fluctuation plot. The residue fluctuation profile (RMSF in Å) as computed with
CABS-Flex for the ACE2-Spike RBD protein complex is shown (ACE2, in grey and the Spike
domain, in blue). Substituted residues in this region of Spike in the UK strain (N501) and in
the South African strain (K417N, E484K, N501Y) are shown in magenta.

The main global information that we obtained here is that many segments at the interface
are relatively rigid, as expected, at least when the two proteins are bound. Yet, a peptide at
the interface between Spike residues 475 and 487 is predicted to be more flexible
(essentially a loop region) than the other interface regions. Some other segments on both
proteins located relatively far away from the interface (essentially loops) are also predicted
to be flexible. Simulations of the variant models do provide similar outputs (i.e., the
substitutions did not enhance or reduce significantly the flexibility or rigidity of the interface,
data not shown).
We then investigated the global binding scores for the original Spike-ACE2 structure as
present in the PDB file and for the UK and South African strains with the SPServer. The PAIR
score gives some insights about the energetics of the interaction. It was found to be more
favorable for the UK strain (N501Y) than for the initial structure (N at position 501). But the
predicted global interaction score between the Spike and ACE2 proteins seems less favorable

for the South African strain (K417N, E484K, N501Y) than for the original input structure or
for the UK strain.
In a following step, we predicted the interaction energy of the Spike RBD-ACE2 proteinprotein complex partitioned at the residue level using pyDockEneRes. On the Spike RBD
domain, the top residues that are predicted to have favorable interaction energy values with
the region of ACE2 that binds the RBD are (from the most favorable according to this
method, values of about -12 kcal/mol to less favorable but still with some contributions
around -1 kcal/mol): F486, F456, Y505, Y489, R403, K417, Y453, R408, K444, N501, Q498,
Q506, and A475 (Figure 4). Some other residues are present at the interface on the Spike
protein but the computed interaction energy values were outside our selected range (e.g.,
Spike Q493, Y449, L455, G485, or G496). Of interest, in the list of residues predicted to be
important for the interaction with ACE2, Spike N501 (present in both the UK and South
African strains) and Spike K417 (South African strain) are identified while E484 (the third
substitution in this region of the Spike protein in the South African strain) is not predicted to
be a major residue for the interaction. On ACE2, the top key predicted residues involved
(from very favorable energy values around -7.7 kcal/mol to less favorable, around -1
kcal/mol) are: T27, Y83, K353, M82, D30, H34, D38, D355, E329, L45, and L79 (see Fig. 4).
Here also, a few extra residues are visible at the interface (like ACE2 Y41 or K31) but the
computed energy values were too weak considering the selected threshold value of about -1
kcal/mol.

Figure 4. 3D structure of the complex. The crystal structure of the Spike RBD and part of the
ACE2 receptor interacting with the Spike is shown as cartoon diagram. The Spike domain is in
blue while the ACE2 domain is in grey. The Spike side chains of residues predicted to be
important (with our in silico protocol, see the Method section) for the interaction with ACE2
are shown in red. The UK and/or South African strains are highlighted by coloring the amino
acid changes in this region in magenta. All the Spike side chains shown should have favorable
interaction energies with ACE2 but E484 that is predicted to have very weak or unfavorable
interactions). On the ACE2 side, the side chains that are predicted to contribute favorably to
the interaction with the Spike RBD are shown in lemon. Only ACE Y41 seems to have very
limited interactions with the Spike protein while, when the Spike protein carries a Y at
position 501, ACE2 Y41 has then some favorable interaction energy values with the Spike.

If we then consider the three residue replacements of interest in the present analysis
(N501Y, K417N, E484K), we observe that N501 (UK and South African strains) is solvent
exposed on the free Spike protein and becomes essentially buried upon ACE2 binding. N501
is located in a loop structure and could be replaced by a Y without creating folding problems.
Some flexibility is present there suggesting that a larger Y residue could be accommodated
(Figure 3). Some weak hydrogen bonds are possible with ACE2 K353 (a residue found to have
some contributions with the pyDockEneRes tool) and ACE2 Y41 (not listed in our analysis as

the computed contribution with this method is too weak considering our threshold). The
contribution of N501 to the interaction with ACE2 is predicted to be around -1.6 kcal/mol
but when a Y is present at this position, the variant residue has a predicted interaction
energy with ACE2 of about -3.5 kcal/mol. On the graphics display, we note that the newly
introduced Y501 side chain should make many favorable interactions with ACE2, like for
example with ACE2 Y41 via a Pi-stacking, with ACE2 K353 via a cation-Pi interaction and
possibly with ACE2 D38 via a hydrogen bond. This type of non-covalent interactions (Pistacking and cation-Pi) in the variant should be very favorable for the interaction and much
stronger in strengths as compared to the initial N residue. It is important to note that in fact
such energetics terms are in general underestimated or not considered by many scoring
functions as very difficult to calibrate.
Spike K417 is located at the N-term of a short helix, it is solvent exposed and becomes
partially buried upon binding to ACE2. It is in a somewhat rigid region of the interface
(Figures 3 and 4). It can however be replaced by N (South African strain) without creating
folding problems and should not destabilize the Spike protein. It forms a salt-bridge with
ACE2 D30 and should contribute favorably to the interaction as its predicted energy value is
around -3 kcal/mol. Upon replacement by a N, the contribution of position 417 to the
interaction with ACE2 is less favorable (loss of salt-bridge) than with the K and is computed
to be -1.3 kcal/mol. Some weak hydrogen bonds could still be possible, most likely with ACE2
H34 and D30.
E484 is located in a loop structure and is solvent exposed. This segment is somewhat more
flexible than the remaining regions of the interface (Figures 3 and 4). It remains solvent
exposed upon binding to the ACE2 protein. Its contribution to the interaction energy is

predicted to be relatively weak in spite the presence of the nearby ACE2 K31 (most likely
because of the distance between the two charge centers is around 4.4 Å (slightly higher than
4 Å or less, commonly found in energetically stronger salt-bridges) and as the interaction is
fully solvent exposed). E484 could be replaced by a K in the Spike protein without creating
folding problem. Yet, a K at this position in the ACE2-Spike complex is predicted to be less
favorable than a E with regard to the interaction with ACE2 (about +1.9 kcal/mol, possibly
the proximity with ACE2 K31).

Discussion

Amino acid changes in a protein can have numerous impacts, from folding problems to
modulation of intermolecular interactions with ligands or protein partners. Several key
structural properties are known to play a role here, such as the type of amino acid
substitution (conservative replacement or not), the location in the protein structure (e.g.,
the change takes place in a loop or in secondary structure elements, the residue is buried or
solvent exposed), the residue is inside a catalytic site or within a protein-ligand interface, the
replaced residue is in a flexible or rigid region among many others [25–32]. Different types of
computational tools (https://www.vls3d.com/), all with strengths and weaknesses, can be
used to investigate the possible impacts of amino acid replacements on the structure and
function of a protein when a 3D structure is available or can be predicted [25–32]. It is
recommended to use different tools that apply different types of algorithms so as to gain
some “consensus” insights about the amino-acid replacement [25]. Further, when
experimental data are available, it is obviously of interest to select methods that can at least
reproduce such data. The present investigation benefits from the recently published Spike

mutagenesis study and the impacts on ACE2 binding [19]. Among the experimental data
reported in that study, we were particularly interested in the measured affinity of the Spike
N501F protein mutant with ACE2 as it involves residue 501 and as the affinity was assessed
in a purified binding assay (most other affinity evaluation were performed using highthroughput affinity measurements that could be less accurate than measurements carried
out in purified systems). Experimentally, it was found that the Spike N501F protein has
increased affinity for ACE2. Interestingly, most in silico tools that we tested to compute
stability changes at protein interfaces (ΔΔG) could not reproduce this measurement. We
noted that the SPServer and pyDockEneRes tools were able to output data consistent with
this high-quality N501F experimental result. Our selection does not mean that these in silico
approaches will systematically performed better than the other methods in all cases but that
they are interesting for this specific study. Further, while these tools have been assessed
extensively by the authors, we still decided to compare the results of these two methods on
five protein-protein interactions selected from the SKEMPI database [33] (thus with
measured experimental stability changes upon mutations) to gain confidence in the meaning
of the computed scores (data not shown). That is, all methods that predict such stability
changes are compared with experimental values and correlations between the prediction
and the measured values are reported. This is of importance but equally important is to gain
insight about the type of substitutions that are well covered by the methods (e.g., a method
recognizes or not a salt-bridge, the energetics make sense as compared to what is seen on
the computer display, etc. [25].
Several crystal structures of the ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) have
been reported (PDB IDs: 6LZG, 6M17, 6M0J) [34] to help the investigation the specific
residues at the interface. For example, several polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene have been

proposed to reduce the affinity toward the Spike protein, with subsequent lower
susceptibility to infection [35]. Also, structural and in silico analyses of ACE2 polymorphisms
have been carried out on the ACE2 region that directly interacts with the Spike glycoprotein
[36]. In that study, the authors found, for example, that two substitutions in ACE2 at
positions 19 and 26 could modulate the affinity for the Spike protein (ACE2 position 19, fully
solvent exposed, the S19P is common in African people and the substitution was suggested
to protect individuals (reduced affinity for Spike) and a cleavage site of the ACE2 precursor;
ACE2 position 26, fully solvent exposed, the K26R is common in European people, the
mutation may increase affinity of ACE2 towards Spike). However, in our hands, it would
seem that the ACE2 K26R may only have minor roles with regard to Spike binding. In our
investigation, residue K26 was not found to be a major player that strongly contributes to
the stability of the interface because it is at about 8 Å from the Spike protein in all the
available experimental structures of the complex and in fact tends to point away from the
Spike surface (of course some side chain flexibility is likely but in the available X-ray
structures, around ACE2 K26 we note the Spike N487 side chain, at about 7.8 Å, much too far
for hydrogen bonds and the Spike K417 side chain, at about 7Å with possibly some
electrostatic repulsion). Some long distance electrostatic interactions may play a role in the
pre-orientation of the two binding partners when ACE2 K26 is replaced by arginine (e.g.,
could we have some improved hydrogen bond networks due to the amino-acid substitution
with water molecules at the interface?). Another alternative could be that, as ACE2 K26
makes a salt-bridge with ACE2 E22 and polar interactions with ACE2 N90, the K26R
substitution stabilizes locally this region of ACE2 (with possibly creating another salt-bridge
with the nearby ACE2 E23 not possible when ACE2 at position 26 is a K, data not shown) and
contributes to a more favorable change in free energy of binding with the Spike protein.

Some additional investigations are needed to clarify these observations. Some other studies
investigating genetic variations in ACE2 suggest that amino acid changes in regions that are
relatively far away from the interaction site for the Spike protein could also alter the
recognition via various molecular mechanisms [37].
The main focus of the present study is the Spike protein. For this macromolecule, some
mutations have also been reported; some could increase the infectivity of the virus. For
example, the Spike D614G substitution [14,38] seems to increase affinity although this
residue is not present at the Spike-ACE2 interface but at a Spike protomer-protomer
interface. Here, we were interested in the analysis of one or three amino acid substitutions
as found in the UK strain and South African strain, respectively, with a special emphasis on
residues that are directly present on the Spike receptor-binding domain, at the interface
with ACE2. We wanted to gain some insights about the putative impacts of these
substitutions on the interaction with the ACE2 receptor. Our in silico results were also
investigated in the light of recently reported experimental mutagenesis data [19].
Experimentally, amino acid can be substituted and the expression levels monitored (e.g.,
notion of stability problem if for instance the mutant protein is expressed at very low level).
Such behavior can be estimated in silico. Further, when a mutant protein is expressed, its
interaction with a protein partner can be evaluated. This event can also be investigated to
some extent in silico. In all cases, it is important to note that both, experimental data and in
silico predictions can be misleading and as such results should be investigated with cautions.
In the previously reported mutagenesis study mentioned above [19], it was found that the
replacement of Spike N501 by a F enhances ACE2 affinity while having no effects on
expression. This observation is expected for the N501Y substitution although the

measurements were not performed in purified system. Overall, these experimental data are
in agreement with the present computer analysis. The replacement of K417 by N (South
African strain) seems relatively neutral in term of protein expression level while not very
favorable for the interaction with ACE2 [19], also in agreement with our computer
evaluation. The E484K replacement was not found to change the expression level,
suggesting, as observed in our structural analysis, that a K could be present in this position of
the Spike protein. Yet, the substitution with a K seems experimentally to slightly enhance the
affinity towards the ACE2 receptor while we computed that a K at this position should be
less favorable than a E. The differences between the computed values and the experimental
observation could be due to inaccuracies in the scoring functions and unexpected flexibility
at the interface (yet, introducing flexibility with in silico approaches can lead to nonsense
energy values). It is also important to note that the substitutions in the South African and UK
strains outside the interface area with ACE2 could play a role in affinity and/or on
transmission/infectivity. Yet, when focusing only at the Spike RBD-ACE2 interface, the
present in silico predictions and interactive structural analysis suggest that the key player
residue in term of enhanced affinity is the N501Y replacement. Our observation applies
essentially to the UK strain while additional work is required to gain insights over the South
African strain because in our hand, looking only at the interface, it would seem that the
K417N and E484K substitutions are not favorable for the interaction with ACE2. For the time
being, we do not know if the N501Y alone could counterbalance the predicted unfavorable
Spike K417N and E484K amino acid replacements. Considering the clinical observations
about the South African strain and potentials greater risks relative to the UK strain, as it is
definitively unclear that the affinity between the Spike and ACE2 is significantly enhanced
(according to our predictions), then, danger is due to some amino acid changes (e.g., Spike

residue 484 in this region of the protein and possibly elsewhere) that impede recognition by
neutralizing antibodies [39,40]. For the UK strain, could it be that the enhanced affinity to
ACE2 not only increases transmissibility but also disease severity (not only due the increased
number of infected individuals) as suggested after comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and
other human coronaviruses [41]?
