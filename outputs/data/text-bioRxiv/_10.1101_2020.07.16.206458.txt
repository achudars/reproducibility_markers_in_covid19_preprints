Abstract: Antiviral strategies to inhibit Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2

50

(SARS-CoV2) and the pathogenic consequences of COVID-19 are urgently required. Here we

51

demonstrate that the NRF2 anti-oxidant gene expression pathway is suppressed in biopsies

52

obtained from COVID-19 patients. Further, we uncover that NRF2 agonists 4-octyl-itaconate (4-

53

OI) and the clinically approved dimethyl fumarate (DMF) induce a cellular anti-viral program,

54

which potently inhibits replication of SARS-CoV2 across cell lines. The anti-viral program

55

extended to inhibit the replication of several other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex

56

Virus-1 and-2, Vaccinia virus, and Zika virus through a type I interferon (IFN)-independent

57

mechanism. In addition, induction of NRF2 by 4-OI and DMF limited host inflammatory

58

responses to SARS-CoV2 infection associated with airway COVID-19 pathology. In conclusion,

59

NRF2 agonists 4-OI and DMF induce a distinct IFN-independent antiviral program that is

60

broadly effective in limiting virus replication and suppressing the pro-inflammatory responses of

61

human pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV2.

Introduction:

72

The 2020 SARS-CoV2 pandemic emphasizes the urgent need to identify cellular factors and

73

pathways that can be targeted by new broad-spectrum anti-viral therapies. Viral infections

74

usually cause disease in humans through both direct cytopathogenic effects and through

75

excessive inflammatory responses of the infected host. This also seems to be the case with

76

SARS-CoV2 as COVID-19 patients develop cytokine storms that are very likely to contribute to,

77

if not drive, immunopathology and severe disease(1, 2). For these reasons, anti-viral therapies

78

must aim to not only inhibit viral replication but also to limit inflammatory responses of the host.

79

Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (NRF2) functions as a cap´n´collar basic leucine

80

zipper family of transcription factors characterized structurally by the presence of NRF2-ECH

81

homology domains(3). At homeostasis, NRF2 is kept inactive in the cytosol by its inhibitor

82

protein KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1), which targets NRF2 for proteasomal

83

degradation(4). In response to oxidative stress, KEAP1 is inactivated and NRF2 is released to

84

induce NRF2-responsive genes. In general, the genes under the control of NRF2 protect against

85

stress-induced cell death and NRF2 has thus been suggested as the master regulator of tissue

86

damage during infection(5). Importantly, NRF2 is now demonstrated as an important regulator of

87

the inflammatory response(6, 7) and functions as a transcriptional repressor of inflammatory

88

genes, most notably interleukin (IL-) 1b, in murine macrophages(8). Recent reports have now

89

demonstrated that NRF2 is induced by several cell derived metabolites including itaconate and

90

fumarate, to limit inflammatory responses to stimulation of TLR signaling with

91

lipopolysaccharide stimulation(9). The chemically synthesized and cell-permeable derivative of

92

itaconate, 4-octyl-itaconate (4-OI) was then demonstrated to be a very potent NRF2 inducer(9).

93

Of special interest is the derivative of fumarate, dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a US Food and Drug

94

Administration (FDA) approved drug, which is used as an anti-inflammatory therapeutic in

95

multiple sclerosis (MS) and demonstrated, at least in animal models, a potent capacity to

96

suppress pathogenic inflammation through a Nrf2-dependent mechanism(10, 11).

97

Besides limiting the inflammatory response to LPS, induction of NRF2 by 4-OI also inhibits the

98

Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) antiviral pathway along with interferon (IFN)

99

stimulated gene expression(12). In opposition to this anti-viral effect of NRF2 on the IFN-

100

response a recent single-cell RNA-seq analysis has demonstrated that NRF2 gene expression

101

signatures correlated negatively with susceptibility to HSV1 infection (13). If NRF2 agonists can

102

be used to limit viral replication of SARS-CoV2 or other pathogenic viruses is, however, not

103

known.

104

Here we demonstrate that expression of NRF2-dependent genes is suppressed in biopsies from

105

COVID-19 patients and that treatment of cells with NRF2 agonists 4-OI and DMF induces a

106

strong anti-viral program that limits SARS-CoV2 replication. The anti-viral effect of activating

107

NRF2 extended to other pathogenic viruses including Herpes Simplex Virus-1 and-2 (HSV-1 and

108

HSV-2), Vaccinia Virus (VACV), and Zika Virus (ZIKV). Further, 4-OI and DMF limited the

109

release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to SARS-CoV2 infection and to virus-derived

110

ligands through a mechanism that limits IRF3 dimerization. In summary, we demonstrate that

111

NRF2 agonists are plausible broad-spectrum anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents and we

112

suggest a repurposing of the already clinically approved DMF for the treatment of SARS-CoV2.

Results

117

NRF2 dependent anti-oxidant response is suppressed in COVID-19 patient biopsies

118

To identify host factors or pathways that are important for controlling SARS-CoV2 infection,

119

publicly available transcriptome data sets including transcriptome analysis of lung biopsies from

120

COVID-19 patients were analyzed using differential expression analysis(14). Here, genes linked

121

with inflammatory and anti-viral pathways, including RIG-I receptor and Toll-like receptor

122

signaling, were highly enriched in COVID-19 lung patient samples, whereas genes associated

123

with the NRF2 dependent anti-oxidant response were highly suppressed (Fig. 1a-c). That NRF2-

124

induced genes are repressed during SARS-CoV2 infections was supported by re-analysis of

125

another data-set builing on transcriptome analysis of lung autopsies obtained from five individual

126

COVID-19 patients (Desai et al., 2020) (Fig. 1d). Further, that the NRF2-pathway is repressed

127

during infection with SARS-CoV2 was also supported by in vitro experiments where the

128

expression of NRF2-inducible proteins Heme Oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H quinone

129

oxydoreducatse 1 (NqO1) was repressed in SARS-CoV2 infected Vero hTMPRSS2 cells while

130

the protein levels of canonical anti-viral transcription factors such as STAT1 and IRF3 seemed

131

unaffected (Fig. S1). These data indicate that SARS-CoV2 targets the anti-oxidant NRF2

132

pathway and thus suggests that the NRF2 pathway restricts SARS-CoV2 replication.

153

NRF2 agonists 4-OI and dimethyl fumarate are strong inhibitors of SARS-CoV2

154

replication

155

Considering that NRF2 suppresses anti-viral IFN-responses, it was surprising to discover that

156

treatment of Vero cells with 4-OI generated before infection with SARS-CoV2 (strain #291.3

157

FR-4286 isolated from a patient in Germany) resulted in a remarkable reduction in SARS-CoV2

158

RNA levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a+b) while not affecting cell viability as

159

determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (Fig. S2). Further, subsequent release of

160

progeny SARS-CoV2 virus particles to the cell supernatant was equally decreased by 4-OI

161

treatment as measured by TCID50 assay to quantify virus by dilution of virus-induced

162

cytopathogenic effects and by plaque assay (Fig. 2c-f). The reduced viral replication led to

163

reduced virus-induced cytotoxicity of the infected Vero cells determined by lactate

164

dehydrogenase release assay and by immunoblotting for cleaved Caspase 3 and Poly(ADP-

165

Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP-1), which are hallmark indicators of apoptosis(15) (Fig. 2g+h).

166

Interestingly, the observation that the NRF2 pathway is inhibited in response to SARS-CoV-2

167

infection could be recapitulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells as demonstrated by both the

168

basal decrease in NRF2-driven proteins HO-1 and NqO1 and their incapacity to be induced by

169

Nrf2 agonist 4-OI (Fig. 2h). The effect of 4-OI was also retained in the lung cancer cell line

170

Calu-3, where SARS-CoV2 RNA levels were reduced by >2-logs (Fig. 2i), while release of

171

progeny virus was reduced by > 6-logs based on TCID50 analysis of cell supernatants (Fig.

172

2j+k). In the immortalized human epithelial cell line NuLi, total infection levels were relatively

173

low compared to what we could observe in Calu3 and Vero cells but 4-OI treatment still reduced

174

SARS-CoV2 RNA levels and release of progeny virus (Fig. 2l+m). We further tested the anti-

175

viral effect towards SARS-CoV2 in primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures (Fig. 2n).

176

Here, 4-OI treatment also significantly reduced viral RNA levels (Fig. 2o). Interestingly, when

177

treating Calu3 cells with DMF, another known NRF2 inducer and a clinically approved drug in

178

the first-line-of treatment of multiple sclerosis, we could also observe an anti-viral effect toward

179

SARS-CoV2 replication similar in magnitude as what we had observed with 4-OI (Fig 2p-q) as

180

well as a reduced but significant effect when using Vero cells (Fig. 2r). To further evaluate if the

181

NRF2/KEAP1 axis controls an anti-viral pathway effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV2

182

replication, we used genetic activation of NRF2 by silencing of KEAP1. This approach

183

supported the 4-OI data as silencing of KEAP1 led to suppressed replication of SARS-CoV2 in

184

Calu3 cells by qPCR analysis, immunoblotting, and TCID50 analysis (Fig. 2s-u). Finally, the

185

anti-viral effect of SARS-CoV2 was not isolated to this particular isolate as the effect of 4-OI

186

was reproduced using a different SARS-CoV2 isolate obtained in Japan(16) (Fig. 2v+x). These

187

data demonstrate that NRF2 inducers 4-OI and DMF induce potent anti-viral responses that

188

efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV2 replication across multiple cellular systems.

221

Activation of NRF2 with 4-OI broadly inhibits viral replication through an IFN-

222

independent pathway

223

The anti-viral effect of 4-OI was not restricted to SARS-CoV2 but also extended to other human

224

pathogenic viruses. Using the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT as a model of Herpes Simplex

225

Virus (HSV) type 1 and 2 we could observe that treatment with 4-OI reduced both the release of

226

progeny virus, the cellular content of virus RNA determined by RNA sequence analysis, and

227

viral protein as determined by both immunoblotting and flow cytometry (Fig. 3a-e and Fig. S3).

228

By contrast, the expression of NRF2-inducible HO-1, NqO1, and Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)

229

was highly increased in response to 4-OI treatment (Fig. 2c and Fig. S3). The anti-viral effect of

230

4-OI was at least partially dependent on NRF2 as silencing hereof by siRNA clearly reduced the

231

suppression of HSV1 infection by 4-OI (Fig. 2f-g).

232

Vaccinia virus (VACV) belongs to the family of human pathogenic poxviruses. We used HaCaT

233

cells, but also bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), to test if the anti-viral effect of 4-

234

OI extended to these viruses. Here we could observe that both HaCaT cells and BMDCs became

235

highly resistant to infection with VACV when these were pre-treated with 4-OI as measured by

236

plaque assay and flow cytometry (Fig. 2h-n). This seemed also to be the case for another

237

poxvirus Ectromelia virus (ECTV) as assesses by confocal imaging (Fig. 2k-l). For both HSV1

238

and VACV the anti-viral effect of 4-OI was extended to other cell type including murine cancer

239

cell line 4T1 and human renal carcinoma 786-O cells (Fig. S4). Interestingly, the anti-viral effect

240

of 4-OI was not extended to infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVd51M) emphasizing

241

that the anti-viral program induced by 4-OI effectively inhibits replication of many, but not all,

242

viruses (Fig. S4). The anti-viral effect of 4-OI relied on intracellular restriction of replication,

243

since viral entry was not affected by 4-OI treatment – if anything it seemed to be slightly

244

increased (Fig. S5).

245

To determine if the anti-viral effect of 4-OI extended to an in vivo model of viral pathogenesis,

246

female C57BL6J mice were treated with 4-OI prior to vaginal inoculation with HSV; pre-treatment

247

with 4-OI decreased disease progression (Fig. S6), an effect that was enhanced in mice deficient

248

in STING (TMEM173–/–) most likely to due to the pro-viral effect 4-OI has on the STING signaling

249

pathway(12, 17), which is eliminated in these mice.

250

Finally, we tested the efficacy of 4-OI on Zika virus, an important human pathogenic virus

251

causing mild symptoms in the competent adult but severe disease when transmitted in utero(18).

252

Here, we could demonstrate that the anti-viral program induced by 4-OI reduced replication of

253

Zika virus in the human lung cancer cell line A549 and in the human liver cell line Huh-7 (Fig.

254

2o-p). Given that Vero cells are deficient in type I IFN(19), this suggested that the inhibitory

255

effect of 4-OI was actually independent of type I IFN signaling. To address this possibility, we

256

used either HaCaT cells deficient in IFN alpha receptor 2 (IFNAR2), Signal Transducer and

257

Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1), both of which is necessary for type I IFN-signaling(20);

258

or deficient in STING, which is central to type I IFN-response to DNA viruses. Here, cells were

259

treated with 4-OI, followed by infection with HSV1 and VACV. Replication of both viruses was

260

inhibited by 4-OI in STAT1 KO cells and for HSV1 also in STING KO cells as measured by

261

plaque assay and expression of viral proteins by immunoblotting and flow cytometry (Fig. S7).

262

In conclusion, 4-OI induces an anti-viral program that operates independently of IFN signaling

263

(Fig. S7).

264

To examine what general pathways are affected by 4-OI treatment either alone or during

265

infection that could predict the antiviral mode of action itaconate, we treated HaCaT cells with 4-

266

OI before infection with HSV-1. RNA was then collected and analysed by RNA sequencing.

267

Pathway analysis was then used to compare untreated cells to 4-OI treated cells either with or

268

without infection with HSV-1. This analysis identified several pathways that were either induced

269

or repressed by 4-OI treatment while re-confirming that IFN-signaling pathways was repressed

270

by 4-OI (Fig. S8). Amongst the top up-regulated genes induced by 4-OI was the heme

271

oxygensase-1, an enzyme canonicaly involved in stress detoxification, also reported to have

272

antiviral activity against amongst others Zika, Dengue and Ebola viruses (21-23). To assess

273

whether, HO-1 had any antiviral activity in our cellular system, Vero hTMPRSS2 and Calu-3

274

cells were either transfected with an overexpression plasmid encoding HO-1 or genetically

275

silenced for KEAP1 and HO-1 by siRNA, respectively before infection with SARS-CoV-2. None

of the treatments (HO-1 overexpression or silencing) really altered SARS-CoV-2

277

infection/replication suggesting of an HO-1-independent antiviral program induced by NRF2

278

(Fig. S9).

279

In an attempt to pin-point the anti-viral mode of action of 4-OI, we also used microscope-based

280

analysis of morphology by cell-paint technology (Fig. S10). With this analysis we are able to

281

compare morphological changes in cells treated with 4-OI to cells treated with compounds that

282

have known cellular targets and with cells treated with other compounds with reported anti-viral

283

activity towards SARS-CoV2 including Remdesivir and Hydroxychloroquine(24, 25). In this

284

analysis, 4-OI was determined to have an low but significant morphological activity whitout loss

285

of cell viability. Interestingly, the activity of 4-OI did not seem to overlap with other compound

286

with known perturbation in cell morphology including Rapamycin, Bafilomycin, Tunicamycin,

287

Cyclohexamide, Emetine, Mitomycin, or Doxorubicin. Interestingly, there was also no

288

observable overlab with the activity profile of Remdesivir or hydroxychloroquine indicating that

289

the anti-viral mode of action of 4-OI is distinct from known anti-viral mechanisms.

4-OI and DMF suppress the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV2

310

In COVID-19, an uncontrolled pro-inflammatory cytokine storm contributes to disease

311

pathogenesis and lung damage (26). For this reason, we investigated if 4-OI and DMF could

312

inhibit expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV2. In Calu-3 cells,

313

infection with SARS-CoV2 increased the expression of IFNB1, C-X-C motif chemokine 10

314

(CXCL10), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFA), IL-1B and C-C chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5).

315

Interestingly, this was abolished by pretreatment with 4-OI thus severely reducing the pro-

316

inflammatory response to SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 4a-b). By contrast, expression of the NRF2

317

inducible gene HMOX1 was highly increased in response to 4-OI treatment (Fig. 4c). The

318

potential anti-inflammatory effect of 4-OI in this context was supported when using HAE

319

cultures. Here, treatment with 4-OI also reduced the expression of IFNB1, CXCL10, TNFa, and

320

CCL5 in the context of SARS-CoV2 infection (Fig. 4d-e), while increasing the expression of the

321

NRF2 inducible gene HMOX1 (Fig. 4f). A similar pattern was seen in experiments where Calu3

322

cells were treated with DMF before SARS-CoV2 infection. Here, IFNB1, CXCL10 and CCL5

323

mRNA levels were highly reduced in DMF treated cells while TNFA mRNA levels seemed

324

unaffected (Fig. 4g+h). By contrast, treatment with DMF increased the mRNA expression levels

325

of NRF2 inducible gene HMOX1 (Fig. 4i). As inflammatory responses often stem from immune

326

cells we also tested the effect of 4-OI on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)

327

harvested from healthy donors. Although stimulation of PBMCs with SARS-CoV2 yielded a

328

very weak induction of CXCL10 compared to sendai virus (SeV) infection, and no detectable

329

induction of other cytokines, 4-OI treatment also reduced CXCL10 mRNA levels in this context

330

(Fig. 4j). Further, when using PBMCs harvested from four individual patients with severe

331

COVID-19 and admitted to hospital Intensive Care Units (ICUs), we could conclude that in three

332

out of four patients, expression levels of CXCL10 were increased when compared to healthy

333

controls; and that in all four patients, these levels were strongly reduced to or below normal

334

when treating the PBMCs with 4-OI (Fig. 4k) indicating that 4-OI is able to relieve

335

inflammatory responses induced by SARS-CoV2 in PBMCs in vivo. That CXCL10 levels is a

336

relevant readout in SARS-CoV2 was recently supported by a report by Cheemarla et al., 2020

337

(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.20109306) demonstrating that CXCL10 expression is increased

338

in the upper airways of patients infected with SARS-CoV2.

339

The observed decrease in anti-viral and pro-inflammatory responses could possibly be explained

340

by the 4-OI mediated reduction in cellular viral RNA with subsequent reduced induction of

341

cytokines through cellular RNA sensors such as RIG-I. We therefore investigated the effect of 4-

342

OI on the induction of IFN and of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) responses activated by a sequence

343

optimized RIG-I agonist M8(27). Interestingly, 4-OI treatment reduced IFN-responses induced by

344

this RIG-I agonist M8 (Fig 4l-m), through an effect linked to the inhibition of Interferon

345

Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) dimerization but not of upstream phosphorylation of Tank Binding

346

Kinase 1 (TBK1) or of IRF3 expression itself (Fig 4n). Importantly, NRF2 expression itself was

347

closely associated with the inhibition of IRF3 dimerization and host antiviral gene expression,

348

since NRF2 silencing by siRNA was sufficient to restore IRF3 dimerization and limit the inhibitory

349

effect of 4-OI (Fig. 4n-o). When using the constitutively active form of IRF3, IRF3(5D) (28), 4-

350

OI was still able to block IRF3 dimerization, and again, this effect was eliminated when NRF2

351

expression was suppressed by siRNA (Fig 4p-q). These data indicate that an NRF2 inducible and

352

dependent mechanism targets the induction of IFN by inhibition of IRF3 dimerization. This

353

phenomenon is likely to add to the inhibition of SARS-CoV2 induced cytokine release we could

354

observe when using NRF2 agonists. We have previously reported that 4-OI inhibits the expression

355

of STING, which is important for the induction of the IFN-response in cells stimulated with

356

cytosolic DNA(12). In line, 4-OI inhibited the IFN-response to HSV1 infection and to stimulation

357

with STING agonists dsDNA and cGAMP (Fig. 4R-T).

Discussion

388

Altogether, this study demonstrated that the expression of NRF2 dependent anti-oxidant genes was

389

significantly inhibited in COVID-19 patients, and that the NRF2 agonists 4-OI and DMF inhibited

390

both SARS-CoV2 replication, as well as the expression of associated inflammatory markers. The

391

ability of these NRF2 inducers to also reduce potentially pathogenic IFN- and inflammatory

392

responses while retaining their anti-viral properties is unique to these compounds and promotes

393

their applicability to prevent virus-induced pathology. That NRF2 might be a natural regulator of

394

IFN-responses in the airway epithelium is supported by a recent report demonstrating that NRF2

395

activity is high while IFN activity is low in the bronchial epithelium(29). As DMF is currently

396

used as an anti-inflammatory drug in relapsing-remitting MS, this drug could be easily repurposed

397

and tested in clinical trials to test its ability to limit SARS-CoV2 replication and inflammation-

398

induced pathology in COVID-19 patients. Our observation that 4-OI strongly inhibits the IFN-

399

response to both cytosolic DNA and d RNA, which are canonical anti-viral pathways, but still

400

retain its ability to block viral replication also suggests a spectrum of unidentified cellular

401

programs that are inducible through NRF2 and efficiently restrict viral replication independently

402

of IFNs. This is supported by already mentioned negative correlation between expression of

403

NRF2-inducible genes and infection with HSV1 discovered by Wyler et al., through single cell

404

transcriptome analysis(13). Similarly to how IFNs block viral replication through the induction of

405

hundreds of effector IFN-stimulated effector genes, the NRF2 controlled anti-viral program might

406

also consists of a myriad of mechanisms that restrict viral replication each by targeting distinct

407

stages of viral replication.

408

Future studies will determine if patients developing severe SARS-CoV2 pathology also have an

409

underlying NRF2 deficiency, leading to reduced control of viral replication, coupled with excess

410

inflammatory responses. Further, it could be valuable to investigate if patients already in DMF

411

therapy have altered susceptibility to SARS-CoV2 infection and if those infected have milder

412

symptoms and reduced cytokine load. Finally, the fact that 4-OI effectively limited replication of

413

several human pathogenic viruses demonstrated that 4-OI, or related chemically modified

414

compounds such as DMF, could be evaluated as broad-spectrum anti-viral agents for protection

415

against seasonal and pandemic viral infections in general.
