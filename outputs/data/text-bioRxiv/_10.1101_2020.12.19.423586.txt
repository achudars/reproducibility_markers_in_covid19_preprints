Abstract
Comprehensive libraries of plasmids for SARS-CoV-2 proteins with various tags (e.g. Strep,
HA, Turbo) are now available. They enable the identification of numerous potential proteinprotein interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and host proteins. To facilitate further
cellular investigations, notably by imaging techniques, we present here a large library of
SARS CoV-2 protein constructs fused with green and red fluorescent proteins and their initial
characterization in various human cell lines including lung epithelial cell models (A549, BEAS2B), as well as in budding yeast. The localization of a few SARS-CoV-2 proteins matches their
proposed interactions with host proteins. These include the localization of Nsp13 to the
centrosome, Orf3a to late endosomes, and Orf9b to mitochondria.

Introduction
As most RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 virus utilizes multiple protein-protein interactions
with host factors to subvert cellular functions. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication
involve the sequential use of several organelles of the endocytic and secretory pathways
(Sicari et al., 2020). These include interaction of the viral Spike protein with cell receptors
and its cleavage by the proteases for virion fusion with the cellular membranes (Shang et al.,
2020), subversion of the ER membrane to promote the formation of the replication
organelle (Klein et al., 2020), interaction with the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment for
virion formation (Klein et al., 2020), and final egress of the newly assembled virions through
lysosomes (Ghosh et al., 2020).
The 30 kB genome of SARS-CoV-2 codes for 14 open reading frames. Two of them,
Orf1a and Orf1ab, code for alternative long polypeptides, which give rise to 16 individual
non-structural proteins (Nsp1-16) upon auto-cleavage (Bar-On et al., 2020). Some of these
proteins are directly involved in replication of the viral genome, most prominently the Nsp78-12 replicase complex and the Nsp13 helicase (Subissi et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2020; Hillen
et al., 2020). Others, such as Nsp3, 4 and 6, are transmembrane proteins that promote the
formation of the replication organelle, which is a double-membrane vesicular structure
(Angelini et al., 2013; Oudshoorn et al., 2017; Snijder et al., 2020). Four Orfs code for the
structural proteins of the virions: spike (S), which binds surface receptors on cells (ACE2,
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), nucleoprotein (N), which is responsible for genome
packaging, and two membrane proteins (E and M). A set of very small Orfs code for
polypeptides involved in the final steps of virion formation (e.g. Orf3a and Orf9b).
Affinity-based techniques coupled to mass spectrometry have enabled the
identification of putative host cell targets of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Gordon et al., 2020a;
Stukalov et al., 2020). In one study, 26 proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus have been cloned as
Strep fusions and individually expressed in HEK293 cells, leading to the identification of
about 300 potential host cell protein targets (Gordon et al., 2020a). In another study, the
individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins were HA-tagged and expressed as baits in the type II
pulmonary epithelial cell line A549 (Stukalov et al., 2020). In addition to identifying host
protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, this study also reported changes in the host cell proteome
and in post-translational modifications of the cellular proteins. To circumvent the limitation

of immunoprecipitation experiments, which best capture high affinity soluble protein
complexes, a second approach based on proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) has been
recently presented, further extending the repertoire of the interactants of the individual
SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Laurent et al., 2020; St-Germain et al., 2020). A third approach
employed CRISPR-Cas9 technology to knock out all putative host interactants in order to
determine their effect on viral infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020). The advantage of these
systematic comprehensive studies is in that they enable identification of putative druggable
pathways, pointing to existing approved drugs that could be repurposed to combat the
current worldwide pandemic.
Complementary information can be gained by imaging studies of the cellular
localization and dynamics of viral proteins. Given that individually expressed SARS-CoV-2
proteins interact with a number of organelle-specific proteins, it can be expected that these
viral proteins might localize to and exert their function at the respective organelles. For
instance, Nsp7 and Nsp13, viral proteins involved in genome replication, interact with small
G proteins of the Rab family or with golgins and hence could localize to the Golgi and/or
could influence Golgi morphology or function. In addition, since many SARS-CoV-2 proteins
form protein complexes (e.g. Nsp7/8/12; Nsp10/14) (Ma et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020;
Hillen et al., 2020), combined expression of such proteins might be necessary for in vitro
recapitulation of their behavior. Thus, having a repertoire of expression plasmids with
different tags, including fluorescent ones, should facilitate imaging studies and cellular
investigations in general.
Here, we present a large library of SARS-CoV-2 proteins tagged with either green or
red fluorescent proteins and their initial characterization in several cell lines. These lines
were chosen either to mimic the cell types affected by the virus in COVID-19 patients (e.g.
A549, BEAS-2B and Caco-2) or for their use as established models for the understanding of
basic cellular function (e.g. HeLa, HEK293 and hTert-RPE1). To test for direct proteinmembrane interactions or for interactions with evolutionarily highly-conserved proteins,
some of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were expressed in the unicellular model Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In addition to assessing the localization of individual SARS-Cov-2 proteins or
protein complexes, our microscopy-based approach uncovers morphological and functional
changes that can be induced by SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell.

Results
Construct design
All fluorescent fusion constructs were prepared from the Strep-Tag SARS-CoV-2
plasmid library described in Gordon et al (Gordon et al., 2020a) except Nsp3, which was
from a collection of SARS-CoV-2 constructs in Gateway-compatible entry vectors (Kim et al.,
2020a). For most proteins, we prepared both GFP and mCherry fusion constructs to facilitate
colocalization and dual expression studies (Table 1). In addition to mammalian expression
vectors, we constructed plasmids for expression of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Table S1). All constructs have been deposited to Addgene.
We used existing structural information on the SARS-CoV-2 proteins or their SARSCoV-1 or MERS orthologues to check the relative positions of the N- and C-termini in order
to introduce the fluorescent tag on the most accessible end (Table 1). In the absence of any
information or of an obvious preference, the fluorescent protein was fused at the Cterminus (Table 1). The proteins with an N-terminal tag were Nsp8, a small subunit of the
replicase complex (Nsp7/8/12), Nsp15, a uridine-specific endoribonuclease essential for viral
RNA synthesis, and Orf9b, a very small protein that forms a dimer in the case of SARS-CoV
(Meier et al., 2006). For the helicase Nsp13 (Hao et al., 2017), which has been suggested as a
promising candidate for pharmacological targeting, we prepared both N-ter and C-ter fusion
forms.
To study SARS-Cov-2 proteins in the cellular environment, we expressed single viral

proteins in various cell types, including the model lung epithelial cell line A549, as well as coexpressed proteins that are known to form complexes (e.g. Nsp7, Nsp8 and Nsp12) or to act
together on membranes (e.g. Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6). Overall, the transfection efficiency and
expression levels varied greatly among different constructs and sometimes among different

cell lines. Some viral proteins had tendency to form aggregates and induced cytotoxicity at
high expression levels. Table 2 summarizes these general features.
Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6
Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6 are the three non-structural transmembrane proteins of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. They are involved in the formation of the replication organelle, which has
the shape of a double-membrane vesicle and is derived mostly from the ER. Previous studies

performed with the cognate proteins of the MERS and SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus have shown
that Nsp3 and Nsp4 are necessary and sufficient for double-membrane vesicle formation,
whereas Nsp6 has a facilitating role in this process (Oudshoorn et al., 2017).
In A549 cells, individually expressed Nsp3-GFP showed a characteristic ER network
distribution pattern (colocalization with the ER marker HSP90B1) with some large vacuolar
extensions (Fig 1A). No colocalization was observed with autophagosome or MVB/exosome
markers (Fig S1A). Individually, Nsp4-GFP and Nsp6-GFP were poorly expressed (Fig S1B).
However, co-expression of Nsp3-GFP, Nsp4-mCh and Nsp6-mCh increased the expression
levels for the two latter proteins. The three proteins extensively colocalized and largely

affected the reticular organization of the ER, which displayed extended structures (Fig 1B). In
line with morphological changes of the ER, the staining of the endoplasmic reticulum master
chaperone HSP90B1 diminished with the level of triple Nsp3/4/6 expression (Fig S1C).
Nsp7, Nsp8 and Nsp12
Nsp12 with its accessory subunits Nsp7 and Nsp8 is a central SARS-CoV-2 enzyme
responsible for the replication and transcription of the viral genome through its RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. According to the previously solved structure of
the replicase complex, Nsp12 forms a stoichiometric complex with one Nsp7 and two Nsp8
subunits (Chen et al., 2020; Hillen et al., 2020). Interactome studies in HEK293 cells showed
that individually expressed Nsp7 interacted with numerous host proteins including multiple
members of the Rab GTPase family (Gordon et al., 2020a). We expressed Nsp7, Nsp8 or
Nsp12 fused with GFP or mCherry at their N or C-termini in A549 cells (Fig 2A) as well as in
other cell lines (BEAS-2B, Caco-2, HEK293, HeLa; Fig S2). All fusion proteins appeared
essentially cytosolic although some small puncta were occasionally observed (Fig 2A and S2).
Some Golgi fragmentation could be observed in Nsp12-expressing cells, as demonstrated by

the Golgi marker GM130 (Fig 2A). Dual expression of Nsp7-mCherry and GFP-Nsp8 (Fig 2B)
or of Nsp7-mCherry and Nsp12-GFP (Fig 2B) did not affect the localization patterns of these
proteins as compared to their single expressions.
Nsp10 and Nsp 14
Nsp14 is a bifunctional enzyme composed of an exonuclease domain and a SAMdependent methyltransferase domain (Ma et al., 2015). It forms a complex with Nsp10, a
zinc-finger protein of 139 amino acids that is required for viral replication. Nsp10 has been

proposed to interact with the clathrin-AP2 machinery and the ERGIC network. We expressed
Nsp10-GFP and/or Nsp14-mCherry in A549 cells (Fig 3), in other mammalian cell lines (Fig
S3A), or in yeast (Fig 4). In mammalian cells, individually expressed Nsp10-GFP or Nsp14mCherry appeared mostly cytosolic (Fig 3A and S3A, B). When co-expressed, Nsp10-GFP and
Nsp14-mCherry remained mostly cytosolic with slight colocalization with clathrin (Fig 3B,
arrow) but no obvious colocalization with the Ergic-53 marker (Fig S3C), although large
structures and puncta positive for the two proteins could be observed (Fig 3B and S3C).
In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Nsp10-GFP displayed a punctate pattern (Fig 4A). Some
yeast cells displayed bright and heterogeneous Nsp10-GFP puncta, which may represent
protein aggregates. Other cells with a higher cytosolic signal showed puncta that were
smaller, more uniform and localized close to the cell cortex. This pattern was not influenced
by co-expression of Nsp14-mCherry, which was only cytosolic (Fig 4A). The cortical Nsp10GFP puncta resembled endocytic patches; indeed, they showed partial colocalization with
endocytic proteins Ede1 and Sac6 (Kaksonen et al., 2005), but not with TGN or endosomal
markers (Fig 4B). Moreover, time-lapse imaging revealed that the Nsp10-GFP puncta were
highly mobile and moved partly together with Ede1 (Fig 4B). This phenotype might indicate
an interaction between Nsp10 and an evolutionary-conserved feature of the clathrin
machinery.

Nsp13
The analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome in HEK293 cells revealed that the
helicase Nsp13 interacted with a number of Golgi-associated proteins (golgins) as well as
with centrosomal proteins (Gordon et al., 2020a). We found that Nsp13-GFP was mostly
cytosolic in A549 cells (Fig 5A) as well as in all tested cells including yeast (Fig S4A and B).
However, a fraction of Nsp13-GFP clearly associated with the centrosome as visualized by
anti-gamma tubulin or anti-FGFR1OP antibodies (Fig 5A). In a few cells, we observed faint
colocalization of Nsp13-GFP or Nsp13-mCherry with Golgi markers (Fig 5B, arrow heads). In
addition, the expression of Nsp13 strongly affected the Golgi structure in some cells, with
fragmentation on the cis side (as assessed by the cis marker GM130) and disappearance of
the trans side, as assessed by the trans marker TGN46 (Fig 5B, arrow heads and S4C).
Altogether, these cell localization studies on Nsp13 underscore the relevance of its

interactions with centrosome and Golgi proteins suggested by both affinity- and proximitybased interactome approaches (Laurent et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020a).
Nsp15
Nsp15 is an endonuclease that cleaves single- or double-strand RNAs after uridines
(Subissi et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2020b). In proteomic analysis, Nsp15 has been shown to

interact with Arf6 (Gordon et al., 2020a), a small G protein that resides at the plasma
membrane and on endocytic structures. However, this interaction was not confirmed by
proximity-based approaches. In our experiments, Nsp15 was found cytosolic in A549 cells
(Fig S5A) as well as in yeast (Fig S5B).
Orf3a
Orf3a contains 3 transmembrane helices followed by a long cytosolic tail containing a
Yxxø endocytic motif (Tan et al., 2004). Orf3a self-assembles as a dimer in lipid membranes
where it forms a non-selective cation channel (Kern et al., 2020). In all tested mammalian
cell lines, we observed a vesicular pattern of Orf3a-mCherry (Fig 6A-D and S6A). In A549
cells, Orf3a-mCherry colocalized with late endocytic compartments (Fig 6A, B and Fig S6B).
These compartments were highly mobile, as assessed by time-lapse multicolor imaging (Fig

6B; arrows, bottom panel). Late endosomal localization of Orf3a is in agreement with studies
on Orf3a of the related SARS-CoV-1 virus (Yue et al., 2018). Orf3a-mCherry also partly colocalized with GM130 (Golgi marker) as well as LC3 (autophagosome marker) (Fig 6C), in line
with a recent work showing that Orf3a changes the balance between autophagosome

formation and autophagosome maturation (Qu et al., 2020). Interestingly, Orf3a-mCherry
expression also led to changes in endosomal morphology, with enlargement not only of
Orf3a-containing late endosomes, but also of the early endosomes that did not colocalize
with Orf3a (Fig 6D and S6C). These data suggest possible perturbation of the entire

endocytic pathway by Orf3a.
The preference of Orf3a for late endosomal compartment was preserved even in
yeast, where Orf3a-mCherry could be observed decorating the vacuolar membrane (as
revealed with Vph1-GFP) (Fig 6E). Some Orf3a was also observed at the ER (visualized by
Sec63-GFP; Fig 6E) but not at the Golgi (Sec7-GFP; Fig S6D) and at Golgi-to-vacuole transport
intermediates (Vps17-GFP; Fig S6D). We suspect that some Orf3a was retained in the ER due

to difficulties in folding. In agreement, the localization of Orf3a largely shifted towards the
vacuole in aged yeast cells, and we observed no co-localization with lipid droplets (Fig. S6D).
Orf9b
SARS-CoV-2 Orf9b-GFP fusion protein displayed a typical mitochondrial pattern in all
tested cell lines (A549, BEAS-2B, Caco-2 and HeLa) (Fig 7A and S7A), and was specifically
associated with mitochondria in A549 cells as assessed by its co-localization with the
mitochondrial marker Tom20 (Fig 7A), Mitotracker and DsRed-Mito-7 (Fig S7B), similarly to
what has been described for the cognate protein Orf9b from SARS-CoV-1 (Shi et al., 2014).
Recent investigations indicate that Orf9b from SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the mitochondrial
protein TOM70 (Jiang et al., 2020; Kreimendahl and Rassow, 2020), consistent with our
observations. Mutating an Orf9b residue in the interacting region with TOM70 (Gordon et
al., 2020b) (L52D) abolished the mitochondrial localization of Orf9b (Fig 7A and S7C).
We then co-expressed Orf3a-mCherry and Orf9b-GFP aiming to see whether they

influence each other’s localization. However, the combined expression of the two proteins
did not change their overall localization patterns as compared to single expressions,
although we did observe motile structures co-labeled with the two markers by time-lapse
multicolor imaging (Fig 7B, arrows).
Since the structure of isolated Orf9b strongly differs from the structure of Orf9b in
complex with TOM70 and a direct mechanism for lipid membrane recognition has been
suggested (Meier et al., 2006), we next tested whether Orf9b associated with mitochondria
through protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions. To that end, we expressed Orf9b-GFP
in S. cerevisiae, which harbors a Tom70 protein homologue (Chan et al., 2006; Kreimendahl
and Rassow, 2020). Here, Orf9b-GFP appeared entirely soluble (Fig 7C), suggesting that
mitochondrial localization of Orf9b relies on a specific interaction between Orf9b and human

Tom70.
Envelope protein (E)
Protein E is a very short (75 aa) single-pass transmembrane protein. E proteins of
other coronaviruses function in viral assembly and release. In all tested cell lines, SARS-CoV2 GFP-E showed reticular pattern (Fig S8A) and colocalized with ER markers in A549 cells (Fig
8 and S8B). We also observed deformation of the ER and cytotoxicity in cells expressing high
levels of SARS-CoV-2 E protein.

Discussion
The identification of potential interactions between individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins
and mammalian proteins by affinity- or proximity-based proteomic analysis (Laurent et al.,
2020; St-Germain et al., 2020; Stukalov et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020a) suggests
hypothesis for the cellular pathways that might be targeted to interfere with viral infection
or replication. The fluorescent constructs generated and described in this study should aid at
exploring these interactions in different cellular context, should it be at the scale of
individual proteins or in more integrated studies with several viral proteins working in
concert. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 constructs with a Flag tag and thus suitable for
immunofluorescence are now also available (Zhang et al., 2020). We used our preliminary
microscopy observations with some of the SARS-CoV-2 fluorescent constructs to test the
relevance of some of the reported interactions, notably with regard to the attachment to or
remodeling of membrane compartments.
A striking feature of the interactome map of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins is pairing
of the viral proteins involved in genome replication (e.g. Nsp7 and Nsp13) with organellespecific proteins, such as small G proteins of the Rab family, golgins or centrosomal proteins.
Such interactions raise questions about the position of the replication machinery during cell
infection, and most notably about the topological constraints imposed by the formation of
the replication organelle on the virus replication (Snijder et al., 2020; Wolff et al., 2020).
When the enzymes involved in RNA replication and transcription are encapsulated into a
double-membrane vesicle, they cannot have access to other organelles. However, this
consideration is not valid at the early stages of infection, i.e. before formation of the doublemembrane replication organelle (Snijder et al., 2020). Therefore, a temporal map of the
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and host proteins is needed.
The cell transfection experiments presented here indicate that many Nsp proteins
involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription (e.g. Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp12, Nsp15) appear
intrinsically soluble. A notable exception is Nsp13, which associates with the centrosome.
The observations that Nsp10 colocalizes with endocytic foci in yeast and that co-expressed
Nsp10 and Nsp14 colocalized even partially with clathrin in A549 cells are intriguing because
interaction between Nsp10 and AP-2 subunits have been observed (Gordon et al., 2020a). It
is possible that this interaction is preserved in yeast.

The most striking membrane interactions of the viral proteins analyzed in this study
were that of Nsp3/4/6 and E with ER, Orf3a with late endosomes and Orf9b with
mitochondria, which illustrates complex rewiring of the cellular membranes upon infection
by the virus. Localization of the SARS-CoV-2 E at the ER was somewhat surprising, given that
E proteins of other coronaviruses are mostly localized at the ERGIC and at the Golgi
(Schoeman and Fielding, 2019), except for the avian infection bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein,
which localizes at the ER due to a C-ter retention signal (Lim and Liu, 2001). ER localization of
SARS-Cov-2 E is unlikely to be due to protein-protein interactions since interaction partners
of individually expressed SARS-CoV-2 E protein do not seem to include ER resident proteins
(Gordon et al., 2020a). Other possibilities include the presence of an ER-retention signal
within the protein, as well as retention in the ER due to misfolding or the presence of the
EGFP tag. Interestingly, an online tool for predicting cellular localization of viral proteins
(http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/virus-multi/) identifies the ER as a putative cellular
residence of SARS-CoV-2 E protein, but not of its SARS-CoV homolog, thus favoring the
scenario in which the ER localization is intrinsic to the protein E sequence.
Several viral proteins showed cytotoxic effects and specific effects on the
compartment where they were localized. For instance, we observed deformations of the ER
upon expression of Nsp3/4/6 and CovE and Golgi fragmentation in the presence of Nsp12
and Nsp13. Interestingly, in cells expressing late endosomal Orf3a, we observed
morphological alterations not only in late, but also in early endosomes, suggesting that at
least some viral proteins may have far-reaching effects that extend beyond the expected
changes in the immediate vicinity of the respective proteins.

Material and methods
Mammalian cell expression
A549, HeLa, HEK293, Caco-2, BEAS-2B and hTert-RPE1 cell lines were used for testing
the localization of SARS-Cov-2 proteins. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium or in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum.
Transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofisher) or Lipofectamine 3000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Media was replaced six hours
post-transfection and cells were incubated for a total of 24 or 48h.
Yeast manipulations, strains and plasmid construction
Yeast manipulations were performed using standard methods and growth conditions
(Dunham and Gartenberg, 2015). All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. InFusion HD Cloning Plus kit (Takara Bio) was used according to the supplier instructions.

Briefly, individual PCR products corresponding to coding sequences of the viral proteins
(Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, Orf3a and Orf9b) were cloned into a low-copy (CEN) plasmid
containing the medium-strength ADH1-promotor and a gene for fluorescent protein (C-terGFP, N-ter-mCherry or C-ter-mCherry), upon linearization by a restriction enzyme. All

resulting plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transformed either into
a wild-type yeast strain or, for co-localization analyses, into strains expressing endogenously
tagged yeast proteins. Yeast strains are listed in Table S2. Gene chromosome-tagging was
performed by homologous recombination and confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA. The
tagging with mRuby2 was performed using the plasmid pFa-mRuby::HIS5 (Lee et al., 2013).
Immunofluorescence
Cell fixation was performed with 3% or 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy

Sciences) for 15 min at room temperature or with methanol for 2 min at -20°C. For
permeabilization, cells were incubated in PBS supplemented with 2 g/l BSA and 0.5 g/l
saponin for 10 min at room temperature. For staining with antibodies against EEA1, Lamp1,
M6PR and calnexin, cells were permeabilized with 0.05 % Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at

room temperature.
Primary antibodies used in this study were mouse anti-GM130 (BD Biosciences, ref
610823 and Roche, ref 11814460001), rabbit anti-GalNacT2 (Sigma, HPA01122), sheep anti12

TGN46 (Biorad, ahp500g), mouse anti ERGIC-53 (Santa Cruz, sc-398777), mouse antiHSP90B1 (Sigma, AMAb91019), rabbit anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz, sc-11415), mouse anti-EEA1
(BD Transduction Laboratories, 610456 or 610457), anti-Lamp1 (Santa Cruz, sc-20011), antiM6PR (Abcam, ab134153), anti-calnexin (Millipore, MAB 3126), mouse anti-Tsg101
(GeneTex, GTX70255). Mouse anti-clathrin antibodies were a kind gift from Michel Franco.
Mitochondria were labeled using MitotrackerTM Red CMX Ros (Invitrogen, M7512). For
colocalization studies, particular organelles were visualized by co-expressing fluorescent
organelle markers (Rab7-GFP (Addgene #28047), DsRed2-Mito-7 (Addgene #55838) or
DsRed2-ER-5 (Addgene #55836)). Alexa-Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratory.
Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol and examined with the following microscopes:
1. An inverted LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, France) equipped with a 63X oil
immersion objective lens (numerical aperture NA 1.4). Z-series of 16 to 20 images

were compressed into two dimensions using the maximum projection of Volocity
software (Fig 1, 3, 5, S1, S3B and C, S4C, S5A).
2. A 3D deconvolution microscope (Leica DM-RXA2), equipped with a piezo z-drive
(Physik Instrument) and a 100x1.4NA-PL-APO objective lens for optical sectioning. 3D
or 1D multicolor image stacks were acquired using the Metamorph software (MDS)
through a cooled CCD-camera (Photometrics Coolsnap HQ) (Fig 2A, 2B, 6C, 7A).
3. A Zeiss Axio Observer microscope with a EC Plan NEOFLUAR 100x/1.3 Oil Ph3

objective. Images were acquired by a Zeiss Axiocam 506 mono camera using a ZEN
blue software (Fig S2, S3A, S4A, 6A and D, S6A-C, S7, 8, S8).
Live cell imaging of the mammalian cells
Spinning-disk confocal time-lapse imaging was done at 37°C in a thermostatcontrolled chamber using an Eclipse 80i microscope (Nikon) equipped with spinning disk
confocal head (Perkin), a 100x objective and either a Ultra897 iXon camera (Andor) or
CoolSnapHQ2 camera (Roper Scientific). Corresponding time-lapse images are displayed in
Figure 2B, 6B and 7B.

Yeast cells were grown for 14–24 h at 30°C in an appropriate minimal medium to
maintain plasmid selection. Cells were harvested by centrifugation in mid-logarithmic phase
(OD600=0.5-0.8) or, exceptionally, in stationary phase (OD600=4-6) and prepared for viewing
on glass slides. Imaging was performed at room temperature using an Axio Observer Z1
microscope (Zeiss), equipped with an oil immersion plan apochromat 100× objective NA 1.4,
an sCMOS PRIME 95 camera (Photometrics) and a spinning-disk confocal system CSU-X1
(Yokogawa). GFP-tagged proteins and mCherry- or mRuby-tagged proteins were visualized
with a GFP Filter 535AF45 and an RFP Filter 590DF35, respectively. Images were acquired
with MetaMorph 7 software (Molecular Devices) and processed with ImageJ (NIH, MD).
