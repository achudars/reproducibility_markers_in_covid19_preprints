Abstract

20

The development of a vaccine against COVID-19 is a hot topic for many research laboratories

21

all over the world. Our aim was to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine offering a wide

22

range of multi-epitope determinants important for the immune system including not only the

23

spike (S) protein but also the envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins.

24

We designed a semi-split vaccine prototype consisting of S protein-depleted viral particles

25

and free S protein. Next, we investigated its immunogenic potential in BALB/c mice. The

26

animals were immunized intradermally or intramuscularly with the dose adjusted with buffer

27

or addition of aluminum hydroxide, respectively. The antibody response was evaluated by

28

plasma analysis at 7 days after the first or second dose. The immune cell response was studied

29

by flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes. The data showed a very early onset of both S

30

protein-specific antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies at 90% inhibition regardless of

31

the route of vaccine administration. However, significantly higher levels of neutralizing

32

antibodies were detected in the intradermally (geometric mean titer - GMT of 7.8 ± 1.4) than

33

in the intramuscularly immunized mice (GMT of 6.2 ± 1.5). In accordance with this,

34

stimulation of cellular immunity by the semi-split vaccine was suggested by elevated levels of

35

B and T lymphocyte subpopulations in the murine spleens. These responses were more

36

predominant in the intradermally immunized mice compared with the intramuscular route of

37

administration. The upward trend in the levels of plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1 and Th2

38

lymphocytes, including follicular helper T cells, was confirmed even in mice receiving the

39

vaccine intradermally at a dose of 0.5 µg.

40

We demonstrated that the semi-split vaccine is capable of eliciting both humoral and cellular

41

immunity early after vaccination. Our prototype thus represents a promising step toward the

42

development of an efficient anti-COVID-19 vaccine for human use.

Introduction

46

The COVID19 pandemic has made the development of a vaccine an emergency priority.

47

Hectic research was enabled by recent major advances in sequencing, protein structure

48

identification, and epitope mapping that have suggested the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2

49

virus as a top candidate for vaccine construction to elicit effective antibodies [Hoffmann

50

2020, Robbiani 2020] which was why vaccine researchers all over the world focused

51

exclusively on this particular immunogen. The first vaccines in clinical trials are designed not

52

only as traditional ones (i.e., inactivated or live) but also as RNA vaccines not used in human

53

clinical research to date. In fact, except for wholly inactivated vaccines that include other

54

important antigens, all vaccines currently being tested contain only the S protein [Xia 2020,

55

Zhang 2020, Pu 2020].

56

S protein-based vaccines are designed as subunit ones [Keech 2020]. Alternatively, the

57

protein is expressed in host cells from non-replicating (defective) viral vectors currently using

58

simian or human adenovirus type 5 or 26 [Zhu 2020, Logunov 2020, Folegatti 2020, Sadoff

59

2020] or from mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles [Jackson 2020, Sahin 2020,

60

Mulligan 2020, Walsh 2020]. These vaccines clearly exhibited a great immunogenic potential

61

diminished by an increased frequency of adverse events in the early trials. Conversely,

62

inactivated virion vaccines have consistently showed reasonable immunogenicity with a very

63

good safety profile.

64

Recent computational approaches have suggested that the envelope (E), membrane (M) and

65

nucleocapsid (N) proteins should be included in multi-epitope vaccines as these proteins

66

exhibit conserved sequence features with a high affinity for the major histocompatibility

67

complex (MHC) [Ghafouri 2020, Khairkhah 2020, Noorimotlagh 2020, Sarkar 2020].

68

Unlike the worldwide commercial efforts to develop efficient and safe vaccines, we sought to

69

construct an emergency vaccine under a project referred to as the “Emergent Coronavirus

70

Vaccine” (EmCoVax). The principal aim of the first phase was to develop and test the process

71

of vaccine production. We decided to design a semi-split inactivated vaccine containing

72

separately S protein and S protein-free viral particles. Early immunogenicity was

73

subsequently investigated in a mouse model within two weeks of immunization to test the

74

very rationale of this type of vaccine.

Materials and Methods

78
79

Viruses and tissue cultures cells

80

SARS-CoV-2 (strain 951) was selected from the virus archive of the National Institute of

81

Public Health of the Czech Republic. Virus stock was produced in Vero E6 cells obtained

82

from the American Type Culture Collection (VERO 76, ATCC® CRL-1587™) under serum-

83

free conditions using OptiPro medium (Life Technologies Europe BV, Bleiswijk, the

84

Netherlands).

85
86

Electron microscopic examination

87

Approximately 500 μL of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 suspension was placed on a parafilm with

88

attached two formvar/carbon-coated TEM grids pretreated by 1% Alcian blue to increase

89

hydrophilicity and allowed to stand for 20 minutes. The first grid was stained with 2%

90

aqueous solution of ammonium molybdate and the second one with 2% aqueous solution of

91

uranyl acetate. After removing the residual fluid using filter paper, the grids were observed

92

under a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi HT-7800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

94

Virus titer determination

95

The infectious virus titer of SARS-CoV was determined by the tissue culture infectious dose

96

50% (TCID50) assay. In brief, serial 10-fold dilutions of virus-containing samples were

97

inoculated onto confluent Vero E6 monolayers in 96-well plates. After incubation for 5 days

98

at 37°C in a CO2 incubator, the cells were assessed for the presence of a cytopathic effect

99

(CPE) by means of an inverted optical microscope. TCID50 was determined by a 50%

100

reduction in CPE using the Reed-Muench formula [Ramakrishnan 2016].

101
102

Determination of S protein content

103

The concentration of the S protein was determined with an ELISA kit (SARS-CoV-2 Spike

104

ELISA kit, Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China). A monoclonal antibody specific for the S

105

protein of SARS-CoV-2 was pre-coated onto well plates. Standards and samples were added

106

to the wells and the S protein present in the sample was bound by the immobilized antibody.

107

After incubation, the wells were washed and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-S

108

antibody added, producing a sandwich complex. After washing to remove the unbound

109

antibody, a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution was loaded. The reaction was

110

stopped by the addition of a stop solution and the color intensity was measured at 450 nm. To

111

determine the S protein concentration in the sample, a standard curve was generated at

112

concentrations of the working standard, within a range of 2,500-10,000 pg/mL of the S

113

protein.

114
115

Virus neutralization assay (VNT90)

116

Mouse plasma were tested for functional antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 with the standard

117

virus neutralization test. Prior to the test, each plasma sample was heated at 56°C for 30

118

minutes. Serial 2-fold dilutions of the plasma from 1:2 to 1:32 were subsequently incubated

119

with 100 TCID50 of the vaccine of the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain for 2 hours and added to

120

VERO E6 cell monolayers. The characteristic CPE was read on Day 5. Neutralizing antibody

121

titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the last plasma dilution that completely inhibited

122

CPE in 90% of the wells using the Reed-Muench formula [Tseng 2012, Zakhartchouk 2005,

123

Spruth 2006].

124
125

ELISA antibodies assay

126

Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in mice were detected with a commercial ELISA

127

kit (Human Anti-2019 nCoV(S) IgG ELISA Kit, FineTest, Wuhan, China) where the purified

128

horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG detection antibodies were replaced

129

by HRP-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd. China)

130

diluted with an antibody dilution buffer at 1:1,000 according to the anti-mouse IgG

131

manufacturer’s instructions. ELISA plates were pre-coated with a recombinant 2019-nCoV

132

spike protein. The assay provided semiquantitative results by calculating the ratio of the

133

optical densities (ODs) of the plasma samples over the negative control OD. Since negative

134

mouse plasma was unavailable, dilutions of plasma samples and their ODs were log-

135

transformed, and the intercept of the regression straight line on the dilution axis represented

136

the log-titer of antibodies. To avoid overestimation of the titer, its value was assessed as an

137

antilogarithm of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of this intercept.

138
139

Flow cytometry analysis

140

Samples preparation was carried out according to standard protocols (see Supplement).

141

Briefly, spleens from mice were harvested, pooled in each group and dissociated using the

142

gentleMACS Octo dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish Gladbach, Germany) according to

143

the manufacturer’s protocol for preparation of single-cell suspensions from the murine spleen

144

without enzymatic treatment. The resultant single-cell suspension was further purified using

145

the standard Ficoll density gradient [Cossarizza 2019]. Purified cells were subsequently

146

resuspended in CryroStor medium (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO) and stored in liquid

147

nitrogen until analysis. A 24-color spectral cytometry panel was designed to characterize T

148

and B cell differentiation and activation status. Cells were stained using standard protocols

149

and acquired using the Aurora spectral cytometer (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, CA). Data

150

analysis was carried out using manual gating or unsupervised clustering analysis (see

151

Supplement).

152
153

Animal experiment

154

All animals were maintained in a conventional animal facility in a 12/12 light/dark regimen,

155

controlled temperature and free access to pelleted food and water. All protocols were

156

approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental

157

Medicine and the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.

158

A total of 52 BALB/c mice (Velaz, Czech Republic) were immunized with vaccine (40 mice)

159

or placebo (12 mice) at age 9-10 weeks. The vaccinated mice were divided into 8 groups of 5

160

mice immunized with one or two intramuscular or intradermal doses containing 0.5 or 1.5 μg

161

of the S protein. A total of 12 mice, i.e., 4 groups of 3 mice with one or two intradermal or

162

intramuscular doses, received placebo (0.9% NaCl solution). The volume of each dose,

163

whether of vaccine or placebo, was consistently 10 μL. All mice received the first dose on

164

Day 0, with half of them immunized with the second dose on Day 7.

165

Disposable insulin syringes with integrated needle (BD Micro-fine plus; 0.3 ml, Becton,

166

Dickinson, NJ) were used for both routes of administration. While the intramuscular dose was

167

applied into the right caudal thigh muscle, the intradermal one was applied into the auricle

168

under the guidance of a microscope.

169

One week after the first or second dose, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and blood

170

was intracardially withdrawn using a 2 ml syringe, transferred to anticoagulant tubes

171

(K2EDTA), and mixed. Whole blood was centrifuged (3300 rpm, 10 minutes, 4°C), plasma

172

aliquoted into 100 µl microtubes and frozen at -80° C. The spleens were collected in chilled

173

RPMI medium on ice and transported to laboratory within 4 hours for flow cytometry

174

examination.

175
176

Statistical analysis

177

Anti-S specific IgG antibodies as well as virus-neutralizing antibodies were expressed as the

178

titer. The value had to be log-transformed to pass a normality test (D'Agostino & Pearson or

179

Shapiro-Wilk test) followed by a parametric t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA).

180

As the lymphocyte populations were measured from pooled spleens of each group, the

181

traditional statistical approach could not be employed; hence, the change in lymphocyte

182

subsets using linear regression was determined. If the slope of lines exhibited values

183

significantly different from null, then the observed change was considered to be confirmed.

184

Merged lymphocyte subpopulations were analyzed with parametric tests after log-

185

transformation to pass a normality test (Shapiro-Wilk test). The power of each test was

186

insufficient since the sample size was small. A >80% power of the test was only achieved

187

when comparing the geometric mean titers of antibodies between immunized and

188

unimmunized mice.

189

The correlation between IgG antibodies and virus-neutralizing antibodies was assessed with

190

the Pearson correlation coefficient after the log-transformation of their values.

191

Continuous data were summarized using standard descriptive statistics, i.e., median including

192

range or geometric mean with standard deviation or 95% confidence interval. All tests were

193

two-tailed, and the level of significance was set at 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed

194

using Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) and STATA version 16 software

195

(StatCorp, College Station, TX).

Results

198
199

Course of the culture, inactivation and purification process

200

To obtain a viral stock for vaccine production, the virus strain 951 was first purified by 4

201

passages in VERO E6 cells. Subsequently, another 8 passages were performed to generate a

202

sufficient stock of virus for the production of the master seed as the source of a virus bank for

203

vaccine production through the seed lot system. Growth kinetics analysis of the second

204

passage showed a sufficient virus replication rate reaching a titer of 6.0-6.5 log10 TCID50/mL

205

in the supernatant within 2-8 days (Figure 1). The peak titers of 6.5 and 7.5 log10 TCID50/mL

206

from the supernatant and lysate, respectively, were at 56 hours post-infection. Moreover,

207

multiplicities of infection (MOI) of 0.001-0.0001 at a culture temperature of 37°C and 5%

208

CO2 were confirmed.

209

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells, grown in OptiPro serum-free medium (Life

210

Technologies Europe BV, the Netherlands) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), were infected

211

by the strain from the second passage of the stock and incubated in a serum-free medium at

212

37°C and 5% CO2 for 56 hours. The first viral suspension of 225 mL was obtained by

213

centrifugation of the supernatant harvest at 300 g for 5 minutes. The second suspension was

214

harvested from infected cells by adding an approx. 90 mL of medium, overnight freezing and

215

thawing at -20°C followed by centrifugation under the same conditions. Both live viral

216

suspensions containing viral particles with typical corona spikes as documented by electron-

217

microscopic inspection (Figure 2A) were stored at 4°C for at least 11 days.

218

The suspensions were subsequently inactivated by adding beta-propiolactone diluted 1:2,000,

219

and continuously shaken up at a temperature of 4°C for 48 hours. The beta-propiolactone

220

hydrolysis at 37°C lasted 2 hours. Inactivated suspensions were centrifuged and the

221

supernatants were stored at 4°C for one week. The second inactivation was performed with

222

beta-propiolactone diluted 1:1,000 at 4°C for 66 hours. After that, the pellets were centrifuged

223

at 1,800 g for 10 minutes and both inactivated suspensions were subsequently placed in water

224

baths to hydrolyze beta-propiolactone with continuous stirring at 37°C for 2 hours with the

225

temperature gradually decreasing to 27°C overnight.

226

The inactivated viral suspension contained of 0.5 μg/mL of the S protein for the supernatant

227

harvest and 4.9 μg/mL for the lysate harvest. While the first inactivation did not influence the

228

virion structure, the second one showed partial changes, i.e., complete and incomplete

229

particles with disrupted S protein (Figure 2B and 2C).

230

The inactivation including hydrolysis decreased the pH to 6.0-6.5 that disrupted S protein

231

binding to the viral envelope as documented by a record from the electron microscope (Figure

232

2C). Both suspensions were stored at 4°C for 3 days to be followed by vaccine purification

233

and thickening to obtain 3 μg/10 μL the for harvested supernatant and 1 μg/10 μL for the

234

harvested lysate. This was achieved by a multiple ultra/diafiltration process utilizing Amicon®

235

Ultra centrifugal filter units (Amicon Ultracel) with a volume of 15 mL and a membrane

236

molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 100 kDa (Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit –

237

100 kDa cutoff, Merck Millipore Ltd., Darmstadt, Germany). The suspensions were

238

centrifuged several times in Amicon Ultracel at 1,000 g for at least 5 minutes to exchange the

239

culture medium and to remove cellular debris and low-molecular substances. The suspension

240

was washed several times with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) of pH 7.4.

241

Inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed by assaying absent CPE in Vero E6 cells

242

within a dilution range of 10-1 to 10-4.

243

The result of purification and thickening were suspensions containing both virion particles

244

free of the spike and separated S protein as documented by electron microscopy (Figure 2D).

245

The vaccine dose for the test of immunogenicity in mice was adjusted in PBS to

246

concentrations of 0.5 μg/10 μL for the harvested lysate and 1.5 μg/10 μL for the harvested

247

supernatant. Since two different routes of administration, i.e., intradermal (ID) or

248

intramuscular (IM) one, were anticipated, the IM doses were prepared by dilution in a 0.05%

249

solution of aluminum hydroxide wet gel (Alhydrogel adjuvant 2%, InvivoGen) so the final

250

concentrations were identical for either route of administration.

251
252

Safety of immunization

253

No pathological manifestations were observed in any mouse during post-immunization

254

follow-up as were not any reductions in feed or water intake. Behavioral manifestations and

255

weight gain were physiological. No efflorescence or other pathological reactions were found

256

at the site of inoculation.

257

All body surfaces and orifices of all animals were free of any pathology. Mild splenomegaly

258

was observed in the spleen of two animals immunized intradermally suggesting a cellular

259

immune response to vaccination. Other internal organs were free of signs of inflammation or

260

other pathologies. Likewise, no pathological activation of the immune system described

261

during infection with the wild virus was seen in our project.

Immunogenicity in mice

264

A single dose administered intradermally or intramuscularly showed significantly increased

265

anti-S IgG antibodies compared with mice receiving placebo. Although the rise in anti-S IgG

266

antibody levels was small, it was proportional to a short post-vaccination time (Figure 3).

267

Unfortunately, it was not possible to evaluate the statistical significance among different

268

groups categorized by dose size and route of administration since the sample size was too

269

small to achieve enough statistical power. Regarding both routes of administration, one can

270

expect a somewhat earlier response in mice immunized with a lower antigen content no

271

matter whether one or two doses were administered.

272

Although the levels of anti-S IgG antibodies increased at 7 days after two-dose immunization,

273

no statistical significance was found compared with the levels observed 7 days after the first

274

dose (Figure 3). The same outcome was confirmed in both groups assessed according to the

275

route of administration regardless of the antigen amount.

276

Functional antibodies determined as virus-neutralizing antibodies with 90% protective

277

activity showed a significant increase at 7 days after the first or second dose independently of

278

the route of administration (Figure 4). Although the second dose repeatedly increased the

279

geometric mean of titers (GMT) of VNT90 antibodies independently of dose size or route of

280

administration, the rate of growth was higher in mice immunized intradermally or

281

intramuscularly with a dose of 1.5 μg. Despite this, the rise was not quite significant (p=0.08).

282

Irrespective of the size dose, the GMT of neutralizing antibodies induced by the first

283

intradermal dose was 6.8±1.3 and was significantly higher than that in the mice immunized

284

intramuscularly, i.e., 5.1±1.4. While the second ID dose contributed to a non-significant

285

increase in virus-neutralizing antibodies (GMT = 8.8±1.3), the second IM dose significantly

286

increased geometric mean of neutralizing antibodies to 7.7±1.4 (p<0.05).

287

Moreover, a good correlation between anti-S IgG and VNT90 titers of antibodies was

288

documented, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86 (Figure 5).

Post-vaccination responses established by the change of selected lymphocytes populations in

290

the murine spleens, i.e., plasmablasts, short- and long-lived plasma cells, including memory B

291

cells, as well as Th1, Th2, Th17 and follicular Th lymphocytes, were observed in immunized

292

mice compared with unimmunized ones regardless of the route of administration and number

293

of doses received (Figure 6). While a significant increase was observed in follicular Th

294

lymphocytes for both routes of administration compared with unimmunized mice, a

295

borderline increase in memory B cells was seen only in mice with ID vaccination. No post-

296

vaccination changes in the subsets of regulatory T cells or cytotoxic T lymphocytes as well as

297

active B cells were found (data not shown).

298

The follicular Th lymphocytes demonstrated an upward trend depending on the time or

299

number of received doses in immunized mice regardless of the dose size or route of

300

administration (Figure 7B). The slope of the regression line differing significantly from null

301

(p<0.05) revealed that mice immunized intradermally with a 0.5 μg dose exhibited

302

significantly increasing proportions not only of follicular Th lymphocytes but also Th1 and

303

Th2 lymphocytes with an increasing number of doses (Figure 7A). In addition, the same

304

effect was observed in these mice for subsets of plasmablasts and memory B cells.

305
306

Discussion

307

The above laboratory procedure generated a semi-split inactivated vaccine, i.e., a vaccine with

308

the S protein separated from the viral particle exhibiting an early, both humoral and cellular,

309

immune response.

310

The design of this prototype vaccine was based on the usual procedures [Tang 2003, Spruth

311

2005, Gao 2020]. We selected a strain showing higher infectivity with lower virulence, i.e.,

312

one that showed signs of attenuation. Overall, we have tested several candidate strains for

313

both immunogenicity through convalescent plasma and propagation capacity by viral titration.

314

Viral growth kinetics analysis was in line with the published data [Gao 2020, Manenti 2020].

315

Furthermore, we devised a technique to increase the virus concentration in suspension about

316

100 to 1,000- fold (note: this finding requires validation).

317

To inactivate the virus properly, beta-propiolactone was chosen because it can alkylate the

318

viral genome and keeps the virus capable of inducing a protective immune response [Delrue

319

2012]. The process of viral suspension double inactivation was designed in accordance with

320

the procedures of other vaccine manufacturers [Pu 2020, Xia 2020].

321

Use of the purification technique proposed by us resulted in an anticipated separation of S

322

proteins from viral particles. We assumed that our semi-split vaccine could better offer all of

323

the four important antigens to the immune system, i.e. spike, envelop, membrane and

324

nucleocapsid proteins. The semi-split inactivated vaccine induced a humoral immune

325

response as demonstrated by both anti-S IgG and virus-neutralizing antibodies.

326

Unfortunately, our immunogenicity results cannot be compared with the currently available

327

data since we focused on monitoring the very early response, i.e., 7 days after one or two

328

administered doses.

329

The success of this semi-split vaccine was a rapid onset of the immune response. It was

330

slightly higher after intradermal than intramuscular administration independently of the

331

number of doses and post-vaccination period. The second dose contributed to an increase in

332

both anti-S IgG and virus-neutralizing antibody levels, but only neutralizing antibodies

333

induced by two IM doses exhibited a significant rise compared with one IM dose regardless

334

of size dose.

335

The post-vaccination cellular immunity suggested increased proportions of B and T

336

lymphocytes subsets in the spleen such as plasmablasts, long- and short-lived plasma cells,

337

memory B cells, Th1 and Th2 including Th17 lymphocytes whatever the route of

338

administration, number and size of doses compared with the lymphocyte counts of placebo-

339

treated mice. Obviously, a significant elevation was achieved in follicular Th lymphocytes for

340

both intradermal and intramuscular vaccine administration.

341

Surprisingly, a marked upward trend in plasmablasts, memory B cells, Th1, Th2 and follicular

342

Th lymphocytes was demonstrated in mice immunized intradermally with one and two 0.5 μg

343

doses. It is not clear at the moment whether or not this effect is influenced by dose size or

344

exclusively by the intradermal route of administration.

345

As we have evaluated only the early immune response to date, it cannot be concluded that a

346

higher dose or intramuscular administration would be inferior in the final response. Still, early

347

immunogenicity was better as demonstrated in mice with intradermal immunization.

348

We are well aware of the need to further investigate the other specific antibodies, i.e., not only

349

against the S protein but, also, against the E, M and N proteins as potential candidates not

350

tested in the current phase of development yet. The body of knowledge obtained from an

351

immuneinformatics approach suggests that the design of a multi-epitope vaccine including all

352

four antigens could hold promise to achieve efficient and safe vaccination against SARS-

353

CoV-2 [Abdelmageed 2020].

354
355

Conclusion

356

As it is, the semi-split inactivated vaccine seems to be capable of inducing both humoral and

357

cellular immunity, especially after its intradermal administration. The early immune response,

358

reasonable safety profile observed in the animal model as well as potential multi-antigenic

359

extended post-vaccination protection are likely to be acceptable for human immunization.
