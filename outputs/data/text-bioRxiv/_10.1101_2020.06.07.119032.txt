Abstract: COVID-19 has become a major challenge to global health, and until now, no efficient
antiviral agents have been developed. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by pulmonary and
systemic inflammation in severe patients, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused
respiratory failure contributes to most mortalities. There is an urgent need for developing effective
drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 caused ARDS. However, most researchers
cannot perform SARS-CoV-2 related researches due to lacking P3 or P4 facility. We developed a
non-infectious, highly safety, time-saving SARS-CoV-2 components induced murine model to study
the SARS-CoV-2 caused ARDS and cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). We also investigated mAbs and
inhibitors which potentially neutralize the pro-inflammatory phenotype of COVID-19, and found that
anti-IL-1α, anti-IL-6, anti-TNFα, anti-GM-CSF mAbs, p38 inhibitor, and JAK inhibitor partially
relieved CSS. Besides, anti-IL-6, anti-TNFα, anti-GM-CSF mAbs and inhibitors of p38, ERK, and
MPO somewhat reduced neutrophilic alveolitis in the lung. In all, we established the murine model
mimic of COVID-19, opening a biosafety and less time-consuming avenue for clarifying the
mechanism of ARDS and CSS in COVID-19 and developing the therapeutic drugs.

Introduction
In early December 2019, pneumonia of an unknown cause appeared in Wuhan. The virus strain was
first isolated from patient samples on January 7, 2020, and the whole genome sequence of the virus was
then obtained on January 10, 20191-3. The genome of the virus was compared with SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV, and the homology was about 79% and 50% respectively. Therefore, it was named as novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)4. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection5. A total of 7,410,510
confirmed cases of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 have been reported globally as of June 14th,
2020. The total number of deaths worldwide reached 418,294. Until now, no specific antiviral drugs or
vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been developed. The epidemic of COVID-19 is threatening public
health. Methods to control the virus and improve the treatments have quickly become urgent issues
concerning national security across the world.
As the COVID-19 progressing, patients may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
cytokine storm syndrome (CSS)6. CSS, which showed a disorder of the immune system and a rapid
increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels after the stimulus, has been reported to associate with the
deterioration of various severe diseases7. In COVID-19 patients, the CSS occurred when the plasma
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-17, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IP10, MCP1,
MIP1α and TNFα were significantly increased, recruiting immune cells through a positive feedback
loop, eventually forming a cytokine storm8-10. Therefore, clarifying the mechanism of CSS in
COVID-19 patients and discovering the key cytokines contribute to developing more effective methods
to block CSS, which is of great significance for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The continued
global epidemic of COVID-19 emphasizes the necessity of establishing a COVID-19 related
pneumonia animal model. Currently, most animal models have used virus strains isolated from

COVID-19 patients, which can simulate human pathophysiological processes, but it lacks biosecurity
and can only be performed in the biosecurity P3/P4 labs11,12. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
establish an effective animal model for the research of COVID-19 pneumonia that is non-infectious and
can be performed in less well-equipped laboratories.
Here, our laboratory has successfully developed a highly biosecurity and time-saving ARDS animal
model, which simulates the CSS and the pathophysiological changes happened in the COVID-19
patients by using Poly I:C and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Poly I:C and SP). The combination of Poly
I:C and SP were used as SARS-CoV-2 mimic. We identified some neutralizing mAbs and inhibitors
have some prophylactic efficacy for COVID-19. More importantly, it could have useful implications
for the intervention of current and afterward coronavirus infectious diseases.

Results
First, we inoculated SARS-CoV-2 mimic into mice lung through intratracheal injection (Figure 1a).
After the administration of Poly I:C and SP, acute lung injury featuring neutrophilic inflammation and
interstitial edema were observed. The lung tissue showed severe injury with Poly I:C and SP, which
was more severe than Poly I:C induced only. To better understand the time course of pathologic
changes, we explored the time point of lung injury. The lung injury occurred at 6 h, was most severe at
24 h, but gradually decreased at 48 h (Figure 1b). Besides, the mice suffered from extensive pleural
fluid accumulation between 24 h and 48 h post-challenge. Pleural effusion was measured by using
small animal MRI. Gross lung lesions were observed at 24 h after challenge, reduced at 48 h, and not
apparent at 6 h (Figure 1c).

To understand the molecular pathology of Poly I:C and SP induced lung injury, cytokines and flow
cytometric analysis were performed to determine the inflammatory molecules and related immune cells.

The level of IL-1α, IL-6 and TNFα were dramatically increased in Poly I:C plus SP group as compared
with Poly I:C or SP alone group. Saline and recombinant FC protein cannot stimulate the production of
cytokines, Poly I:C or SP shows a higher level of IL-1α, IL-6, and TNFα (Figure 2a). Intratracheal
injection of saline, SP and recombinant FC protein cannot stimulate an increase of dsDNA, an indicator
of NETs (Figure 2b). Total cellularity of mice bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples showed a
significant increase in an SP dose-dependent manner after 24 h challenge (Figure 2c). Furthermore,
investigation of cellularity in the mice BAL samples by flow cytometry. The result showed that
neutrophils, but not macrophages, significantly infiltrated and migrated into the lungs. It should be
noted that the number of neutrophils in the BAL at SP dose-dependent increased compared with saline
(Figure 2d). For the time point study, the SARS-CoV-2 mimic led to an increase in the inflammatory
cytokines IL-1α, IL-6 and TNFα at 6 h. However, TNFα and IL-6 significantly decreased at 24 h
timepoint as compare with 6 h timepoint. When compared with saline, all cytokines levels were
increased at 24 h timepoint (Figure 2e). We noted that there was no significant difference in the
infiltration of neutrophils between those two time points (Figure 2f). Moreover, a unique mechanism of
the neutrophil effector is the generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs); the level of NETs can
be quantified by measuring cell-free double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). In our study, the concentration of
dsDNA was used as an indicator of NETs. At the 6 h and 24 h time point after challenge, there was no
significant difference in the concentration of dsDNA in the mice BAL samples (Figure 2g).
Furthermore, we dissociated cells from the mice lung tissue after 24 h installation of Poly I:C and SP,
and maintained for 6 h and 24 h. The concentrations of IL-6 were still increasing after dissociation, and
longer maintaining produced more IL-6 into the medium. This indicated that CSS happens in the lungs

after installation of SARS-CoV-2, along with immune cells such as tissue-resident macrophages highly
inflammatory and activated (Figure 2h).

We hypothesized that one or more cytokines drove the CSS. To validate the hypothesis, we applied
the neutralizing antibody such as anti-IL-1α, anti-IL-6 or anti-TNFα and blocking antibody anti-IL6R
or anti-TNFR2 in this animal model. Neutralizing IL-6 reduced the production of cytokine IL-6 in BAL,
with no effect on IL-1 α and TNFα (Figure 3a). However, IL-6R blocking mAbs was unable to alter the
concentrations of IL-1α, IL-6 and TNFα in BAL (Figure 3b). Anti-TNFα mAbs reduced the production
of cytokine TNFα in BAL, with no effect on IL-1α and IL-6 (Figure 3c). However, TNFR2 mAbs
failed to alter the production of IL-1α, IL-6 and TNFα (Figure 3d). Neutralizing mAbs targeting IL-1α
directly reduced the cytokines IL-1α, and IL-6 also reduced significantly, but not TNFα (Figure 3e). In
addition, concentrations of GM-CSF not increased in BAL during SARS-CoV-2 challenge, but
anti-GM-CSF mAbs could reduce the production of TNFα (Figure 3f).

Infiltration of neutrophils caused the neutrophilic alveolitis during SARS-CoV-2 challenge. The
percent of neutrophils in BAL were tested after anti-IL-6 (Figure 3g), anti-IL6R (Figure 3h), anti-TNFα
(Figure 3i), anti-TNFR2 (Figure 3j), anti-IL-1α (Figure 3k) and anti-GM-CSF (Figure 3l) treatment.
The result indicated that neutralizing of cytokines IL-6, TNFα and GM-CSF or blocking the IL-6R
could reduce the infiltration of neutrophils. Concentrations of dsDNA were no reduction after
antibodies treatment (Figure 3m). Next, we treated RAW264.7 cells with Poly I:C and evaluated the
production of IL-6 in the medium. The results indicated a reduced trend of IL-6 while treating with 20

μg antibodies although not significantly (Figure 3n). Our histological analysis results indicated that
treatment with neutralizing or blocking mAbs of inflammatory cytokines could partially reduce the

neutrophilic inflammation and interstitial edema in the lung, but not anti-TNFR2 (Figure 3o). Therefore,
potent therapeutic efficacy in a synergistic manner can be considered in clinical.

NETs can also be generated by macrophages13, and strongly contribute to acute lung injury during
virus infection14-16. We hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 mimic stimulates the macrophages and
produce inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1α, IL-6 and TNF-α, recruit and activate neutrophils. P38
and ERK are the signaling mediators of NETs formation. MPO and Elastase as the peroxidase enzyme
in neutrophils and essential for NETs formation 17,18. TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor can block the
interactions between TLR3 and Poly I:C. JAK inhibitor can block the downstream signaling of IL-6. In
our study, we found that the inhibition of P38 reduces IL-1α and inhibition of JAK reduces IL-6
significantly (Figure 4a). We noticed a decrease in the infiltration of neutrophils after treatment of P38,
ERK and MPO inhibitors, which all targeted activities of neutrophils (Figure 4b). There was no
significant difference in the concentrations of dsDNA after the treatment of those inhibitors (Figure 4c).
Furthermore, we performed the cell assay to validate the effect of TLR3/dsRNA inhibitor and JAK
inhibitors on mouse primary macrophages. TLR3/dsRNA inhibitor did not reduce the IL-6 production
at 45 μM. JAK1/2 inhibitor Baricitinib reduced the production of IL-6 significantly, but not Febratinib
(JAK2 inhibitor) (Figure 4d). Histological analysis result indicated that inhibitors of P38, ERK, MPO
and Baricitinib (JAK inhibitor) obviously decreased the neutrophilic inflammation and interstitial
edema in the lung (Figure 4e).

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 has posed a serious threat to global public health. Antiviral drugs, such as
hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and remdesivir did not achieve an ideal therapeutic effect19,20. In order
to understand the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 induced ARDS/CSS and find an effective

strategy to prevent and remedy this highly infectious disease, we have developed a murine ARDS
model, to mimic pathological changes in COVID-19 patient. Coronavirus includes a large genomic
RNA and can stimulate TLR3/7 upon infection21-25. We used Poly I:C to mimic the effect of viral RNA.
Moreover, the unique outcome of recombinant SP was showed in a TNFα outbreak featured CSS when
compared with Poly I:C challenged mice. The TNFα storm revealed that the underlying mechanism of
CSS happened in COVID-19 patients, not just IL-6 or IL-1α, TNFα may play a more critical role. As a
new target in our model, anti-TNFα may need a tight treatment window, the TNFα burst was observed
after 6 h administration of SARS-Cov-2 mimic and disappeared at 24 h. Furthermore, IL-6 maintained
its high level during the administration of SARS-CoV-2 mimics, anti-IL-6, or related signaling may
provide a relatively broad treatment window.

Impaired inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients provide a distinct pattern of
COVID-19 progression in host immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, with exhausted
lymphocytes, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, CSS in severe cases of COVID-199,26-29. CSS was
found to be the major cause of morbidity in patients with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV30, with the
presence of IL-6 in the plasma being a hallmark of severe infections. Clinical trials using IL-6 and
IL-6R antagonists are underway31. In our research, we first tested the effect of IL-6 or IL-6R mAbs,
IL-6 in BAL was affected, but IL-1α and TNFα no changes. Importantly, treatment of IL-6 or IL-6R
mAbs reduced neutrophil infiltration. This result may indicate that blocking IL-6 signaling shows
partially benefit from the SARS-CoV-2 mimics induced neutrophilic alveolitis, and CSS in lung did not
appear to effective mitigation. Furthermore, blocking of JAK-STAT3 signaling also could inhibit the
IL-6 mediated signaling transduction. For blocking TNFα signaling, we performed the TNFα and
TNFR2 mAbs. TNF exerts its effect by stimulation of two different receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2.

TNFR1 is expressed in all cell types, but TNFR2 is only expressed in certain cell types, such as myeloid
cells, glial cells and T and B cell subsets. Neutralizing TNFα via mAbs reduced the production of TNFα
in our model, IL-6 and IL-1α not affected. Treatment of TNFα mAbs, but not TNFR2 mabs reduced
neutrophil infiltration. Those results indicated that TNFα signaling shows partially reduced neutrophilic
alveolitis and benefit from SARS-Cov-2 mimic induced CSS. GM-CSF is a cytokine found in high
levels in patients with COVID-19, anti-GM-CSF mAbs was used for the treatment of COVID-19
clinical trial (NCT04400929)2. In our present data, anti-GM-CSF reduced neutrophil infiltration and
decreased the TNFα during SARS-Cov-2 mimic challenge. Even we did not find GM-CSF enriched in
BAL, but anti-GM-CSF treatment shows protection effect from neutrophilic alveolitis and NETs
induced lung injury.

It was reported that macrophages in the lungs may contribute to inflammation by producing multiple
cytokines/chemokines and recruiting more inflammatory monocytic cells and neutrophils 32,33. We have
applied various signal pathway inhibitors to block the dysregulated macrophages and neutrophils.
TLR3/dsRNA Complex inhibitor blocked the dsRNA and TLR3 interaction, but in our present data,
TNFα in BAL cannot induced by single Poly I: C. and SARS-Cov-2 includes a single strand RNA
genome, TLR7 also sense the viral RNA34.

To prevent sustained activation of neutrophils, we applied P38 inhibitor SB203580, ERK inhibitor
Tauroursodeoxycholate and MPO inhibitor 4-Aminobenzoic hydrazide in the SARS-CoV-2 mimic
model. It was reported that MPO is a functional and activation marker of neutrophils. Elastase was
produced by neutrophils and can mediate lung injury. Inhibitors of MPO and elastase can directly
reduce the acute lung injury at the inflammatory site18,35,36. In our study, inhibitors include P38
inhibitor, ERK inhibitor, MPO inhibitor and elastase inhibitor can reduce the neutrophil infiltration into

lung, but not elastase. Here we used the neutralizing or blocking antibodies, essential pathway
inhibitors of the innate and adaptive immune responses to target the most abundant cytokines, NETs
and other pro-inflammatory factors to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 caused CSS and ARDS. Our data
indicate that potential combination of those neutralizing/blocking antibodies or inhibitors may
contribute to the treatment of CSS and ARDS, and should be investigated further.

Taken together, we established a non-infectious, high safety and time-saving murine robustness model
by using Poly I:C and SP, which mimic the pathological changes of SARS-CoV-2 caused CSS and
ARDS. This model can be available for research on COVID-19 caused CSS and ARDS, addressing the
immunopathology alterations, and exploring new therapies of COVID-19.

by centrifuge at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The ELISA assay was performed to detect the IL-6 concentration
following the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, United States).
Specific statistical methods and comparisons made by methods as described in figure legend.
Comparison between two groups were performed by paired Student's t-test or unpaired Student's t-test.
P < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant and marked with a star, data was reported as
mean±SEM, and error bars indicate SEM.
