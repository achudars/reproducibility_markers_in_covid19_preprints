Catalytic cleavage of HEAT and subsequent covalent binding of the
tetralone moiety by the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.
Abstract: Here we present the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main
protease (Mpro) covalently bound to 2-methyl-1-tetralone. This complex was
obtained
by
co-crystallization
of
Mpro
with
HEAT
(2-(((4hydroxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one) in the
framework of a large X-ray crystallographic screening project of Mpro against a
drug repurposing library, consisting of 5632 approved drugs or compounds in
clinical phase trials. Further investigations showed that HEAT is cleaved by
Mpro in an E1cB-like reaction mechanism into 2-methylene-1-tetralone and
tyramine. The catalytic Cys145 subsequently binds covalently in a Michael
addition to the methylene carbon atom of 2-methylene-1-tetralone. According
to this postulated model HEAT is acting in a pro-drug-like fashion. It is
metabolized by Mpro, followed by covalent binding of one metabolite to the
active site. The structure of the covalent adduct elucidated in this study opens
up a new path for developing non-peptidic inhibitors.
Introduction
The pandemic disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is an
international health challenge and there is an immediate need for the
identification of drugs for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Infection of
host cells critically depends on several molecular factors from both the host
and virus (1, 2). Coronaviruses are RNA-viruses with a genome of around 30
kbp. The viral gene essential for the replication of the virus is expressed as
polyprotein that must be broken into functional subunits for replication and
transcription activity (1). This proteolytic cleavage is primarily accomplished
by the main protease (Mpro), also known as the 3C-like protease 3CLpro. Mpro
cleaves the viral polyprotein at eleven sites. The core cleavage motif is LeuGln(Ser/Ala/Gly) (1). Mpro possesses a chymotrypsin-like fold amended by a
C-terminal helical domain and harbors a catalytic dyad comprising Cys145
and His41 (1). The active site is located in a cleft between the two N-terminal
domains of the three domain structure of the monomer, while the C-terminal
helical domain is involved in regulation of dimerization of the enzyme with a
dimerization constant of 2.5 µM (1). Due to its central involvement in virus
replication Mpro is well established as a prime target for antiviral compounds
that can tackle coronavirus infections (3). Indeed first studies confirm the
potential of targeting Mpro for inhibition of virus replication (1, 2).
In order to identify further potential drug candidates with an inhibitory effect on
Mpro we screened the “Fraunhofer IME Repurposing Collection” (4), consisting
of 5632 individual compounds against Mpro by means of high-throughput X-ray
crystallography. This compound collection is based on the BROAD institute
repurposing library (5). In contrast to crystallographic screening campaigns
with small molecules (“fragment screening”) (6), our library contains
compounds that are chemically more complex and of larger molecular mass.
As Mpro crystals possess a low solvent content of only 38% (1) with narrow

solvent channels that could impede larger molecules from diffusing into the
active site in soaking experiments, we co-crystallized Mpro with the individual
compounds instead of soaking pre-grown Mpro crystals in compoundcontaining solutions. Crystals typically appeared within 2 days and were then
submitted to single crystal X-ray structure determination (see Methods). From
the resulting X-ray structures, several compounds were identified in complex
with Mpro. Among these was BE-2254 (HEAT, 2-(((4-hydroxyphenethyl)amino)methyl)-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one), where a well
resolved electron-density was observed in the active site of the Mpro crystal
structure. This electron-density can be well modeled as 2-methyl-1-tetralone
(METT) covalently bound to the sulfur atom of Cys145, thereby blocking
access to the active site of Mpro and occupying the P1 site of the protease. 2Methyl-1-tetralone is potentially a breakdown product of the parent compound
HEAT included in the co-crystallization experiment.
HEAT was first synthesized by Hansen at Beiersdorf AG (7). It exists in an
equilibrium between two enantiomers between which it transitions via ketoenol tautomerism (8). Investigations by several groups found it to be a
competitive α-adrenoreceptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo with lower affinity
to the α-subtype and residual affinity to dopaminergic and serotonergic
receptors (9).
Here we present the crystal structure of Mpro with 2-methyl-1-tetralone (METT)
covalently bound to the active site to 1.8 Å resolution. To further support this
observation and to understand the underlying mechanism of HEAT
fragmentation by Mpro and its subsequent covalent binding to the active site,
we conducted complementary native and small molecule mass spectrometry
and computational docking studies. On the basis of these results we propose
a reaction mechanism and provide an outlook for the application of HEAT as a
starting point for potential drug development to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Results
The overall structure of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) with bound
METT as obtained in our X-ray diffraction experiment is shown in figure 1
(table 1). It possesses the same overall structural features as previously
described (1, 2). A closer view of the active site reveals clear unoccupied
electron-density for a small molecule covalently bound to the catalytic Cys145
which could be well modeled as METT (figure 1B). The chemical structures of
the parent compound HEAT and the observed cleavage product METT bound
to MPro are illustrated in figure 1C and D, respectively, clearly showing the
relationship between the two molecules. This observation suggests METT to
be a breakdown product of HEAT, with tyramine (TY) as the complementary
product (figure 1E).

the atoms). Diffraction data together with coordinates were deposited in the

To confirm the cleavage of HEAT by Mpro and subsequent covalent binding of
METT to Mpro, native mass spectrometry (MS) experiments were performed
(10). In a control experiment without the addition of HEAT we observe a high
intensity peak envelope corresponding to the expected mass of the Mpro dimer
(67,599 +/- 5 Da, charge states +14 to +16). The monomer is also visible with
lower intensity (33,795 +/- 2 Da, charge states +9 to +11) (figure 2A). Next
Mpro was incubated with HEAT at a molar ratio of 1:10 (Mpro:HEAT) overnight.
After incubation of Mpro with HEAT two additional peak envelopes can be
observed in the high mass range (figure 2B). Their assigned masses
correspond to the Mpro dimer alone or plus one and two METT molecules
(67,593/67,774/67,955 Da). The corresponding stoichiometry of Mpro dimer
without or either one or two bound METT was approximately 4:5:1.

Additionally peaks from monomeric Mpro bound to one METT molecule and
unmodified Mpro are also observed. The expected ion of intact HEAT with 296
Da (MH+) is observed in the low mass range (suppl. fig. 1). The reaction
product METT is not observed as it is too small to be detected with the
instrument settings used for these measurements.
To probe the chemical interaction between Mpro and HEAT, CID-MS/MS was
performed by separating a molecular ion precursor (+15, dimer) in the
quadrupole of the mass spectrometer and triggering its dissociation in a
collision cell (see Methods). The dimer dissociated into low- and high-charge
monomeric molecular ions. METT was observed to still be bound to the highcharge ions (suppl. figure 1). The ratio of the dissociated monomer in the
unbound to bound state was roughly 5:4. The binding of the reactive group to
the dissociated molecule indicates a strong interaction between Mpro and
METT, as would be expected for a covalent bond. Furthermore, only one
METT per monomer is detected which suggests that the interaction is sitespecific.

([METT]2[DTT]Na+).
In addition, the small-molecule products from the reaction of HEAT with Mpro
were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC)-MS in the range of 100 to 1000
Da (figure 2, see Methods). Pure HEAT elutes at 4.5 min and displays major
ions at 296 Da (MH+) and 318 Da (MNa+). After overnight incubation (12
hours) at room temperature of an excess of HEAT with Mpro, two new LC-MS
peaks were observed at 6.4 and 8.5 min. Masses of 335.3 and 493.3 Da
appear in the corresponding MS-ES+ spectrum, which could not be attributed
to either of the expected reaction products METT (183 Da) or TY (137 Da).
These observed masses correspond to the two possible adducts of METT and
DTT (154 Da), which was used as reducing agent in the protein buffer. The
observed signals correspond to MNa+ ions of METT bound to one or both thiol
groups of DTT ([METT][DTT]Na+ or [METT] [DTT]Na+, respectively). The
reaction product TY was observed in the MS-ES- spectrum (137 Da, supp.
figure 2) in the presence of Mpro. To confirm the assignment of the METT and
DTT adducts we substituted DTT with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP)
as reducing agent. In the absence of DTT no additional LC-MS signals
besides HEAT were observed, and no masses corresponding to the METTDTT adducts could be detected. This supports the presence of the proposed
METT intermediate (figure 1F) in the HEAT cleavage mechanism, which can
be intercepted by the strong nucleophilic thiol group of DTT. In contrast,
TCEP is much less nucleophilic and hence does not react with the
intermediate of the HEAT cleavage.

Understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism requires knowledge
about the initial binding of HEAT to Mpro which was not observed in the X-ray
diffraction experiment. To obtain information on the initial binding state of
HEAT to Mpro, computational docking studies were employed using JAMDA
and HYDE (11) (figure 3). We visually inspected multiple proposed noncovalent binding modes which might help to reveal the possible reaction
mechanism. The keto form of HEAT (figure 3A) is found to occupy pockets P1
and P2 with a carbon-sulfur distance of 3.4 Å. HEAT forms a hydrogen bond
to His163 in the active site via the carbonyl oxygen atom, a weak hydrogen
bond to Cys145 via its secondary amine, and a T-stacking interaction to
His41. The enol form (figure 3B) seems to be more stably bound to the active
site, forming not only the two aforementioned hydrogen bonds, but also a
hydrogen bond to Cys44 via its phenol moiety. Additionally, a pi-pi stacking
interaction between His41 and the phenol moiety can be observed in this
predicted binding mode. Moreover, the carbon-sulfur distance of 3.5 Å for the
enol form of HEAT to Cys145 is well within the acceptable range for covalent
bond formation. This non-covalent binding mode corresponds well to the
experimentally determined binding mode of METT which occupies the S1
pocket (figure 3C). Additionally, the leaving group of the molecule is situated
in the S2 pocket and is engaged in a weak pi-pi stacking interaction with
His41 and a weak hydrogen bond to Cys44. We hypothesize that HEAT
initially binds non-covalently to the protease and is converted to the
corresponding enol form prior to the formation of the α,β-unsaturated ketone.
This process might be catalyzed by residues His163 and Cys145, which are
engaged in hydrogen bonds to the product METT as well as the proposed

non-covalently bound keto- and enol-form of HEAT. Due to the covalent
binding to the active-site Cys145, we expected an inhibitory effect on the
enzyme function and thus virus replication.

Discussion
Combining all experimental and computational results allows us to propose a
plausible, albeit highly unusual, reaction mechanism. Mpro is a cysteine
protease possessing the conserved reactive center dyad Cys145 and His41,
which together catalyze the sequence-specific hydrolysis of peptide bonds,
vital for SARS-CoV-2 replication. We propose a similar mechanism for the
cleavage of the drug HEAT, leading to a suicide reaction of the protease,
which terminates in a covalent thioether bond between Cys145 and METT
(figure 4). As initiation the tetralone carbonyl is activated by His163, forming
an enol. The thiolate of Cys145 could serve as base, removing the hydrogen
of the β-carbon and forming the enol. After enol-oxygen deprotonation by
His163, an unimolecular conjugate base elimination (E1cB)-like mechanism
expels the protonated tyramine amine, forming 2-methylen-1-tetralone in the

active site. In a subsequent step this highly reactive intermediate reacts in a
Michael addition, where the thiolate of Cys145 attacks the ,-unsaturated 2methylen-1-tetralone, forming a thioether bond resulting in covalently bound
METT. This final reaction state was confirmed by X-ray crystallography to a
resolution of 1.8 Å. As evident in our LC-MS analysis some METT can react
with DTT and it is not yet clear whether this occurs within the active site or
spontaneously in solution.

Figure 4: Proposed reaction mechanism of HEAT with Mpro. HEAT exists in
equilibrium between a keto- (A) and enol- (B) form via tautomerism. The
catalytic center bound enol form of HEAT eliminates the tyramine group,
leaving 2-methylene-1-tetralone in the active site (C). This is attacked by the
thiol of Cys145, forming the observed covalent thioether bond (D). This enol is
again in equilibrium with the keto-form, observed in the X-ray structure (E).
The current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 and also the earlier epidemics caused
by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed the risk posed by coronaviruses and
stressed the need for pan-coronavirus antiviral drugs to be better prepared for
future outbreaks. Mpro is highly conserved across coronaviruses (12) (suppl.
figure 3). The active site residues His41 and Cys145 are strictly conserved.
Furthermore, in our structure METT binding is stabilized by a hydrogen bond
to His163 as well as by van der Waals interactions with the backbone of the
oxyanion hole formed by residues Leu141 and Asn142 and neighboring
Phe140. These residues are all essential for the protease activity of Mpro and
thus are conserved as well. Further experiments to investigate the influence of
HEAT on the activity of other coronaviruses need to be conducted to confirm
the potential of developing HEAT as a pan-coronavirus inhibitor.
Currently most structurally well described SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors are
rationally designed peptidomimetic or peptide-based inhibitors (1, 2, 13, 14).

However, some structures of non-peptidic inhibitors were recently reported.
For example Baicalein is a natural product derived from traditional Chinese
medicine (15). It is non-covalently bound in the active site of Mpro. In contrast
the antineoplastic drug carmofur is converted by Mpro and its lipophilic
hexamethylcarbamate moiety remains covalently bound to Cys145 (16), likely
through a mechanism reminiscent of hydrolyzing a peptide substrate.
Chemically the mechanism of reaction of carmofur with Mpro is different from
the one we observe for HEAT.
In conclusion we have discovered that the alpha adrenergic antagonist HEAT
is metabolized by and covalently bound to the active site of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro. Further evaluation of the antiviral activity of HEAT is required, as in a
first high throughput screen of the same repurposing library it did not show
any significant antiviral activity (4). In spite of this, the complex between
METT and Mpro can be considered a starting point for future drug design
efforts. Chemical modifications of the molecule might help to endow it with
pharmacologically relevant inhibitory activity and to develop HEAT towards a
viable drug option.
The obtained results also strongly highlight that drug discovery investigations
to treat SARS-CoV-2 should not only focus on traditional and conservative
approaches aiming to identify substrate-analogue inhibitors, but should also
include the identification and discovery of pro-drug compounds that could act
as suicide drugs (17, 18). This approach is based on the simple but effective
idea of a classical pro-drug, which needs to be metabolized first before
becoming toxic for the infecting agent, in this case the virus SARS-Cov-2 via
deactivation of Mpro.
In this context and according to our postulated model, HEAT can be
considered as a pro-drug as well as suicide drug which binds first to the active
site of Mpro, where it is cleaved in an E1cB-like reaction mechanism into 2methylene-1-tetralone and tyramine. The Cys145 sulfur subsequently binds
covalently in a Michael addition to the methylene carbon atom of 2-methylene1-tetralone thereby blocking the active site and inactivating Mpro.
Methods
Mpro crystallization. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified for
subsequent crystallization according to previously published protocols (1). Cocrystallization with the compounds was achieved by equilibrating a 6.25 mg/ml
protein solution in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM DTT, 1 mM
EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl against a reservoir solution of 100 mM MIB, pH 7.5,
containing 25% w/w PEG 1500 and 5% v/v DMSO. Prior to crystallization
compound solutions in DMSO were dried onto the wells of SwissCI 96-well
plates. To obtain well-diffracting crystals in a reproducible way seeding was
applied for crystal growth. Crystals appeared within a few hours and reached
their final size after 2 - 3 days. Crystals were manually harvested and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent X-ray diffraction data collection.
X-ray data collection and processing. X-ray data were collected at beamline
P11 at the synchrotron radiation facility PETRA III at DESY in Hamburg(19).

Data were collected at an X-ray energy of 12 keV. Using the P11 sample
changing robot data collection time was 3 minutes for a full 200 degree
rotation dataset, including sample exchange. Data analysis was carried out
using XDS (20), COOT (21), PHENIX (22), and PanDDA (23), in addition to
some bespoke software tools. Chemical restraints for the bound compound
were generated from SMILES using phenix.elbow (24) and compared with
results from acedrg (25) and grade (26). The fully refined model and structure
factors were deposited in the PDB with accession code 6YNQ. The
distribution of protein residues over the Ramachandran plot was
97.04/2.63/0.33% (favored/allowed/outliers).
Mass-spectrometric analysis of compound binding. Mpro samples were
prepared for native MS measurements by buffer-exchange into ESI
compatible solutions. Mpro was buffer exchanged into 300 mM NH4OAc, pH
7.5 by five cycles of centrifugal gel filtration (Vivaspin columns, 30.000
MWCO, Sartorius). Mpro (250 µM, 300 mM NH4OAc, pH 7.5) was incubated
with HEAT (2.5 mM in DMSO) for 20 h and diluted 1:20.
Nano ESI capillaries were pulled in-house from borosilicate capillaries (1.2
mm outer diameter, 0.68 mm inner diameter, filament, World Precision
Instruments) with a micropipette puller (P-1000, Sutter instruments) using a
squared box ﬁlament (2.5 × 2.5 mm2, Sutter Instruments) in a two-step
program. Subsequently capillaries were gold-coated using a sputter coater
(Q150R, Quorum Technologies) with 40 mA, 200 s, tooling factor 2.3 and end
bleed vacuum of 8×10−2 mbar argon. Native MS was performed using an
electrospray quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) instrument (Q-TOF2,
Micromass/Waters, MS Vision) modified for higher masses (27). Samples
were ionized in positive ion mode with voltages applied at the capillary of
1300 V and at the cone of 130 V. The pressure in the source region was kept
at 10 mbar throughout all native MS experiments. For desolvation and
dissociation, the pressure in the collision cell was adjusted to 1.8×10 -2 mbar
argon. Native-like spectra were obtained at an accelerating voltage of 30-100
V, while for collision-induced dissociation these voltages were increased to
150-170 V. In ESI-MS overview spectra, the quadrupole profile was 1-10,000
m/z. In tandem MS, for precursor selection, LMres and HMres were adjusted
at 50 V collisional voltage until a single peak was recorded, and then
dissociation was induced. To calibrate raw data, CsI (25 mg/ml) spectra were
acquired and calibration was carried out with MassLynx (Waters) software.
Data were analysed using MassLynx (Waters).
Small-molecule mass spectrometry. Analytical LC-MS data were obtained
using a Waters Alliance 2795-HT LC-MS system equipped with a
Phenomenex Kinetex column (2.6 μm, C18, 100 Å, 4.6 x 100 mm2) and a
Phenomenex Security Guard precolumn (Luna, C5, 300 Å) at a flow rate of 1
mL/min at 30 ˚C. Detection was carried out by a diode array detector (Waters
2998) in the range 210 to 600 nm together with a Waters Quatro-Micro mass
detector, operating simultaneously in ES+ and ES− modes between 100 and
1000 m/z. Solvents were: A, HPLC grade H2O containing 0.05% formic acid;
B, HPLC grade CH3CN containing 0.045% formic acid. The gradient was as
follows: 0 min, 10% B; 10 min, 90% B; 12 min, 90% B; 13 min, 10% B; 15 min,
10% B. Samples (20 µl) were made up in a mixture of buffer and CH 3CN

between 10 and 1000 µg/mL. Enzyme assays were terminated by addition of
an equivalent volume of CH3CN. Protein was removed by centrifugation and
reaction components were directly injected.
