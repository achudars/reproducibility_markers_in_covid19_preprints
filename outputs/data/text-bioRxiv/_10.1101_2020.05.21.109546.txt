Abstract

2

Virus neutralization remains the gold standard for determining antibody efficacy.

3

Therefore, a high-throughput assay to measure SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is urgently

4

needed for COVID-19 serodiagnosis, convalescent plasma therapy, and vaccine development.

5

Here we report on a fluorescence-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay that detects SARS-

6

CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 patient specimens and yields comparable results to

7

plaque reduction neutralizing assay, the gold standard of serological testing. Our approach

8

offers a rapid platform that can be scaled to screen people for antibody protection from COVID-

9

19, a key parameter necessary to safely reopen local communities.

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by severe acute

13

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first reported in Wuhan, China in late

14

20191,2. As of May 18, 2020, COVID-19 has caused 4.8 million confirmed infections and over

15

318,028 deaths worldwide (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Many areas of the

16

world have been in lockdown mode to curb the viral transmission, but the reality is that COVID-

17

19 is here to stay until a safe and efficacious vaccine becomes available. The pandemic’s

18

catastrophic economic impact is pushing governments to reopen their economies, and this

19

creates a public health quandary. At this time, our only option is to minimize viral transmission

20

through social distancing and contact tracing, which relies on the diagnosis of viral RNA through

21

RT-PCR (https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download). Proper public health policy would be

22

greatly enhanced if we had a reliable and facile assay to measure the immune protection among

23

COVID-19 recovered patients.

26

onset, respectively4. Given the unknown scale of asymptomatic infections, there is a pressing

27

need for serological diagnosis to determine the real number of infections. Such information is

28

essential for defining the case-fatality rate and for making the policy on the scale and duration of

29

social lockdowns. The serological assays are also required to identify donors with high-titers for

30

convalescent plasma for therapy, and to define correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2.

31

While viral RNA-based testing for active infection is the current standard, surveying antibody

32

protection is a necessary part of any return to social normality.

33

For serodiagnosis, several COVID-19 assay platforms have achieved FDA emergency

34

use authorizations (EUA), including ELISA5 (https://www.fda.gov/media/137029/download),

35

lateral flow immunoassay (https://www.fda.gov/media/136625/download), and Microsphere

36

Immunoassay (https://www.fda.gov/media/137541/download). These assays measure antibody

37

binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Since not all spike-binding antibodies can block viral

38

infection, these assay platforms do not functionally measure antibody inhibition of SARS-CoV-2

39

infection. An ideal serological assay should measure neutralizing antibody levels, which should

40

predict protection from reinfection. Conventionally, neutralizing antibodies are measured by

41

plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Although PRNT and ELISA results generally

42

corelate with each other, the lack of complete fidelity of ELISA continues to make PRNT the

43

gold-standard for determining immune protection6,7. However, due to its low throughput, PRNT

44

is not practical for large scale serodiagnosis and vaccine evaluation. This is a major gap for

45

COVID-19 surveillance and vaccine development.

46

To address the above gap, we developed a fluorescence-based assay that rapidly and

47

reliably measures neutralization of a reporter SARS-CoV-2 by antibodies from patient

48

specimens. The assay was built on a stable mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 where the

49

mNeonGreen gene was engineered at the OFR7 of the viral genome8. Fig. 1a depicts the

50

flowchart of the reporter neutralization assay in a 96-well format. Briefly, patient sera were

51

serially diluted and incubated with the reporter virus. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, Vero E6

52

cells (pre-seeded in a 96-well plate) were infected with the virus/serum mixtures at a multiplicity

53

of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 16 h post-infection, the mNeonGreen-positive cells were quantitated

54

using a high-content imaging reader (Fig. 1a). Forty COVID-19 serum specimens from RT-PCR-

55

confirmed patients and ten non-COVID-19 serum samples (archived before COVID-19

56

emergence) were analyzed using the reporter virus. After reporter viral infection, the cells turned

57

green in the absence of serum (Fig. 1b, bottom panel); in contrast, incubation of the reporter

58

virus with COVID-19 patient serum decreased the number of fluorescent cells (top panel). A

59

dose response curve was obtained between the number of fluorescent cells and the fold of

60

serum dilution (Fig. 1c), which allowed for determination of the dilution fold that neutralized 50%

61

of fluorescent cells (NT50). The reporter assay rapidly diagnosed fifty specimens in less than 20

62

h: all forty COVID-19 sera (specimens 1-40) showed positive NT50 of 80 to 5152, and all ten

63

non-COVID-19 sera (specimens 41-50) showed negative NT50 of <20 for (Fig. 1d).

64

To validate the reporter virus neutralization results, we performed the conventional

65

PRNT on the same set of patient specimens. In agreement with the reporter virus results, the

66

forty positive sera showed PRNT50 of 40 to 3200, and the ten negative sera exhibited PRNT50 of

67

<20 (Fig. 1d). A strong correlation was observed between the reporter virus and PRNT results,

68

with a correlation efficiency R2 of 0.9 (Fig. 1e). The results demonstrate that when diagnosing

69

patient specimens, the reporter virus assay delivers neutralization results comparable to the

70

PRNT assay, the gold standard of serological testing.

71

Next, we evaluated the specificity of reporter neutralization assay using potentially cross-

72

reactive sera and interfering substances (Table 1). Two groups of specimens were tested for

73

cross reactivity. Group I included 138 clinical sera from patients with antigens or antibodies

74

against different viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Group II consisted of 19 samples with albumin,

75

elevated bilirubin, cholesterol, rheumatoid factor, and autoimmune nuclear antibodies. None of

76

the specimens cross neutralized mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1), including the four

77

common cold coronaviruses (NL63, 229E, OC43, and HUK1). The latter result is consistent with

78

the recent reports that sera from common cold coronavirus patients did not cross react with

79

SARS-CoV-25,9. However, more specimens are required to further validate the cross reactivity,

80

particularly between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and

81

MERS-CoV.

82

In this study, we developed a rapid fluorescence-based high-throughput assay for

83

COVID-19 serodiagnosis. The reporter virus assay is superior to antigen/antibody binding

84

assays because it measures functional SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in the specimens.

85

When diagnosing patient sera, the reporter virus assay generated NT50 values comparable to

86

the conventional PRNT assay. Compared with the PRNT assay, our reporter neutralization test

87

has shortened the assay turnaround time by several days and increased the testing capacity to

88

high throughput. Previously, lentiviruses or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with

89

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been reported for neutralization assays10. One weakness of the

90

spike pseudotyped assay is that it lacks the same composition of an actual virion, including the

91

SARS-CoV-2 M or E proteins. In addition, the spike protein conformation, either the trimer or

92

monomer, may be different in the pseudotypted virus as compared with the authentic SARS-

93

CoV-2 virion.

94

Since mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 is stable and replicates like wild-type virus, our

95

reporter neutralization assay provides an ideal model for high-throughput serological testing. As

96

the mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 grows to >107 PFU/ml in cell culture8, the reporter virus can be

97

easily scaled up for testing large sample volumes. Besides mNeonGreen, we have begun to

98

develop other reporter SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., luciferase or mCherry) that can also be used for such

99

serological testing. Although the current study performed the assay in a 96-well format, the

100

assay can be readily adapted to 384- and 1536-well formats. Despite the strengths of high

101

throughput and reliability, the current reporter neutralization assay must be performed in

102

biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment. Efforts are ongoing to engineer an attenuated version of

103

SARS-CoV-2 so that the assay could be performed at a BSL2 facility. Nevertheless, the

104

mNeonGreen reporter assay offers a rapid, high-throughput platform to test COVID-19 patient

105

sera not previously available.

106

Because neutralizing titer is a key parameter to predict immunity, the reporter

107

neutralization assay should be useful for high-throughput evaluation of COVID-19 vaccines and

108

for identification of high neutralizing convalescent plasma for therapy. Indeed, treatment of

109

severe COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma shows clinical benefits11. For vaccine

110

development, a standardized neutralizing assay will facilitate down selection of various

111

candidates for clinical development. Furthermore, the reporter assay could be used over time to

112

monitor the waning of protective neutralizing titers in COVID-19 patients and to study the

113

correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the ability to rapidly measure neutralizing

114

antibody levels in populations is essential for guiding policymakers to reopen the economy and

115

society, deploy healthcare workers, and prepare for SARS-CoV-2 reemergence.

Methods

171

mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2. The virus stock of mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 was

172

produced using an infectious cDNA clone of SARS-CoV-2 in which the ORF7 of the viral

173

genome was replaced with reporter mNeonGreen gene8. After rescued from the genome-length

174

viral RNA-electroporated cells, the viral stock was prepared by amplifying the mNeonGreen

175

SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells for one or two rounds. The titer of the virus stock was determined

176

by a standard plaque assay.

177

Human sera and interfering substances. All suman serum specimens were obtained

178

at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). All specimens were de-identified from

179

patient information. A total of forty de-identified convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients

180

(confirmed with viral RT-PCR positive) were tested in this study. Ten non-COVID-19 sera,

181

collected before COVID-19 emergence12,13, were also tested in the reporter virus and PRNT

182

assays. For testing cross reactivity, a total of 138 de-identified specimens from patients with

183

antigens or antibodies against different viruses, bacteria, and parasites were tested in the

184

mNeonGreen SARS-COV-2 neutralization assay (Table 1). For testing interfering substances,

185

nineteen de-identified serum specimens with albumin, elevated bilirubin, cholesterol, rheumatoid

186

factor, and autoimmune nuclear antibodies were tested in the reporter neutralization assay. All

187

human sera were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min before testing.

188

mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 reporter neutralization assay. Vero E6 cells (1.2×104) in

189

50 µl of DMEM (Gibco) containing 2% FBS (Hyclone) and 100 U/ml Penicillium-Streptomycin

190

(P/S; Gibco) were seeded in each well of black µCLEAR flat-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-

191

one™). The cells were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2. On the following day, each

192

serum was 2-fold serially diluted in 2% FBS and 100 U/ml P/S DMEM, and incubated with

193

mNeonGreen SARS-CoV-2 at 37°C for 1 h. The virus-serum mixture was transferred to the

194

Vero E6 cell plate with the final multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. For each serum, the starting

195

dilution was 1/20 with nine 2-fold dilutions to the final dilution of 1/5120. After incubating the

196

infected cells at 37°C for 16 h, 25 μl of Hoechst 33342 Solution (400-fold diluted in Hank’s

197

Balanced Salt Solution; Gibco) were added to each well to stain cell nucleus. The plate was

198

sealed with Breath-Easy sealing membrane (Diversified Biotech), incubated at 37°C for 20 min,

199

and quantified for mNeonGreen fluorescence on CytationTM 7 (BioTek). The raw images (2×2

200

montage) were acquired using 4× objective, processed, and stitched using the default setting.

201

The total cells (indicated by nucleus staining) and mNeonGreen-positive cells were quantified

202

for each well. Infection rates were determined by dividing the mNeonGreen-positive cell number

203

to total cell number. Relative infection rates were obtained by normalizing the infection rates of

204

serum-treated groups to those of non-serum-treated controls. The curves of the relative

205

infection rates versus the serum dilutions (log10 values) were plotted using Prism 8 (GraphPad).

206

A nonlinear regression method was used to determine the dilution fold that neutralized 50% of

207

mNeonGreen fluorescence (NT50). Each serum was tested in duplicates. All mNeonGreen

208

SARS-CoV-2 reporter neutralization assay was performed at the BSL-3 facility at UTMB.

seeded to 6-well plates. On the following day, 100 PFU of infectious clone-derived wild-type

211

SARS-CoV-2 was incubated with serially diluted serum (total volume of 200 µl) at 37°C for 1 h.

212

The virus-serum mixture was added to the pre-seeded Vero E6 cells. After 1 h 37°C incubation,

213

2 ml of 2% high gel temperature agar (SeaKem) in DMEM containing 5% FBS and 1% P/S was

214

added to the infected cells. After 2 days of incubation, 2 ml neutral red (1 g/l in PBS; Sigma)

215

was added to the agar-covered cells. After another 5-h incubation, neutral red was removed.

216

Plaques were counted for NT50 calculation. Each serum was tested in duplicates. The PRNT

217

assay was performed at the BSL-3 facility at UTMB.

218

Statistical analysis. The correlation of the NT50 values from mNeonGreen reporter

219

SARS-CoV-2 assay and the PRNT50 values from plaque neutralization assay was analyzed

220

using a linear regression model in the software Prism 8 (GraphPad).
