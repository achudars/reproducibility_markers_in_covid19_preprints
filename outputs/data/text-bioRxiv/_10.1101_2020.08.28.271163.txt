Abstract
The spike (S) protein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2

26

(SARS-CoV-2) binds to a host cell receptor which facilitates viral entry. A polybasic motif

27

detected at the cleavage site of the S protein has been shown to broaden the cell tropism

28

and transmissibility of the virus. Here we examine the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants

29

with mutations at the S protein cleavage site that undergo inefficient proteolytic cleavage.

30

Virus variants with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques and exhibited a more

31

limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type strain. These alterations were

32

shown to result from their inability to utilize the entry pathway involving direct fusion

33

mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2. Notably, viruses

34

with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants in

35

TMPRSS2-deficient cells including Vero cells. Our study demonstrated that the S protein

36

polybasic cleavage motif is a critical factor underlying SARS-CoV-2 entry and cell tropism.

37

As such, researchers should be alert to the possibility of de novo S gene mutations

38

emerging in tissue-culture propagated virus strains.

Introduction

40

The World Health Organization has declared disease (COVID-19) due to infection

41

with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) as pandemic. As

42

of August 6, 2020, more than 18 million confirmed cases and 720,000 fatalities have been

43

reported worldwide [1]. The SARS-CoV-2 virion includes four structural elements

44

identified as the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [2,

45

3]. The S protein forms a homotrimer on the virion surface and triggers viral entry into

46

target cells via interactions between its receptor binding domain and the specific host

47

receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4, 5]. Two pathways have been

48

proposed for virion entry into cells; these include direct fusion at the plasma membrane

49

mediated by the host type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2, and endocytic

50

entry that relies on the actions of the lysosomal protease, cathepsin [6]. SARS-CoV-2

51

utilizes both entry pathways for infection of cells that express TMPRSS2, while

52

TMPRSS2-deficient cells permit viral entry exclusively via the cathepsin-dependent

53

endosome pathway [6].

54

The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 includes a discriminative polybasic cleavage motif

55

(RRAR) at the S1/S2 cleavage site which is not present in the S proteins of related

56

coronaviruses, including human SARS-CoV (Figs. 1a and 1b) [7, 8]. This polybasic motif

57

has been shown to facilitate the cleavage of nascent S protein into S1 and S2 subunits by

58

the host furin protease; cleavage is critical for formation of cell syncytia and for efficient

59

entry of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein into

60

host target cells [7]. Consequently, the polybasic cleavage motif of the SARS-CoV-2 S

61

protein has emerged as a feature of significant interest and importance.

62

In this study, we have examined the properties of SARS-CoV-2 variants which have

63

developed mutations at the S protein cleavage site during routine passage in cell culture.

64

The variants with S gene mutations were unable to utilize the virus entry pathway mediated

65

by TMPRSS2 and exhibited a more limited range of cell tropism compared to the wild-type

66

strain. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 variants with S gene mutations emerged rapidly and became

67

the dominant in the virus population after two passages in Vero cells, which are common

68

cell targets used for the study of SARS-CoV-2.

Results

71

Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants

72

Vero cells express ACE2 under homeostatic conditions and are susceptible to infection

73

with SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10] and this cell line is used widely for isolation and propagation of

74

SARS-CoV-2. Currently, Vero cells engineered to maintain stable expression of TMPRSS2

75

(Vero-TMPRSS2) are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection [11]. After several

76

passages, we detected variant viruses with mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage site in the S

77

gene of SARS-CoV-2 (S gene mutants) when virions were propagated in Vero cells. In

78

contrast, these were not detected in viruses maintained in Vero-TMPRSS2. In order to

79

characterize the properties of the S gene mutant viruses, we isolated four variant clones

80

from progeny virus pools by limiting dilution. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that

81

three of the isolated virus clones (del1, del2, and del3) had in-frame deletions; the fourth

82

variant (R685H) had a single nucleotide substitution at the S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. S1).

83

Multiple alignment analysis revealed that del1 and del2 had deletions of 10 and 7 amino

84

acid residues, respectively, and these included the polybasic cleavage motif (RRAR) at the

85

S protein S1/S2 cleavage site. In contrast, del3 had a deletion of 3 amino acids at a point

86

immediately downstream of RRAR motif (Fig. 1b). In R685H, the RRAR motif was

87

substituted with RRAH (Fig. 1b).

88

At 3 days post infection, viruses with S gene mutations generated smaller plaques on

89

Vero-TMPRSS2 cells compared with the parent (WT) strain (Fig. 1c). Earlier reports

90

revealed that the introduction of mutations at the polybasic cleavage motif prevented

91

effective cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [4, 7]. As all mutants isolated in our study

92

included deletions or substitutions within or near the polybasic cleavage motif, we

93

evaluated the extent of cleavage of the nascent S protein by immunoblotting with an anti-S

94

monoclonal antibody which detects both full-length S protein and its S2 cleavage product.

95

Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were susceptible to the infection with WT and S gene mutant viruses

96

and infection was associated with comparable levels of nascent viral N and full-length S

97

proteins (Fig. 1d). However, S2 protein was detected only in cells infected with WT virus.

98

Notably, while the polybasic RRAR motif of del3 remained intact, S protein cleavage in

99

this mutant variant was impaired in a manner similar to that observed among the other S

100

gene mutants. Taken together, these results suggested that amino acid deletion or

101

substitution in or near the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage site prevented S protein cleavage

102

and resulted in decreased plaque sizes.

104
105

Cell tropism of S gene mutants
We then investigated the tropism and growth of S gene mutant viruses in different cell

106

lines. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Vero and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were

107

both highly susceptible to infection with WT and all S gene mutant viruses (Fig. 2a).

108

However, formation of characteristic cell syncytia was observed only in Vero-TMPRSS2

109

cells infected with WT virus (white arrowheads in Fig. 2a). The human lung epithelial

110

Calu-3 and colon epithelial Caco-2 cell lines are known to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

111

infection [10]. However, compared to WT virus, few to no Calu-3 or Caco-2 cells were

112

susceptible to infection with any of the S gene mutant viruses (Fig. 2a). Likewise, although

113

the virus titers of S gene mutants generated in infected Vero and Vero-TMPRSS2 cells

114

were similar to those of the WT virus, titers of S gene mutants were significantly lower

115

those of the WT virus in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells, and these results correlate with the

116

findings of immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 2b). Notably, the virus titers from Calu-3

117

cells inoculated with del1 and del2 were under the limits of detection at all time points.

118

These results indicate that both Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells were less susceptible to infection

119

with S gene mutants compared to WT virus. This was intriguing, given that both Calu-3

120

and Caco-2 cells express endogenous ACE2 [9, 12] and TMPRSS2 [13, 14].

121

Human kidney 293T cells lack ACE2 expression and its exogenous introduction

122

confers susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection [6, 15]. To examine the receptor usage by

123

the S gene mutants, 293T cells at baseline and 293T cells stably expressing human ACE2

124

(293T-ACE2) cells were inoculated with WT virus or S gene mutants. Heterologous

125

expression of ACE2 resulted in a marked increase susceptibility to infection with the WT

126

and the S gene mutant viruses (Figs. 3a and 3b) and titers of S gene mutants were

127

equivalent or higher than that those of the WT virus infection of 293T-ACE2 cells (Fig. 3b).

128

These results suggest that ACE2 facilitates cell entry and infection of both S gene mutants

129

and the WT virus.

130
131
132

Effect of chemical inhibitors on entry of S gene mutants
Given that there were no differences with respect to ACE2 usage, we next examined

133

whether S gene mutants utilize one or both cellular entry pathways. These experiments

134

were performed with camostat mesylate, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, and E-64d, an inhibitor

135

of cathepsin B/L. These agents are known to inhibit cellular entry of coronaviruses,

136

including SARS-CoV-2 [6, 16]. Camostat inhibited WT SARS-CoV-2 entry into

137

Vero-TMPRSS2 cells; however E-64d had no impact on this process (Fig. 4a). These

138

findings were consistent with a previous study that reported that TMPRSS2-mediated entry

139

was the dominant pathway employed by SARS-CoV-2 in TMPRSS2-expressing cells [6].

140

In contrast, camostat had no impact on entry of the S gene mutant, del2, into

141

Vero-TMPRSS2 cells but E-64d treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in del2

142

entry (Fig. 4a). These results suggested that S gene mutant, del2, can enter Vero-TMPRSS2

143

cells via cathepsin-dependent endocytosis but not the TMPRSS2-mediated fusion pathway.

144

Parental Vero cells that do not express TMPRSS2 were inoculated with S gene mutant

145

viruses in the presence of camostat and/or E-64d. Addition of E-64d inhibited the entry of

146

all S gene mutants into both Vero-TMPRSS2 and parent Vero cells; by contrast, camostat

147

had no impact on S gene mutant entry into these target cells (Fig. 4b). These results

148

suggested that, in contrast to WT virus, S gene mutants enter into cells via

149

cathepsin-dependent endocytosis only, regardless of the presence or absence of TMPRSS2.

150

Because WT virus and S gene mutants showed different sensitivities to the treatment

151

with camostat, an agent currently under exploration as a candidate antiviral for clinical use

152

[17], we also examined the impact of other antiviral agents including nafamostat (a

153

TMPRSS2 inhibitor) [18, 19] and remdesivir (a nucleotide analog) [20, 21]. Antiviral

154

effects in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were estimated by a cell viability assay based on the

155

generation of cytopathic effects [22]. Consistent with previous studies [18, 19], nafamostat

156

showed higher antiviral efficacy against WT virus than was observed in response to

157

camostat; however, nafamostat had no antiviral activity against the S gene mutants (Table

158

1). In contrast, remdesivir inhibited infection of both WT and S gene mutants with similar

159

EC50 values (Table 1). These results indicated that S gene mutants are resistant to the

160

treatment with TMPRRSS2 inhibitors, but are sensitive to antivirals that target post entry

161

processes.

162
163
164

Frequencies of S gene mutants in SARS-CoV-2 propagation
In an effort to understand the selection mechanisms underlying the generation of these

165

mutant variants, we estimated the frequency of S gene mutants in virus population of

166

SARS-CoV-2 that had undergone serial passage in cultured cells. SARS-CoV-2 from an

167

original virus stock was underwent passage once (P1) to four times (P4) in Vero or up to

168

eight times (P8) in Vero-TMPRSS2. Nucleotide sequence heterogeneity at the S1/S2

169

cleavage site was determined by deep sequencing and variant call analysis. More than one

170

million sequence reads from each passaged sample were mapped onto the S1/S2 cleavage

171

site and analyzed for sequence variation. No sequence variants were observed in virus

172

populations until P8 in Vero-TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5a). In contrast, nucleotide sequence

173

deletions around the S1/S2 cleavage site corresponding to del1 and del2 mutants were

174

observed in all three biological replicates of SARS-CoV-2 populations passaged in Vero

175

cells (Fig. 5a). Notably, WT nucleotide sequences were detected in fewer than 20% of the

176

isolates evaluated at P2 and the WT was completely replaced with S gene mutants at P4 in

177

Vero cells. These results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero cells results in a

178

profound selection favoring the S gene mutants. S gene mutants del3 and R685H were not

179

identified in the virus populations from P1 to P4. An additional variant del4 with a deletion

180

of 5 amino acids at a point immediately upstream of the RRAR motif (Figs. S2a and S2b),

181

was detected as a minor variant in sample #1 at P2. These results suggest that these specific

182

mutations occur only at low frequency.

183

We then determined the frequency of S gene mutants in virus populations passaged in

184

Calu-3 and Caco-2, which are cells that endogenously express TMPRSS2 [13, 14], and also

185

in 293T-ACE2 that do not express TMPRSS2 [6]. No S gene mutants were identified in

186

SARS-CoV-2 passaged in Calu-3 and Caco-2 until P4; by contrast, S gene mutants

187

emerged at P2 in 293T-ACE2 cells (Fig. 5b). We also identified an additional variant

188

R682P carrying a single amino acid substitution at the RRAR motif (Figs. S2a and S2b) at

189

P3 and P4 in 293T-ACE2 cells (Fig. 5b). Taken together, these results suggest a strong

190

association between TMPRSS2 deficiency and the emergence of S gene mutants.

191

Trypsin is a serine protease that is typically added to culture medium to induce

192

cleavage and activation of viral proteins, including the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of

193

influenza virus and the fusion (F) protein of paramyxovirus to promote growth in

194

TMPRSS2-deficient cells [23]. Recent studies report that trypsin treatment activates

195

SARS-CoV-2 S protein and induces syncytia formation in cells that transiently express the

196

virus S protein [7, 24]. As such, we examined whether exogenously added trypsin could

197

compensate for TMPRSS2 deficiency and thus inhibit the emergence of S gene mutants

198

during SARS-CoV-2 propagation in Vero cells. Deep sequencing analysis revealed that S

199

gene mutants did emerge and accounted for the majority of the virus population after P2 in

200

Vero cells cultured in serum-free medium with added trypsin (Fig. S3); these results

201

indicate that exogenous protease activity cannot replace TMPRSS2 in its role in promoting

202

SARS-CoV-2 replication.

203
204
205

Discussion
In this study, we isolated S gene mutants from SARS-CoV-2 WK-521, a strain isolated

206

from a clinical case in Japan [11], via serial passage in Vero cells. Other studies have

207

reported viruses with S gene mutations, including amino acid deletions and substitution at

208

the S1/S2 cleavage site from clinical isolates in Australia [20], China [25], and England

209

[26] and these emerged during cultivation in Vero cells or in its derivative, Vero/hSLAM,

210

which are cells that do not express TMPRSS2. However, the virological properties of the S

211

gene mutants remains to be poorly investigated. Our deep sequencing analysis revealed that

212

S gene mutants emerged at P1 and rapidly became the dominant variant within the virus

213

populations that emerged from Vero cell passage. Taken together, our findings indicate that

214

replication of SARS-CoV-2 in TMPRSS2-deficient Vero cells results in the selection of S

215

gene mutants; as such, passage in this cell line is technically inappropriate, as it becomes

216

difficult to impossible to maintain SARS-CoV-2 with the S1/S2 cleavage site in its intact

217

form.

218

The present study characterized S gene mutants as SARS-CoV-2 variants that generate

219

small plaques and that have a narrow range of cell tropism. The phenotypic alterations of S

220

gene mutants might be explained by noting that the S gene mutants were unable enter target

221

cells via direct fusion mediated by TMPRSS2. Indeed, a previous study demonstrated that

222

the polybasic cleavage motif at the S1/S2 cleavage site was indispensable for the entry of

223

VSV-pseudotyped viruses into Calu-3 cells that expressed TMPRSS2 [7]. Further studies

224

using infectious S gene mutants will provide new insights into the role of the polybasic

225

amino acid motif at the S1/S2 cleavage site with respect to both SARS-CoV-2 infection and

226

its pathogenicity.

227

At this time, many studies are conducted using SARS-CoV-2 propagated in Vero cells.

228

Considering the very real possibility that these virus stocks will accumulate S gene

229

mutations, researchers must pay careful attention to the passage history of any working

230

stocks of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we must be very objective when interpreting the results

231

from studies using Vero-passaged virus, especially those focused on S protein cleavage,

232

virus entry and on cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2.

Cells

236

Calu-3 (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (MEM)

237

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Caco-2 (RIKEN BRC) cells were

238

maintained in Eagle’s MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and non-essential amino acids.

239

Vero E6 (ATCC) and 293T (JCRB cell bank) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s

244

Generation of TMPRSS2- and ACE2-expressing cells
Human TMPRSS2 and ACE2 genes were cloned into the self-inactivating lentiviral

245

vector plasmids, CSII-CMV-MCS-IRES2-Bsd (RIKEN BRC) and pLVSIN-CMV Pur

246

(Takara Bio), respectively. The resulting constructs were named

247

CSII-CMV-TMPRSS2-IRES2-Bsd and pLVSIN-CMV-ACE2-Pur. For lentiviral vector

248

preparation, 293T cells were co-transfected with the lentiviral vector plasmid and Lentiviral

249

High Titer Packaging Mix (Takara Bio). The culture supernatants containing lentiviral

250

vectors were used to inoculate target cells. Vero cells stably expressing TMPRSS2

251

(Vero-TMPRSS2) and 293T stably expressing ACE2 (293T-ACE2) were selected in the

255

SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 strain was provided by Dr. Shimojima (National Institute of

256

Infectious Diseases, Japan); the original stock of this virus (wild type, WT) was prepared

257

by inoculation of Vero-TMPRSS2 cells with Mynox mycoplasma elimination reagent

258

(Minerva Biolabs) [11]. After several passages of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells, the S mutant

259

viruses in the culture supernatant were cloned by limiting dilution and propagated in Vero

260

cells. The nucleotide sequences of S genes of all working stocks were confirmed by

261

RT-PCR and direct sequencing methods.

E-64d (Abcam) for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and cultured in fresh

300

culture medium with 2% FBS. At 6 h after inoculation, total RNA was extracted from cells

301

with Direct-zol-96 RNA Kit or Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research). RNA

302

samples were subjected to qRT-PCR analysis using AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit

303

(Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primer and probe sequences targeting

304

SARS-CoV-2 N gene included: 5′–CACATTGGCACCCGCAATC–3′,

305

5′–GAGGAACGAGAAGAGGCTTG–3′, and

306

5′-FAM–ACTTCCTCA/ZEN/AGGAACAACATTGCCA/–IBFQ–3′ [27]. The primer and

307

Cytopathic effect-based cell viability assays

310

The MTT (3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) (Nacalai

311

Tesque) assay was performed to evaluate cell viability following viral infection according

312

to methods previously described [29]. Camostat, E-64d, nafamostat (FUJIFILM Wako Pure

313

chemical) and remdesivir (MedChemExpress) were serially diluted 2-fold increments in

314

duplicates and plated on 96-well microplates in MEM containing 2% FBS.

315

Vero-TMPRSS2 were infected with either WT or S mutants of SARS-CoV-2 at 4-10

316

TCID50 and added to the plates. Plates were incubated at for 3 days, and CPE was

317

determined for calculation of 50% endpoints using MTT assay. The concentration

318

achieving 50% inhibition of cell viability (effective concentration; EC50) was calculated.

321

The original stock of SARS-CoV-2 strain WK-521 was serially passaged in Vero,

322

Vero-TMPRSS2, Calu-3, Caco-2, and 293T-ACE2 cells in complete culture medium or

323

(for Vero) in serum free DMEM supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml trypsin (Gibco); three

324

biological replicates were included for each of the cell lines. Virus propagation was

325

performed in 12-well plates; 20 μl (2%) of culture supernatant collected at day 3 post

326

infection was used to inoculate naïve cells for virus passage. RNA was extracted from the

327

culture supernatant after each passage using a High Pure Viral RNA kit (Roche

328

Diagnostics). For deep sequencing of the S1/S2 cleavage site of the viral S gene, amplicon

329

sequence libraries were fused with Ion A and the Ion Express barcode sequence at the

330

5′-region; truncated P1 adapters at 3′-region were generated by nested RT-PCR with a

331

fusion method according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fusion methods from Ion

332

Torrent; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Information on the fusion PCR primers is available

333

upon request. For deep sequencing, emulsion PCR was performed with the Ion PI Hi-Q

334

OT2 200 kit (Ion Torrent). Sequencing was performed using the Ion PI Hi-Q Sequencing

335

200 kit, the Ion PI Chip Kit v3 and the Ion Proton sequencer (Ion Torrent). After mapping

336

the reads to the reference sequence (GenBank accession no. LC522975), sequence variants

337

including deletions, insertions, and substitutions were identified using the Torrent Variant

338

Caller plugin with indel minimum allele frequency cutoff of 0.02 (Ion Torrent).

339
340

Statistical analysis

341

One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s test was employed to determine statistical

342

significance.

Fig. 1. Isolation of SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants
(a) Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Full-length S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2
proteins at the S1/S2 cleavage site. Functional domains (RBD, receptor binding domain; RBM, receptor
binding motif) are highlighted. (b) Multiple amino acid sequence alignments focused on the S1/S2
cleavage site of wild type (WT) and isolated mutant viruses (del1, del2, del3 and R685H). Amino acid
substitutions and deletions are shown as gray boxes, and the polybasic cleavage motif (RARR) at the
S1/S2 cleavage site is highlighted in red. A red arrowhead indicates S1/S2 cleavage site. (c) Plaque
formation for SARS-CoV-2 WT and isolated mutants grown in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells on 6 well plates.
(d) Detection of virus S and N proteins in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells infected with WT or isolated mutants.
The full-length S and cleaved S2 proteins are indicated by closed and open arrowheads, respectively.

Fig. 4. Impact of biochemical inhibitors on cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutants
(a) Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 WT or del2 mutant in the presence of varying
concentrations of the TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat, or the cathepsin B/L inhibitor, E-64d, for 1h. At 6 h
post-inoculation, the relative levels of viral N protein RNA were evaluated quantitatively by qRT-PCR.
(b) Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 WT or S gene mutants in the
presence of 50 μM camostat and/or 25 μM E-64d for 1 h. At 6 h post-inoculation, the relative levels of
viral N protein RNA were quantified by qRT-PCR. Cellular β-actin mRNA levels were used as reference
controls. The values shown are mean
SD of triplicate samples. One-way analysis of variance with
Dunnett’s test was used to determine the statistical significance between the responses to treatment with
inhibitors and the no-treatment controls; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
