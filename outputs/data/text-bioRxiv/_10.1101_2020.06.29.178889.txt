Abstract
COVID-19 is undoubtedly the most impactful viral disease of the current century, afflicting
millions worldwide. As yet, there is not an approved vaccine, as well as limited options from
existing drugs for treating this disease. We hypothesized that combining drugs with independent
mechanisms of action could result in synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Using in silico approaches,
we prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs with potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and then
tested them in vitro. Overall, we identified 16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of
which were both synergistic and antagonistic in a dose-dependent manner. Among the 16
synergistic cases, combinations of nitazoxanide with three other compounds (remdesivir,
amodiaquine and umifenovir) were the most notable, all exhibiting significant synergy against
SARS-CoV-2. The combination of nitazoxanide, an FDA-approved drug, and remdesivir, FDA
emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19, demonstrate a strong synergistic
interaction. Notably, the combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine demonstrated strong
antagonism. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of both drug repurposing and
preclinical testing of drug combinations for potential therapeutic use against SARS-CoV-2
infections.

Introduction
Drug combinations have been used with great success in the past to treat infectious diseases, a
notable example being human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).1 Drug combinations are particularly
useful in treating viral infections due to the fact that they can substantially lower the risk of the
development of resistance to any one drug, and have demonstrated marked success against various
viral diseases in the past.1,2 Additionally, the antiviral action of the drug combination may be
stronger than either drug alone, a phenomenon known as synergy. Antiviral synergy has been
previously illustrated for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV),2–4 HIV,5 herpes simplex virus
(HSV),6,7 poliovirus,8 Ebola virus,9 Zika virus,10 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).11 Often
the rationale for why such synergism occurs remains unclear – it is extraordinarily difficult to
provide explanations for existing synergistic or antagonistic drug combinations without prior,
extensive, experimental investigations.12

For antiviral drug synergy predictions, some past evidence suggests that combinations of antiviral
drugs that are of different classes, have varied mechanisms of action, and act upon different stages
of the virus life cycle, are more likely to be synergistic.2,3,13 Though there have been many
compounds suggested against SARS-CoV-2 tested in vitro, many of these drugs are only being
evaluated as single agents, according to ClinicalTrials.gov. These include numerous research
groups evaluating compounds in enzymatic and cellular assays to determine antiviral activity.14–23
Comparatively, there has been limited systematic screening of drug combinations.24

Meanwhile, the situation in clinical trials is somewhat different. Of the 2,341 clinical trials relevant
to COVID-19 as of June 27, 2020, ca. 100 describe drug combinations. However, many of these

trials are evaluating the same drug repurposing combinations, e.g., lopinavir+ritonavir or
azithromycin+hydroxychloroquine.25 Perhaps the most noteworthy antiviral drug combination to
date has been lopinavir+ritonavir (formulated as a single therapeutic, Kaletra), which has been
tested in clinical trials with and without Interferon-β1b.26 This Phase II trial for a triple antiviral
therapy combining interferon-β1b, lopinavir–ritonavir, and ribavirin was shown to shorten the
duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.26
However, a recent study assessing the effectiveness of the lopinavir+ritonavir combination in
treating COVID-19 has noted that administration of lopinavir+ritonavir in COVID-19 patients
showed no benefit.27 As of June 27, 2020, no combination therapy has yet yielded positive results
in Phase III randomized clinical trials.28

While there are many ongoing or upcoming clinical trials testing combinations to treat COVID19, few have undergone extensive preclinical studies prior to their combination in patients. Due to
a lack of such studies, more information is needed on the combinatorial use of antivirals and other
drugs against SARS-CoV-2 in order to (1) more efficiently prioritize synergistic combinations for
translation into clinical use; and (2) flag antagonistic combinations prior to their evaluation in the
preclinical stage. To this point, we have recently used data and text mining approaches to propose
drug combinations for repurposing against SARS-CoV-2,29 operating on the assumption that
combinations of drugs with differing mechanisms might exhibit synergistic activity. The goal of
this study is to report the antiviral activity, synergy, and antagonism of 73 binary combinations of
31 drugs identified earlier29 as demonstrated in an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic assay.

Methods
Selection of drug combinations
We applied a combination of text mining (Chemotext),30 knowledge mining (ROBOKOP
knowledge graphs),31 and machine learning (QSAR)32 in the search for existing drugs with
possible activities against SARS-CoV-2. A detailed description of our study design is provided in
our recent paper and is also depicted in Fig. 1.29 Briefly, we first identified a list of 76 individual
drug candidates for repurposing in combination therapy against COVID-19 using aforementioned
techniques. Here we selected some of the hits from virtual screening of DrugBank33 and NPC34
collections by our QSAR models of SARS-CoV Mpro inhibition35 and all the drugs found in
Chemotext and ROBOKOP searching for “SARS”, “Coronaviridae”, etc. This resulted in 76
individual drugs that may potentially create 2580 binary and 70300 ternary combinations. In this
study we will describe only the binary combinations.

only 73 binary combinations. 95 ternary combinations identified in a similar fashion will be

Then, we applied Chemotext and ROBOKOP to evaluate the potential combinations of selected
drugs. We also applied the recently developed web-platform COVID-KOP36 to refine the original
list of combinations. Here, we considered the mechanism(s) of action (if known) and the target(s)
of the drugs (a recent review37 was extremely helpful here) to identify potential synergistic effects
and avoid antagonistic interactions.24,38 We aimed (whenever possible) to prioritize combinations
of drugs with different mechanisms of action and/or targeting the virus at different stages of its
lifecycle (higher confidence hits) or at least acting upon distinct viral protein targets, which
increases the probability of synergy between drugs.39,40 This rationale behind combination
selection is depicted in Fig. 2 through the example of umifenovir and emetine, which are suspected
to act upon different stages of the viral lifecycle (see Fig. 2).

selection, i.e., interference with different steps of the COVID-19 lifecycle. All known targets and
interactions were taken from the literature and are not necessarily specific to SARS-CoV-2.
Umifenovir’s proposed mechanisms of action involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis,41,42 lipids
and protein residues,43 dynamin-2-induced membrane scission,41 and endosome acidification.41
Emetine’s proposed mechanisms of action involve RNA replication/RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase44,45 and the host cell lysosome.45 The viral lifecycle of SARS-CoV-2 was inspired by
Fig. 1. of da Costa et. al 2020.46

Next, we used Chemotext to determine if these compounds had been tested together before. One
capability of Chemotext is finding papers that share two search terms, in this case, the names of
compound #1 and compound #2, and returning these common papers by the MeSH terms found in
these papers. These shared MeSH terms, depicting proteins, chemicals, etc. further allow us to
hypothesize on how these two compounds may be connected, namely via shared biochemical
pathways. Cheminformatics models were then used to further exclude combinations with
undesirable drug-drug interactions.47,48 Subsequently, combinations were manually curated to
exclude artifacts as well as compounds undesired or contraindicated in the case of pneumonia (e.g.,
paclitaxel, bleomycin), or viral infection (e.g., baricitinib). In the end, we prioritized 73 binary
combinations of 32 drugs for further experimental testing. Computational approaches used for
prioritization of combinations and mechanistic explanations are briefly outlined below.

Chemotext is a publicly-available web server that mines the published literature in PubMed in the
form of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms.30 Chemotext was used for elucidation of the
relationships between drugs and their combinations, targets, and SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
from the papers annotated Medline/PubMed database.

ROBOKOP49 and COVID-KOP36. ROBOKOP is a data-mining tool developed within
Biomedical Data Translator Initiative50 to efficiently query, store, rank and explore sub-graphs of
a complex knowledge graph (KG) for hypothesis generation and scoring. We have used
ROBOKOP in a similar fashion as Chemotext; Chemotext could help the user to find and impute
the connections between drugs, targets, and diseases and ROBOKOP could help explore and score
them. In the middle of the project, COVID-KOP, a new knowledgebase integrating the existing

ROBOKOP biomedical knowledge graph with information from recent biomedical literature on
COVID-19 annotated in the CORD-19 collection,51 was developed and thus we began to utilize it
instead of ROBOKOP.

QSAR models developed by us earlier were used for selection of drugs35,48 that could be
repurposed as combinations and exclusion of potential drug-drug interactions and side effects.52
All the models were developed according to the best practices of QSAR modeling32,53,54 with a
special attention paid for data curation55–57 and rigorous external validation.58 Mixture-specific
descriptors and validation techniques59 specially developed for modeling of drug combinations
were utilized for modeling of drug-drug interactions.52

Assay-ready plate production
An in-house software package, Matrix Script Plate Generator (MSPG), was used to create all
necessary files for generation of compound source plates, acoustic dispensing scripts, and plate
maps for each combination in 6 × 6 dose matrix, shown in Fig. 3H. Briefly, we placed single-agent
compounds A and B (1:3 or 1:2 dilution) in orthogonal directions, and used the remaining 25 wells
to measure the combinatorial outcome of A+B with their respective doses.

To generate the compound source plate, a Perkin-Elmer Janus Automated Workstation was used
to transfer compounds from 1.4 mL Matrix 2D barcode tube (sample tube) to the individual wells
of Echo Qualified 384-Well Polypropylene Microplate 2.0**, along with positive and neutral
(DMSO) controls (Labcyte, San Jose, CA). The plates were briefly centrifuged for 2 min at 100×g.
Customized generated input files for the Labcyte acoustic dispenser (Labcyte, San Jose, CA) from
a comma-separated value file that contained the unique plate and well pairings for each of the
initial compound matrix blocks. Compounds were dispensed to generate assay ready plates using
an Access Laboratory Workstation with dual Echo 655 dispensers (Labcyte). Each plate was sealed
with a peel-able aluminium seal, remaining covered until the initiation of the biological assay,
frozen at -80˚C until used for screening.

Viral Cytopathic Effect assay (CPE) and cytotoxicity assay (Tox)
The detailed protocol for the CPE and Tox counter assays are available from NCATS OpenData
portal.23
CPE: https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/assay?aid=14
Tox: https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/assay?aid=15
Briefly, 30 nL of each compound in DMSO was acoustically dispensed into assay ready plates
(ARPs). Media was then added to the plates at 5 μL/well and incubated at room temperature to
dissolve the compounds. Vero E6 cells (selected for high ACE2 expression) were premixed with
SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) at a MOI of 0.002, and were dispensed as 25 mL/well into ARPs
within 5 min in a BSL-3 lab. The final cell density was 4000 cells/well. The cells and virus were
incubated with compounds for 72 hrs, then viability was assayed by ATP content.

For the cytotoxicity assay, ARPs were prepared in the same way as for CPE assay. Then, 5 mL/well
of media was dispensed into assay plates. Vero E6 in media and dispensed into assay plates at 25
μL/well for a final cell density of 4000 cells/well. Assay plates were incubated for 72 hrs at 37 °C,
5% CO2, 90% humidity, before viability was assayed by ATP content.

Data analysis
CPE and Tox activity were normalized using independent control wells on each plate, so activity
values were not strictly bounded between [0, 100]. For CPE assay, DMSO+virus was treated as
the neutral control, whereas DMSO-only (no virus) served as the positive control. A Calpain
inhibitor IV was used as batch control (2ug/ml final assay concentration). Normalized CPE activity
= 1 - (x - neutralCtrl) / (positiveCtrl - neutralCtrl) × 100%. For Tox assay, DMSO-only was used
as the neutral control and media-only wells (no cell) as the negative control. Normalized Tox
activity = (x - negativeCtrl) / (neutralCtrl - negativeCtrl) × 100%. Plate-level data was pivoted to
block-level data and replicates were median-aggregated.

Synergism and antagonism from a 6 × 6 block were evaluated using the highest single agent model
(HSA).60 Given a dose combination Aconc1 + Bconc2,
HSA(Aconc1+Bconc2) = activity(Aconc1+Bconc2) – MIN{activity(Aconc1), activity(Bconc2)}
Synergism: HSA(*) < 0
Antagonism: HSA(*) > 0
Additivity: HSA(*) = 0
To account for dose-dependent synergism and antagonism, we analyzed the negative HSA
(HSA.neg) and positive HSA (HSA.pos) separately. The overall synergism (or antagonism) given

a 6 × 6 block was calculated as the sum of all negative (or positive) HSA(Aconc*+Bconc*) across the
non-toxic dose combinations (defined as Tox activity > 50).
Since CPE activity showed a non-linear variation across different activity levels (Fig. 3B), which
made it more difficult to ascertain the reproducibility of synergy/antagonism (given limited
resources), we evaluated the smoothness of the 2D activity landscape. Smoothness was calculated
as the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between the actual and gaussian smoothed (σ = 2)
landscape. If a block had RMSD(observed, gaussian smoothed) > 20 or less than 25 non-toxic CPE
values, inconclusive synergism/antagonism was recorded. Otherwise, synergism and/or
antagonism were recorded if HSA.neg < -100 and/or HSA.pos > 100.

Results
Performance of matrix screening
In total, we screened 73 pairwise combinations in a 6×6 dose matrix format, which involved two
biological batches (cell and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and two assays (cytopathic effect and cytotoxicity
against Vero-E6 cells) across 42 384-well plates including replicates (Supplementary File 1 and
Supplementary File 4). The Z’ factor was robust across batches and assays (all Z’ > 0.7, Fig. 3A).
Each batch was assessed by a benchmark compound collection including five known antivirals,
performed at an independent site. We did not observe significant drift of potencies or efficacies
between batches, except for hydroxychloroquine, which consistently resulted in inconclusive dose
response curves (Fig. 3C-G and Supplementary File 2). In addition, we performed a third QC to
check the reproducibility across all available replicates in CPE or Tox assays (Fig. 3C). CPE
activity showed a biphasic trend between median activity and standard deviation: most
reproducible (StDev < 20) when activity is extreme (activity < 20 or > 75), and less reproducible

in between (blue points). This is probably due to the high sensitivity to technical/biological
variations when the concentration is close to the EC50. This biphasic reproducibility of CPE
activity also highlights the importance of using a dose matrix, instead of a single dose combination,
to enhance the confidence of synergism/antagonism findings. In contrast, Tox activity is highly
reproducible regardless of the median activity (yellow points).

Overview of hits
Since synergism and antagonism might occur simultaneously in a concentration-dependent manner
(see Fig. 7 for an example), we separated the synergism and antagonism analyses using highest
single agent (HSA) synergy model. Within 73 binary combinations of 32 compounds, we identified
16 synergistic and 8 antagonistic combinations, 4 of which displayed both synergistic and
antagonistic interactions at different compound concentrations (Fig. 4 & 5). There are 29
combinations with inconclusive determinations that require additional validation due to
cytotoxicity or the roughness of the activity landscape (see Methods). A summary of the screening
result is available in Supplementary File 4. A map of drug combinations depicting their
synergism/antagonism outcomes is depicted in Fig. 5.

dose response, synergism was separated from antagonism. Synergism is calculated as the sum of
HSA.neg values from non-toxic dose combinations (Tox > 50%), and vice versa. The size of circle
reflected the confidence of the observed synergism/antagonism (bigger circle = less doses were
excluded due to toxicity).The inconclusive blocks (Nnontoxic < 25 or rough activity landscape) were

Next, we investigated whether any drug combinations with different mechanisms of action (MoA)
could offer a greater chance of antiviral synergism or antagonism. A previous study demonstrated
that synergism/antagonism is predictable based on MoA in oncology screening.61 Unfortunately,
we found limited evidence of MoA-associated synergism/antagonism (up to 10 μM) for SARSCoV-2 (Fig. 6). The most antagonistic MoA combination came from the combination of an RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitor (remdesivir) and an antimalarial drug, in which 3
(hydroxychloroquine, amodiaquine and mefloquine) out of 4 appeared to be antagonistic (Fig. 7).
However, the current data are not sufficient to conclusively infer any MoA-associated
synergism/antagonism. We are performing further systematic synergy screening to evaluate
combinations with known mechanisms of action.

Antagonism between remdesivir and lysosomotropic agents
Most notably, our results demonstrate a strong antagonistic effect between remdesivir and
antimalarial drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine, and amodiaquine (Fig. 7). The
most striking antagonism was observed in the combination of the only two drugs ever approved
with FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA): hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir (though we
note the EUA for hydroxychloroquine has been withdrawn by the FDA).62 Our results showed that
10 μM hydroxychloroquine could completely extinguish the antiviral activity of remdesivir in
vitro. The antagonistic effect exerted by hydroxychloroquine could be observed at a concentration
as low as 0.37 μM (Fig. 7A). In contrast to hydroxychloroquine, which only showed antagonism
under 10 μM, mefloquine and amodiaquine could synergize with remdesivir at high concentrations
(Fig. 7B and Fig. 7C). This biphasic interaction pattern (antagonism at low concentration and
synergism at high concentration) ruled out the possibility of direct chemical interaction between
remdesivir and tertiary amines in a mixture.
COVID-KOP was further utilized to seek possible explanations for the observed synergies and
antagonisms in the study. A pertinent use of COVID-KOP is to identify the biological processes
and activities common to two drugs, which could suggest possible common interactions that lead
to antagonism, such as in the case of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, shown in Fig. 8. Analysis
using COVID-KOP showed that hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir are both associated with the
biological process/activity terms: “clathrin-dependent endocytosis”; “viral entry/release into host
cell”; “inflammatory response”; “pH reduction”; “negative regulation of kinase activity”; and
“protein tyrosine kinase activity”, as well as different interleukin receptor (1-2, 6-7, 10) binding
events (see Fig. 8). This computational analysis indicates that these are common terms to both

drugs could interact to cause antagonism. This type of network analysis provides bird’s-eye view
of all the possible pathways or processes implicated in outcomes such as antagonism and
synergism.63 These terms cannot be resolved further; thus, it may be possible that the action of a
protein kinase is involved in the antagonism observed for the combination of remdesivir and
hydroxychloroquine (this is considered further in the Discussion), but it is unclear which specific
protein kinases this entails based solely on COVID-KOP results. It should be noted that with more
widely known compounds, Chemotext, ROBOKOP, and COVID-KOP are more likely to return
shared terms that may not have real significance. That is, given that remdesivir has been mentioned
in many COVID-19 studies that may not necessarily focus on the drug’s mechanism of action, the
connections it has to certain targets may be somewhat spurious. This is also true for
hydroxychloroquine, which was also widely touted as a possible treatment early in the pandemic.

We observed a similar antagonism against remdesivir from another drug with a tertiary amine
moiety, umifenovir (arbidol, antiviral approved in Russia/China), at low concentrations (123 - 370
nM, Fig. 7D). However, umifenovir synergized with remdesivir at high concentrations (3 - 10 μM).
Hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine and amodiaquine are known lysosomotropic agents64,65 and
umifenovir also contains a tertiary amine moiety, suggesting an association between reduced
antiviral efficacy of remdesivir by lysosomotropic amines.

Synergism between nitazoxanide and remdesivir, amodiaquine, or umifenovir
Among 16 synergistic combinations, we observed the strongest synergistic effects in the
combinations containing nitazoxanide, and FDA-approved broad-spectrum antiviral and
antiparasitic drug. The three most synergistic combinations with nitazoxanide, i.e., nitazoxanide +
remdesivir / umifenovir / amodiaquine are shown in Fig. 9. A complete rescue of CPE could be
observed from 0.625 - 5 μM of nitazoxanide when combined with remdesivir / umifenovir /
amodiaquine, where any of these drugs alone could only achieve a maximum 40-60% rescue (Fig.
9A-C). Nitazoxanide is not cytotoxic when concentration is below 5 μM. However, we observed
a mild toxicity (~20%) of nitazoxanide at 10 μM (Supplementary File 3), which may explain the
vanishment of synergy at this concentration.

Discussion
Combining modern computational techniques and experimental approaches, we have identified
sixteen synergistic antiviral combinations (see Fig. 4). Somewhat unexpectedly, our results also
revealed an antagonism between remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, the two drugs approved with
FDA Emergency Use Authorization for treatment of COVID-19 (the EUA for hydroxychloroquine
has since been rejected, as of June 15, 202062). Remdesivir also exhibits antagonism with
lysosomotropic agents and some other drugs. These findings demonstrate the importance of
preclinical research investigating antiviral drug combinations prior to their application in patients,
as well as the utility of data and text mining approaches to explore MoAs underlying
synergism/antagonism within the context of COVID-19. The approach offered here indicates that
when seeking synergistic antiviral drug combination therapies, it is useful to combine drugs that
act upon different parts of the viral lifecycle.66 These data also emphasize the utility of drug
repurposing in treating COVID-19, but also its pitfalls; namely, while individual drugs may be
safe for use in patients, combinations of these drugs may not exhibit the same safety or efficacy
profile. Lack of preclinical studies on combinations prior to their administration in patients may
significantly increase the risk of antagonism and undesirable side effects. The matrix screening
platform presented in this study is an efficient, data-driven method for prioritizing synergistic
combinations and flagging undesirable drug-drug interactions.

For instance, our method was successful in identifying the antagonistic effect of remdesivir and
hydroxychloroquine in combination. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue prodrug, which inhibits
SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) through inducing delayed chain
termination.67 Although the key enzymes required to activate remdesivir into its active

triphosphate form have not been reported, we hypothesize that remdesivir shares, at least partially,
a similar activation pathway with GS-465124, a metabolite from nucleotide prodrug GS-6620 for
hepatitis C virus, based on the chemical similarity (Fig. 10).68 Both remdesivir and GS-465124 are
adenosine-like phosphoramidates, with the only difference being a methyl group on the 2’ pentose
ring. Therefore, remdesivir is also likely to be hydrolyzed into alanine metabolite (GS-704277)
intracellularly by cathepsin A, akin to GS-465124.68 Since cathepsin A is an acidic pH-dependent
serine protease strictly located in lysosome, the lysosomotropic agents such as hydroxychloroquine
may reduce the amount of active metabolite by increasing lysosomal pH.69 More mechanistic
studies of remdesivir are in progress at NCATS, utilizing label-free mass spectra to elucidate the
exact mechanisms underlying this striking antagonism.

It has been demonstrated previously63 that network-based approaches investigating shared
biochemical pathways between possible drug combinations are helpful in predicting synergistic
combinations and may be useful in predicting the mechanism of action behind observed drug
synergism/antagonism. COVID-KOP, a tool recently developed by our group,36 integrates existing
biochemical knowledge with that contained in literature on COVID-19 in the form of knowledge
graphs. Analysis using COVID-KOP also suggests that the mechanism of action for the
antagonism of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine could be specific to the pathways involved in
viral entry/egress from cells, as well as in lysosomal acidification (“pH reduction” term), the latter
which is consistent with the activation pathway hypothesis detailed above. Additionally, these two
drugs were also associated with protein kinase activity, and specifically negative regulation of
kinase activity, indicating that a protein kinase recruited during viral infection could interfere with
metabolic products of either drug, resulting in antagonism. A brief literature search showed that
hydroxychloroquine is an established inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β),70–72 a
serine-threonine kinase that is known to regulate the replication of viruses including dengue virus273 and SARS-CoV.70 In a recent study, in the later stages of infection with dengue virus-2, viral
titres were shown to be reduced upon inhibition of GSK-3β.73 It has likewise been demonstrated
by Wu et al.70 that GSK-3 regulates the lifecycle of SARS-CoV and is important in SARS-CoV N
protein phosphorylation. Wu et al.70 further demonstrated that treatment with kenpaullone, a GSK3β inhibitor, in turn downregulated SARS-CoV RNA synthesis, and thus hypothesized that
phosphorylated N protein likely constitutes part of the viral replication complex in
coronaviruses.74,75 While remdesivir has no pertinent links to GSK-3β in the literature, it is known
that remdesivir inhibits the action of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

(RdRp).76 Thus, our computational analysis suggests that hydroxychloroquine’s inhibition of
GSK-3β may play a role in its antagonism of remdesivir.

It should be mentioned that these biological process and activity terms do not provide further
information on what specific protein kinase is involved. Thus, we suggest that these stages of the
viral lifecycle, as well as kinase activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection, should be investigated in
further explorations of antagonism mechanisms for hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir.

Another compound tested in combinations in our study was amodiaquine, a potent 4-aminoquinoline compound clinically used for the treatment of malaria. It is structurally related to
chloroquine, and both are suspected to act through the blocking heme detoxification in the parasite
digestive food vacuole (a lysosome like, acidic compartment central to the metabolism of the
parasite where hemoglobin is degraded to provide amino acids for parasite metabolism77). Indeed,
amodiaquine has been reported to interact with μ-oxo dimers of heme ((FeIII-protoporphyrin
IX)2O) in vitro. The major active metabolite of amodiaquine, monodesethyl-amodiaquine, is
rapidly produced via hepatic P450 enzyme conversion in vivo. This metabolite has a half-life in
blood plasma of 9–18 days and reaches a peak concentration of ~500 nM 2 hours after oral
administration. By contrast, amodiaquine has a half-life of ~3 hours, attaining a peak concentration
of ~25 nM within 30 minutes of oral administration.78

We have observed a notable synergism for combinations of nitazoxanide with remdesivir,
umifenovir, or amodiaquine (Fig. 9). Nitazoxanide is an FDA approved, bioavailable, broadspectrum anti-infective drug, which recently has been investigated for use against SARS-CoV-2

owing to its previously established anti-coronaviral activities.79 It was originally identified as a
potential antiviral drug repurposing candidate against SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 of about 2 μM in
a focused compound screening including remdesivir and chloroquine.76 Previous studies have
shown that nitazoxanide is able to activate PKR or/and RIG-I, thus inducing type-I interferon
production and signalling in Ebola and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).80 SARS-CoV-2 is known
for its unique immunopathology of reduced production of, but extra sensitivity to, type-I/III
interferon.81 Interferon-β1b combined with antiviral cocktail (lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin) has
shown promising synergy in shortening the duration of viral shedding according to a Phase II
randomized trial for early COVID-19 treatment.26 Taken together, current knowledge suggests an
interferon-inducing mechanism of nitazoxanide in vitro. This putative mechanism is also
consistent with the broad-spectrum synergy in our matrix screen.

The concentration at which we observed synergy with remdesivir (>1.25 µM, equivalent to 0.383
mg/L) is achievable in plasma and lung trough even at low doses.82 Nitazoxanide is well tolerated
and there is no report of any significant adverse effects from healthy adults.83 As of June 18, 2020,
there are 18 nitazoxanide trials (used as monotherapy or combination with other antivirals)
registered in clinicaltrials.gov for COVID-19. Moreover, the combination of nitazoxanide with
remdesivir looks the most promising from clinical perspective because both drugs would
potentially be available for use for the treatment of COVID-19 (nitazoxanide is FDA-approved
and remdesivir has an emergency use authorization).

lopinavir/ritonavir87 were reported. However, all the trials above are still recruiting or not yet
recruiting. Given the common use of some of our compounds in clinical trials, it might be possible
that more are being tested in clinical trials as part of standard of care (SOC) inclusion. This means
that these drugs are being tested for their efficacy in tandem with the SOC, which could contain
hydroxychloroquine, or remdesivir, or other compounds, depending on the time and place.

Despite strong synergism and antagonism demonstrated by drug combinations reported in this
study, we would like to emphasize that these results require further validation. Vero E6 cell do not
express the serine proteases TMPRSS2/4, the two proteases crucial for viral entry through the early
membrane fusion pathway of invasion (e.g., nafamostat, camostat, and lysosomotropic agents).88
Thus, all synergistic and antagonistic combinations need to be verified in other cell lines to
determine how penetrant the reported synergies are, for example, in a TMPRSS2/4 expressing cell
line or primary airway cell model. The synergy between amodiaquine and nitazoxanide in Vero
E6 may not translate to Calu-3 (TMPRSS2+) where single-agent amodiaquine is >10-fold less
potent.88 Moreover, the observed synergism/antagonism may not be maintained in vivo due to
complex pharmacokinetics; meanwhile, antagonism sometimes can be circumvented by altering
dosing schedule or formulation. Therefore, more in-depth in vivo validation and pharmacokinetic
modelling are still necessary.

Here, we observed a common antagonism between lysosomotropic amines and remdesivir,
although some drugs (such as umifenovir, mefloquine, and amodiaquine) appeared to synergize
with remdesivir at high concentrations. This synergy at high concentrations may not translate well
to a clinical setting, given (1) lysosomotropic agents have been shown ×10 less potent in

TMPRSS2/4+ cell model;88 (2) it is challenging to maintain a high steady-state plasma
concentration without introducing additional toxicity; and (3) the concentration at which shows
synergy may not be achievable in vivo. For example, 10 µM umifenovir is unlikely achievable in
humans (Cmax = 467 ng/mL, equivalent to 0.98 µM).89

Principally, these findings suggest that lysosomotropic amine drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine,
should be prescribed and used with increased caution in COVID-19 patients due to their relatively
long half-life (usually weeks). This is consistent with a statement issued by the FDA on June 15,
2020, warning that combinations of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine with remdesivir may reduce
the antiviral effectiveness of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2,90 based on an unnamed,
independent, in vitro experiment.

We want to emphasize, that in addition to 73 binary combinations described in this paper, we
also identified in silico 95 ternary combinations of 15 drugs.29 However, experiments if ternary
combinations are more complex, thus, testing those we are considering as a future study.

Conclusions
Using in silico approaches and our expertise in data science, cheminformatics, and computational
antiviral research, we recently identified 281 combinations of 38 drugs with potential activity
against SARS-CoV-2 and prioritized 73 combinations of 32 drugs as potential combination
therapies for COVID-19. Experimental evaluation of these combinations via cytopathic effect and
host cell toxicity counter assays in 6×6 dose matrix allowed us to identify 16 synergistic and 8
antagonistic combinations, with four of them exhibiting both synergy and antagonism.

Despite strong synergism/antagonism observed in some cases here, these are from cell culture
experiments thus requiring more in-depth validation. Among 16 synergistic cases, nitazoxanide
combined with three other compounds (remdesivir, amodiaquine, and umifenovir) exhibited
significant synergy against SARS-CoV-2. Notable synergism was also demonstrated by
combining umifenovir with mefloquine, amodiaquine, emetine, or lopinavir. Nitazoxanide –
remdesivir combo looks the most promising from clinical perspective because both drugs are
approved by FDA (remdesivir through Emergency Use Authorization).
Among eight observed cases of antagonistic interaction, the most notable is the strong antagonism
demonstrated by combination of remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, which is currently
undergoing clinical trials. In four cases, i.e., remdesivir + mefloquine, remdesivir + amodiaquine,
remdesivir + umifenovir, and nitazoxanide + lopinavir, both antagonism and synergism were
observed; the effect was concentration dependent.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate the utility of in silico tools for rational selection of drug
combinations, the importance of preclinical testing of drug combinations prior to their
administration in patients, and the overall promise of using drug repurposing and combination
therapies against SARS-CoV-2.
