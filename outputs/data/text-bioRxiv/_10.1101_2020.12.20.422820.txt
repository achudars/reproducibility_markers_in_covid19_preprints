Abstract
The humoral immune response plays a key role in suppressing the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. The
molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein
to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating
SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By
using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated
inhibition of ACE2–spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in
human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can
be quantitatively described using the binding energies of the binary interactions between the ACE2
receptor and the spike protein, and the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments
represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential
areas of application ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to
identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is not only causing a major public health crisis but also unprecedented economic challenges. One of the features of COVID-19 is the variability of disease outcomes, with a large
majority of patients presenting mild or no symptoms, while others may become severely ill or die1.
Independently of the disease trajectory, the majority of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infections trigger a response of the adaptive immune system2–4. Essential for this immune response are antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (NAbs) by preventing virus binding to the
host-cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)5–13. Effective NAbs target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike proteins and hence inhibit ACE2 binding13. Such antibodies and their
characterization are of great interest either for therapeutic approaches such as plasmapheresis14 or as
structural templates for rational vaccine design15.
Consequently, there is a need for assays that identify the most potent NAbs reliably and efficiently.
The gold standard to detect NAbs is a virus-neutralization test (VNT) on live cells which can either be
performed with live viruses or pseudo-viruses16,17. While these assays are well established, VNTs are
time-consuming and logistically challenging, require several days to obtain results, and necessitate
stringent biosafety measures to be in place for handling the live virus. Furthermore, it is challenging
to standardize VNTs to allow consistency among different laboratories, studies, and patient cohorts18.
This situation has motivated the search for easier to use and faster alternatives to VNTs in the form of
surrogate VNTs (sVNTs). Such assays are typically based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), which provide information on the titers of NAbs in a patient sample19. Neither the standard
VNTs, nor the ELISA-based sVNTs can, however, provide information on whether virus neutralization
is achieved by a high concentration of NAbs with weak binding affinities or a lower concentration of
NAbs with tight binding affinities. This information, however, is of particular importance not just for
understanding the fundamental physicochemical parameters that underlie neutralization but has also
potential applications for selection of suitable donors for plasmapheresis.
Here, we investigate whether NAb efficacy can be predicted based on affinity by assessing the binding
energies that drive ACE2 displacement from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Using microfluidic antibody-affinity
profiling (MAAP), we demonstrate that a ternary equilibrium of ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 (S1), and
antibodies from seropositive, recovered individuals predicts and quantifies the inhibition of ACE2–S1
binding. MAAP is an in-solution assay that determines both the effective dissociation constants (KD)

of polyclonal serum antibodies and their concentrations21,22. Based on these findings, we suggest that
the ratio of the dissociation constants of ACE2–S1 binding and NAb–S1 binding (r = KD,ACE2 / KD,NAb) together with the experimentally determined concentration of NAbs in serum are excellent measures to
predict the inhibitory potential of the polyclonal antibody response. Such quantitative information on
antibody-mediated inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding is crucial to drive decision making in donor selection
for plasmapheresis, lead identification in the development of therapeutic antibodies, and in vaccine
development.

Results and Discussion
Affinity measurements in pre-pandemic control serum using recombinant ACE2, S1, and a
monoclonal neutralizing anti-S1 antibody.
In this study, we investigate whether the affinity of anti-S1 antibodies present in human serum samples is a predictor for their neutralization efficacy. For this purpose, we established a novel assay using
microfluidic diffusional sizing (MDS, Figure 1A) utilizing a recombinant, monoclonal NAb (NAb1) spiked
into SARS-CoV-2 pre-pandemic control serum in the presence of ACE2 and S1. The NAb-mediated inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding is physically determined by the ternary equilibrium ACE2–S1–NAb, which
is described quantitatively by the KD values of the two binary equilibria, ACE2–S1 and NAb–S1 (refer
to Materials and Methods for details). Thus, to validate the data generated on the ternary system, we
determined the KD values of the two underlying binary reactions.

First, we measured the KD of ACE2–S1 binding in the presence of 90% pre-pandemic control serum
(Figure 1B). As the S1 concentration was increased, more of the fluorescently labeled ACE2 was found
in the protein complex and the effective hydrodynamic radius (Rh) increased. Based on a 1:1 equilibrium binding model (Equation 2), the KD of ACE2–S1 was determined to be 7.0 nM (95% CI: 3.5–12.6).
Next, we measured S1 binding to NAb1 in 90% pre-pandemic control serum (Figure 1C). To do so, we
observed the increase in Rh caused by complex formation of fluorescently labeled S1 and NAb1. The
resulting KD of NAb1–S1 was determined to be 5.1 nM (95% CI: 1.7–11.6).

Inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding in pre-pandemic control serum by a monoclonal neutralizing
anti-S1 antibody.
After having characterized the binding between ACE2 and S1 as well as between NAb1 and S1, we
investigated whether NAb1-mediated inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding occurs in the ternary mixture of
ACE2, S1, and NAb1. The addition of NAb1 to a mixture of fluorescently labeled ACE2 at a concentration of 10 nM and S1 at a concentration of 50 nM resulted in a reduction of Rh, as NAb1 bound to
S1, thereby displacing ACE2 from the complex (Figure 1D). At NAb1 concentrations of approximately
1 µM, the effective Rh of the ACE2–S1–NAb1 mixture corresponded to Rh of unbound ACE2, indicating
complete inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding. Quantitatively, NAb1-mediated inhibition is controlled by the
KD values of the two binary interactions, ACE2–S1 and NAb1–S1, as well as by the total concentrations
of the three interaction partners, as outlined in Materials and Methods. For the individual binary reactions, the KD values were KD = 7.0 nM (CI 95%: 3.5–12.6) for ACE2–S1 and KD = 5.1 nM (CI 95%: 1.7–11.6)
for NAb1–S1 (Figures 1B and C). These two affinities enabled us to predict the inhibition isotherm
based on a competition binding model (Equation 11)23. In the ternary mixture used for the competition
experiment ([ACE2]0 = 10 nM, [S1]0 = 50 nM, and 30 pM ≤ [NAb1]0 ≤ 1 µM), 80% of ACE2 is predicted to
be bound to S1 in the absence of NAb1, and [NAb1]0 ≥ 500 nM should completely displace ACE2 from
S1 (Figure 1D, red). The experimental inhibition isotherm was in remarkably good agreement with the
prediction, demonstrating that NAb1 targets the spike RBD and competes with ACE2 for S1 binding,
and that the binary interactions sufficiently describe the ternary inhibition interaction.
For a quantitative analysis of these inhibition data, we fitted globally both the two binary binding isotherms (taken from Figures 1B and C) and the ternary inhibition isotherm (taken from Figure 1D).

Errors for KD are 95% confidence intervals. Error bars represent the standard deviation from triplicate
measurements. D) Inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding by a recombinant, monoclonal NAb (NAb1) in 90%
pre-pandemic control serum measured by MDS. Fluorescently labeled ACE2 at 10 nM and S1 at 50 nM
(predicted 80% of ACE2 bound to S1) were mixed with increasing concentrations of NAb1. NAb1 displaces labeled ACE2 from S1, causing Rh to decrease to the level of unbound ACE2. Red, empty circles
indicate predicted change in Rh in terms of a ternary equilibrium (Equation 11) based on the underlying
KD values of ACE2–S1 and of NAb1–S1. Dotted lines indicate Rh of free ACE2 and ACE2–S1 complex taken from Figure 1B. Error bars represent the standard deviation from triplicate measurements.
The global fit utilizes the KD values of ACE2–S1 and NAb1–S1 as well as Rh of unbound ACE2 as global fit-

ting parameters (Figure 2A). The KD values obtained through the global fit are in agreement with those
extracted from the individual binary fits, demonstrating that NAb1-mediated inhibition is driven by the
binding energies of the competing protein complexes ACE2–S1 and NAb1–S1. Next, we used KD,ACE2 and
KD,NAb1 to calculate equilibrium concentrations of free ACE2, S1, and NAb1 as well as of the complexes
formed by ACE2–S1 and NAb1–S1.

Based on those concentrations, we determined the S1-bound fraction of ACE2 and the NAb1-bound
fraction of S1 to evaluate NAb1 efficacy (Figure 2B).

serum. A) Binary binding of ACE2–S1 (red), binary binding of NAb1–S1 (blue), and the ternary equilibrium of labeled ACE2, S1, and NAb1 (black). For analysis, binding and inhibition isotherms were fitted
globally in terms of Equations 2 and 16, respectively, using KD values of ACE2–S1 and NAb1–S1 as well
as Rh of unbound ACE2 as shared parameters. Errors for KD are 95% confidence intervals. Error bars are
standard deviations of triplicate measurements. B) Speciation curves of the ACE2–S1–NAb1 equilibrium as derived from the global fit, displaying fractions of NAb1-bound S1 (blue) and S1-bound ACE2

An effective NAb will prevent viral spike proteins from binding to ACE2, which is key to prevent host-cell
infection. In vivo, this is accomplished through a combination of NAb–S1 affinity and NAb concentration, as the other parameters that govern the equilibrium, such as ACE2–S1 affinity and the concentrations of ACE2 and S1, cannot be influenced by the host. Thus, the most effective NAbs will have KD

values considerably lower than the KD of ACE2–S1 and concentrations considerably higher than their KD
for S1 binding. This condition is directly described by the ratio r = KD,ACE2 / KD,NAb , which is provided by our
assay. For example, at r = 10, the concentration of NAb could be ten times lower than the concentration
of ACE2 to still bind the same amount of S1.

Microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling and neutralization potency in serum of SARS-CoV-2
seropositive individuals
After establishing the assay using a recombinant, monoclonal NAb, we applied the same approach to
the quantification of the potency of polyclonal anti-S1 antibody responses in COVID-19 patient samples. To do so, we analyzed blood serum of two individuals who had tested seropositive for anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG and IgM. Sample 1 was obtained from a 52-year old white female with mild COVID-19 symptoms, while sample 2 was derived from a 44-year old asymptomatic white male.
To determine the KD of anti-S1 antibody–S1 binding, we mixed fluorescently labeled S1 at a constant
concentration with patient serum at various dilutions and determined Rh as an indicator of complex
formation (Figures 3A and C). Since the anti-S1 antibody concentration in the two patient sera was
unknown, we extracted this information from the equilibrium binding isotherms by using the concentration of antibody-binding sites as a fitting parameter21,22. To obtain well-constrained binding-site concentrations, we measured antibody-binding isotherms at three different concentrations of fluorescently labeled S1. To also assess the neutralization potential of the anti-S1 antibodies in the patient sera,
we obtained inhibition isotherms from ternary mixtures of fluorescently labeled ACE2, S1 and patient
serum at various concentrations (Figures 3B and D). Both seropositive samples inhibited binding of
ACE2 to S1. While sample 1 reached complete inhibition at a serum concentration of 90%, ACE2 was
not completely displaced from S1 in sample 2, which could either be due to weak-affinity antibodies or
a too low concentration of antibodies.
For each serum sample, we generated three binary binding isotherms and one inhibition isotherm
which we used as a combined set of data to extract KD values of antibody–S1 binding, concentrations

of antibody-binding sites and neutralization potency. As demonstrated with NAb1 (Figure 2A), we globally fitted binary antibody–S1 (Equation 2) and ternary antibody-mediated inhibition (Equation 16)
using the KD of antibody–S1 binding as a shared parameter across all sets of data. The KD value of
ACE2–S1 binding in human serum (7.0 nM) was used as a constant in the fit, based on the data shown
in Figure 1B. In both patients, global analysis of binding and inhibition resulted in KD values in the
sub-nanomolar range, which is in line with the values obtained by fitting the binding isotherms without
the inhibition isotherm (Table S1 and Figure S1). A MAAP study on a larger number of patient samples
showed a similar range of affinities among anti-spike serum antibodies21. To investigate the robustness
of the KD values derived by the global fits, we also analyzed the data using Bayesian inference21,22. While
the agreement of Bayesian inference with the global fits was excellent, in both patient samples the
posterior probability for the KD distribution provided strong constraints for the upper bound but weak
constraints for the lower bound, thus providing an upper limit on the KD value and indicating a tight
binding interaction. The best-fit values from the global fits converged to this upper limit representing
the higher end of KD values that describe the data. For sample 2, the antibody-binding affinity was tighter than for sample 1. The concentration of antibody-binding sites was 110 nM (CI 95%: 90–130) and
19 nM (CI 95%: 17–23) for sample 1 and sample 2, respectively, values which are within the concentration range observed in an earlier MAAP study of a larger number of samples21. In both serum samples,
the KD values of antibody–S1 binding were considerably lower than the concentration of antibody-binding sites, a condition which is required for effective antibody binding.

Moreover, in both samples the ratio r = KD,ACE2 / KD,NAb is 10 or higher, indicating that both individuals produced antibodies against S1 with good neutralization potential. The global fit describes the inhibition
isotherms (Figures 3B and D) of both patient sera remarkably well, demonstrating that antibody-mediated inhibition of the ACE2–S1 interaction is driven by serum-antibody affinity. Furthermore, this
indicates that most of the anti-S1 antibodies raised by these two individuals target the RBD of S1 and
compete with ACE2 binding as antibodies binding to other epitopes would result in data that deviate
from the combined analysis of binary and ternary equilibria used here.

Conclusions
In this study, we have used microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling to measure independently the binding affinities of the two molecular interactions involved in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, namely
that between ACE2–spike and spike–NAb. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the knowledge of
these two interaction energies enables the quantitative description of the ability of patient antibodies
to inhibit the binding of the viral spike protein to the host cell ACE2 receptor. The knowledge of both
affinity and concentration of anti-S1 antibodies provides valuable information that has the potential to
support decision making in research as well as clinical practice. For example, in convalescent plasma
therapy a donor with high-affinity, high-concentration anti-RBD antibodies would be most suitable as
donor antibodies are diluted c.a. by a factor of ten during the procedure. Specifically, based on this
analysis, sample 1 containing high-affinity antibodies at a concentration of 110 nM should be preferred
for plasmapheresis over sample 2 which also contains high-affinity antibodies but at a significantly
lower concentration of 19 nM. Furthermore, for the selection of autoantibodies as therapeutic candidates it is crucial to be able to deconvolute antibody titers into the component fundamental quantities
of affinity and concentration. Indeed, a given antibody titer, as measured for example by conventional
ELISA, could arise due to a low concentration of very tightly binding antibodies, which would be attractive candidates for further developments, or by contrast from a high concentration of weakly binding
antibodies which are less interesting as leads for further optimization for therapeutic use. Finally, the
ability to measure concentration and affinity provides an added level of granularity in understanding
the diverse immune responses characteristic of COVID-19 infections and has the potential to evaluate
and understand the potency of vaccines, which in order to be optimally effective must generate immune responses that lead to high-affinity virus-neutralizing antibodies at high concentrations.

Materials and Methods
Fluorescent labeling of proteins
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 (S1N-C52H4, ACROBiosystems) and the extracellular domain of ACE2 (AC2-H52H8,
ACROBiosystems) were each reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 (P4417, Merck)
at a concentration of 0.6 mg/mL according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For labelling, the pH of
50 µg of protein solution was adjusted to pH 8.3 using 1 M NaHCO3 followed by addition of Alexa Fluor™
647 NHS ester at a molar dye-to-protein ratio of 3:1. Samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight, and
free dye was removed by size-exclusion chromatography on an ÄKTA pure system (Cytiva) equipped
with a Superdex 200 Increase 3.2/300 column (Cytiva) using PBS at pH 7.4 as a buffer. Labeled and
purified proteins were stored at −80 °C in PBS pH 7.4 containing 10% (w/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant.
Affinity measurements of binary equilibrium by microfluidic diffusional sizing
To determine the affinity of ACE2–SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 binding, Alexa Fluor™ 647 labeled ACE2 (10 nM)
was mixed with unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 at increasing concentrations (100 pM–3.2 µM) in the
presence of 90% heat-inactivated human serum (H5667, Merck) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. To

concentrations (3.8 pM–250 nM) in the presence of 90% heat-inactivated human serum (H5667, Merck) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. To measure complex formation by microfluidic diffusional sizing,
5 µL of sample were pipetted on a microfluidic chip and analysis was performed at the 1.5 nm–8.0 nm
setting on a Fluidity One-W Serum (Fluidic Analytics). Serum autofluorescence was determined in the
absence of labeled protein and used to correct MDS data measured of binding interactions. Error bars
shown in figures are standard deviations from triplicate measurements. The equilibrium dissociation
constant (KD) was determined by nonlinear least-squares (NLSQ) fitting (Prism, GraphPad Software) in
terms of the following binary equilibrium:

Measurement of ternary equilibrium (recombinant proteins) by microfluidic diffusional sizing
To assess inhibition of ACE2–S1 binding by a recombinant NAb, a mixture of Alexa Fluor™ 647 labeled
ACE2 and unlabeled S1 at concentrations of 10 nM and 50 nM, respectively, was equilibrated with increasing concentrations of NAb (30 pM–1.0 µM) in the presence of 90% heat-inactivated human serum
(H5667, Merck) at a temperature of 4 °C overnight. MDS data was obtained as described above.

Equation 16 describes the equilibrium concentration of unbound S1 using the total concentrations of
the individual components, two KD values, and n.
Global analysis of binary and ternary binding experiments
To extract equilibrium concentrations and corresponding bound fractions of ACE2 and S1 in the ternary
mixture with NAb, we globally fitted (NLSQ) binary (ACE2–S1 and S1–NAb) and ternary (ACE2–S1–NAb)
experiments. The binary experiments were fitted in terms of Equation 2, while the ternary experiment
was fitted in terms of Equations 13–17. KD,ACE2, KD,NAb, and Rh,freeACE2 were set to be global fitting parameters, while all other parameters were fitted locally. The stoichiometry n was set to 1 as concentrations
refer to binding sites.

Origin of serum samples.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive human serum samples (convalescent) were obtained from BioIVT. BioIVT
sought informed consent from each subject, or the subjects legally authorized representative and appropriately documented this in writing. All samples are collected under IRB-approved protocols.

Microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling of serum antibodies (MAAP).
MAAP was used to determine concentration of antibody-binding sites, [Ab], and KD of antibodies in serum samples of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. To do so, fluorescently labeled SARS-CoV-2 spike
S1 was mixed at constant concentrations of 10 nM, 40 nM, and 100 nM with serum at increasing concentrations (1%–90%) to generate three equilibrium binding isotherms per serum sample. MDS data
was obtained as described above, the only difference being that samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C
before measurement. Autofluorescence of serum samples was determined in the absence of labeled
protein and used to correct MDS data measured of binding interactions. To determine the concentration of antibody binding sites and KD, global NLSQ fitting in terms of Equation 2 was used, having Rh,free,
Rh,complex, [U]0 = [Ab] and KD as global fit parameters.
Measurement of ACE2–S1 binding inhibition by serum antibodies using microfluidic sizing
For sample 1, Alexa Fluor™ 647 labeled ACE2 and unlabeled S1 at concentrations of 10 nM and 30 nM,
respectively, were mixed with increasing concentrations of serum and incubated at 4 °C for 1 hour. For
sample 2, Alexa Fluor™ 647 labeled ACE2 and unlabeled S1 at concentrations of 5 nM and 20 nM, respectively, were mixed with increasing concentrations of serum and incubated at 4 °C for 1 hour. MDS
data was obtained as described above.
