Abstract

27

Coronaviruses constitute a global threat to human population since three highly pathogenic

28

coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) have crossed species to cause

29

severe human respiratory disease. Considering the worldwide emergency status due to the

30

current COVID-19 pandemic, effective pan-coronavirus antiviral drugs are required to tackle

31

the ongoing as well as future (re)emerging virus outbreaks. Protein kinase CK2 has been

32

deemed a promising therapeutic target in COVID-19 supported by its in vitro pharmacologic

33

inhibition and molecular studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. CIGB-325 is a first-in-class

34

synthetic peptide impairing the CK2-mediated signaling whose safety and clinical benefit have

35

been evidenced in Covid-19 and cancer patients after intravenous administration. Here, we

36

explored the putative antiviral effect of CIGB-325 over MDBK cells infected by bovine

37

coronavirus (BCoV) Mebus. Importantly, CIGB-325 inhibited both the cytopathic effect and

38

the number of plaques forming units with a half-inhibitory concentrations IC50 = 3.5 µM and

39

17.7 µM, respectively. Accordingly, viral protein accumulation at the cytoplasm was clearly

40

reduced by treating BCoV-infected cells with CIGB-325 over time, as determined by

41

immunocytochemistry. Of note, data from pull-down assay followed by western blot and/or

42

mass spectrometry identification revealed physical interaction of CIGB-325 with nucleocapsid

43

(N) protein and a bona fide cellular CK2 substrates. Functional enrichment and network

44

analysis from the CIGB-325 interacting proteins indicated cytoskeleton reorganization and

45

protein folding as the most represented biological processes disturbed by this anti-CK2 peptide.

46

Altogether, our findings not only unveil the direct antiviral activity of CIGB-325 on

47

coronavirus infection but also provide molecular clues underlying such effect. Also, our data

48

reinforce the scientific rationality behind the pharmacologic inhibition of CK2 to treat

49

coronavirus infections.

1. Introduction

51

Coronaviruses (CoVs) comprise a diverse group of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses in

52

the family Coronaviridae that infects a wide variety of hosts, including mammals and birds,

53

and cause several respiratory and enteric diseases [1, 2]. These viruses comprise infectious

54

bronchitis virus (IBV) in chickens, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible

55

gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), swine acute diarrhea syndrome-CoV (SADS-CoV), bovine

56

coronavirus (BCoV) as many others [3]. Four coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43,

57

HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63) are continuously circulating in the human population, causing

58

common cold. However, three highly pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and

59

SARS-CoV-2) have crossed species to cause severe human respiratory disease [3]. In 2002, a

60

human pathogenic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) caused more than

61

8000 human infections in 2002–2003, with a case fatality of ~10% [4]. A decade later, a novel

62

lethal zoonotic disease appeared in the Arabian Peninsula caused by the Middle East respiratory

63

syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with a 36.1% mortality rate according to the World

64

Health Organization (WHO) [5]. Finally, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 emerged from

65

Wuhan, China in December 2019 and three months after became a pandemic disease with more

66

than 150 million people infected and three million deaths across the world, therefore collapsing

67

national

68

(www.worldometers.info/coronavirus, accessed June 6, 2021).

69

In this context, vaccination represents a reasonable strategy to prevent or avoid coronavirus

70

infection, however, vaccines fail, in part, due to virus resistance emergency [6]. The frequency

71

and extension of the abovementioned epidemiological events highlight the urgent necessity of

72

therapeutics solutions to treat viral infection. Taking into consideration the unprecedented

73

outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in a scenery with no established active molecules against

74

Betacoronavirus, the availability of effective pan-coronavirus antiviral drugs is required to

75

tackle (re)emerging virus outbreaks. Considering the need of a prompt drug development, re-

76

purposing of established drug with other therapeutics uses allow a fastest way to conduct the

77

proof-of-concept in the clinic [7, 8].

78

Traditional antiviral strategies directed to viral targets often yield drug resistance; therefore,

79

targeting relevant host factors involved in viral replication guarantee therapeutics with a wide-

80

spectrum activity since families of viruses share common cellular signaling pathways and

81

processes [9, 10]. Within host factors that viruses hijack during the infection process, kinases

82

proteins play a fundamental role phosphorylating viral and host substrates [11].

83

Phosphorylation landscape during the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle revealed changes in the activity

84

of 97 out of 518 human kinases [12]. Remarkably, protein kinase CK2 was found dramatically

85

upregulated with a clear increase in phosphorylation of well-characterized substrates involved

86

in the cytoskeleton organization mainly on the filopodia protrusions that promote virus egress

87

and rapid cell-to-cell spread [12]. Consistently, an in vitro strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

88

was achieved with the CK2 specific inhibitor CX-4945 supporting the relevance of this kinase

89

during the viral cycle [12].

90

CIGB-325 (formerly CIGB-300) is a synthetic peptide designed to target a subset of CK2

91

substrates by binding to the conserved phosphoacceptor sites and recently it has shown a direct

92

impact over the CK2 enzymatic activity as classical inhibitors [13-15]. This biochemical

93

feature supports the first-in-class attributes of CIGB-325 and entails important

94

pharmacological differences compared with other available CK2 inhibitors. Clinical data have

95

confirmed that CIGB-325 peptide is safe and well-tolerated when administered by intravenous

96

infusion, whereas showed clinical efficacy in cancer patients [16, 17]. Of note, CIGB-325 has

97

shown preliminary evidences of antiviral activity in different in vitro models. For instance,

98

anti-HIV activity was reported as the peptide interferes with a putative NPM1-Rev interaction

99

in cells and subsequently downregulates Rev-dependent gene expression [18]. Recently, a

100

Phase I/II clinical trial with CIGB-325 showed benefits in Covid-19 patients with pneumonia

101

with significant reduction of the pulmonary lesions and quick improvement of the clinical

102

status at day 7 [19].

103

Some many aspects of disease caused by highly pathogenic human CoV can be recapitulated

104

in animal CoV diseases. Therefore, animal coronavirus models are suitable and alternative

105

systems for testing putative pan-coronavirus therapies [20]. Moreover, it appears as an

106

advantage of such models the fact that does not require restrictive BSL-3 facilities. In this work

107

we aimed to explore the antiviral activity of the anti-CK2 peptidic inhibitor CIGB-325 against

108

coronavirus infection, using a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) model which belongs to the

109

Betacoronavirus genus that includes murine hepatitis coronaviruses (MHV), porcine

110

hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), rat coronavirus (RtCoV), human respiratory

111

coronavirus HCoV-OC43 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2)

112

[21]. BCoV causes enteric and respiratory disease in cattle, and is zoonotically transmissible

113

among species, since BCoV-like viruses have been detected in wild ruminants and humans

114

[22]. BCoV shares biological pathogenic and pneumoenteric properties with species of

115

Coronavirus related to SARS-CoVs [23]. Thus, despite BCoV use a different cellular receptor

116

to enter into the cells, replication, assembly and final egress of viral particles may share

117

common viral and cellular factors [24, 25].

118

In this work, we tested for the first time the putative antiviral activity of CIGB-325 in

119

Coronavirus infection in vitro using MDBK cells infected by BCoV. Besides, we unveil

120

mechanistic clues supporting the antiviral activity. Our data also reinforce the rationale for

121

pharmacologic inhibition of CK2 to treat diseases originated by these types of viruses.

2. Materials and Methods

123

2.1. Cell culture and BCoV Virus

124

Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney cell line (MDBK) (ATCC® CCL-22™) was maintained in

125

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, USA), supplemented with 10%

126

inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen, CA, USA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The BCoV

127

(strain Mebus) was obtained from the Pasteur Institute in São Paulo, Brazil, and titrated in

128

serial 1 log dilutions (from 1 log to 11 log) to obtain a 50% tissue culture infective dose

129

(TCID50) on 96-well culture plates of MDBK cells. The plates were observed daily during 4

130

days for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) using an inverted optical microscope. The

131

viral titer was calculated according to the Reed & Muench method based on eight replicates

132

for titration.

133

2.2. Cell Cytotoxicity Assay and Drug Treatments

134

Cell cytotoxicity was determined using crystal violet staining. Briefly, 60 000 MDBK cells

135

were seeded in flat-bottom 96-wells plates per well in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine

136

serum (FBS), and a curve of serial dilutions (1:2) of CIGB-325 (3.12-200 μM) were added by

137

triplicate. After 4 days, crystal violet stain was conducted as described in 2.4. The half-

138

cytotoxic concentration CC50 was estimated from the fitted dose-response curves using the

139

CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom).

140

2.3. Cytopathic Effect Assay

141

To evaluate the antiviral effect against BCoV, 260 000 MDBK cells were seeded in 24-well

142

cell culture plates per well and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After incubation,

143

selected concentrations of CIGB-325, CX-4945, or F20-2 negative control peptide were added

144

to cell monolayers for 1 h in serum-free DMEM. Interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) at 500 IU/

145

mL was employed in this study as a positive control. Subsequently, 14 000 TCID50 of virus in

146

200 µL were added to each well of the plate. After 1h of incubation, the final volume was

147

completed up to 1 ml and the appropriate drug concentration was maintained. Incubation was

148

prolonged for 4 days at 37° C in 5% CO2 and the CPE was finally revealed by crystal violet

149

staining. The antiviral activity rate was expressed as the drug concentration that protects 50%

150

of CPE. The half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were estimated from the fitted dose-

151

response curves using the CalcuSyn software (Biooft, Cambridge, United Kingdom).

152

2.4. Crystal Violet Assay

153

The crystal violet staining was used to evaluate cytotoxicity of CIGB-325 and verify viral

154

cytopathic effect perceived by visual observation. After the incubation period, medium was

155

removed from each well, crystal violet (1%) (Sigma, MO, USA) was added and incubated for

156

5 min at room temperature. After dye removal, wells were washed with water. Finally,

157

absorbance at 578 nm was read using a CLARIOstar® high-performance monochromator

158

multimode microplate reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany).

159

2.5. Plaque Reduction Assay

160

Viral titers in supernatants of drug-untreated and treated cells were evaluated using a plaque

161

reduction assay. Briefly, MDBK cells were seeded at 260 000 cells per well in 24-well cell

162

culture plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Subsequently, 200 μL of

163

supernatants in 10-fold serial dilution was added to the MDBK monolayers. After 1 h of

164

incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2, the viral inoculum was aspirated, and 0.5 mL of

165

carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma, MO, USA) overlay with DMEM and supplemented with 2%

166

FBS, was added to each well. After 4 days of incubation, the cells were fixed and stained with

167

Naphtol Blue Black (0.1%) (Sigma, MO, USA MO, USA). Finally, plaques were counted

168

visually and the virus titer as plaque-forming units (PFU) per mL was calculated.

169

2.6. Quantitative PCR Assay

170

MDBK cells were plated on 24-well cell culture plates at 260 000 cells per well and incubated

171

overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Once cell monolayers were established, CIGB-325 (15 µM,

172

30 μM), F20.2 (30 μM), CX-4945 (1.25 μM) or vehicle (PBS) were added for 1 h in serum-

173

free DMEM. Subsequently, 14 000 TCID50 of virus in 200 µL were added to each well. After

174

1h of incubation, final volume was completed up to 1 ml and the appropriate drug’s

175

concentration was maintained for 24 h. Three replicates per condition were used. After

176

incubation time, the culture medium was withdrawn and the cells were washed with PBS and

177

suspended in 350 µL of Lysis Buffer (with 1% of β-mercaptoethanol, Sigma, MO, USA) for

178

RNA isolation (AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit, Qiagen, USA) according to the

179

manufacturer protocol. All RNA samples were checked by Nanodrop spectrophotometer to

180

measure concentration (ng/µL) and OD relation (260/280 nm). Quality control parameters were

181

fulfilled by all the samples (100% OD 260/280 nm between 1.7 and 2.2). Complementary

182

(c)DNAs were obtained from 500 ng of total RNAs, using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA

183

Synthesis Kit package (Roche, Germany) following manufacturer instructions. The qPCR

184

reactions were set up in 20 µL using LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master 2x (Roche,

185

Germany), 300 nM of oligonucleotides and 1:10 dilutions of each cDNA with three replicates

186

per sample. We amplified two genes for normalization gapdh (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

187

dehydrogenase) and hmbs (Hydroxymethyl-bilane synthase) and the transcript encoding for N

188

protein from BCoV. In parallel, we used a plasmid with the BCoV N protein transcript cloned

189

that it was amplified from serial dilutions as a standard curve. This standard curve was used

190

for N copy number calculations. All the oligonucleotides were synthetized in the Synthesis

191

Department at CIGB (Table S1). Runs were carried out in the LightCycler®480II equipment

192

(Roche, Germany) in a 96-well format and SYBR Green Probe II mode with a standard

193

program with 45 cycles. Fold changes of N transcript expression with each treatment were

194

calculated corcenning to the Virus control using REST 2009 program (v2.0.13, Qiagen, GbmH)

195

[26], after normalization with gapdh and hmbs genes. using Ct values and reaction efficiencies

196

per amplicon calculated in LinReg 2009 (v 11.3) [27]. Statistical differences were reported in

197

this program with a p value associated significant for p < 0.05 [28]. Additionally, we also report

198

a copy number of N transcript by extrapolation of Ct values into the regression formula from

199

the standard curve (N-BCoV encoding plasmid copy number vs Ct).

200

2.7. BCoV Viral Proteins Detection by Western Blot

201

MDBK cells were plated on 24-well cell culture plates at 260 000 cells per well and incubated

202

overnight at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. Once cell monolayers were established, CIGB-325 (30 μM)

203

or vehicle (PBS) were added for 1h in serum-free DMEM. Subsequently, 14000 TCID50 of

204

virus in 200 µL were added to each well of the plate. After 1h of incubation, final volume was

205

completed up to 1 ml and the appropriate drug’s concentration was maintained for 24 h. After

206

incubation, the culture medium was withdrawn and the cells were washed with PBS and lysed

207

in RIPA buffer containing protease/phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA,

208

USA). Equal amounts of protein (30 µg/sample) were resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins

209

were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with human polyclonal

210

IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 generated by CGIB and validated by ELISA and western blot.

211

Detection was performed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG 1:100 (Jackson

212

ImmunoResearch, USA) and signal was developed using SuperSignal West Pico

213

Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).

214

2.8. BCoV Viral Proteins Detection by Immunocytochemistry

215

MDBK cells were plated on eight well glass slide and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5%

216

CO2. After incubation, cells were pre-treated for 1 h with CIGB-325 (30 μM) or vehicle (PBS)

217

and infected with 100 µL of virus at a concentration of 70 000 TCID50/well. After 1h of

218

incubation, final volume was completed up to 500 µL and the appropriate drug’s concentration

219

was maintained for 16 h and 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed with cold PBS three

220

times and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at 4 °C. After permeabilization with 0.5%

221

Triton X-100 for 10 min, cells were blocked by incubation with 4% bovine serum albumin

222

(Sigma, MO,USA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed again, and incubated with

223

30 μg/mL human polyclonal anti- SARS-CoV-2 (CIGB, Cuba) for 2 h at room temperature.

224

Then, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody 1:100 (Sigma, MO, USA) was

225

incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed 3 times with PBS. Finally, AEC substrate

226

(Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) was added and coverglass was mounted using 40%

227

glycerol mounting medium and analyzed using a BX43 upright microscope (Olympus, USA).

228

2.9. Pull-down Assay

229

CIGB-325 interacting proteins were identified by in vitro pull-down followed by tandem mass

230

spectrometric analysis (LC-MS/MS). MDBK cells were seeded at 3600000 cells in 60 mm

231

dishes and infected with 500 µL of virus at 70,000 TCID50/dish. After 48 h post-infection,

232

cells were collected, washed and lysed in hypotonic PBS solution (1×) (Sigma, MO, USA)

233

containing 1 mM DTT (Sigma, MO, USA), TritonX-100 (1%) and complete protease inhibitor

234

(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Cellular lysates were cleared by centrifugation and 300 µg of total

235

protein were incubated with biotin-tagged CIGB-325 (100 μM) or medium alone for 30 min at

236

room temperature and added to 30 µL of pre-equilibrated streptavidin-sepharose matrix (GE

237

Healthcare, IL, USA). Following 1 h at 4 °C, the matrix was collected by centrifugation and

238

extensively

239

interacting proteins were eluted, resolved in an SDS-PAGE gel and processed as described

240

later. For in vivo pull-down assays, BCoV-Mebus infected and uninfected MDBK cells were

241

treated with biotin-tagged CIGB-325 (100 μM) or medium alone for 30 min at 37° C in 5%

242

CO2. Subsequently, cells were collected and pull-down assay was conducted as above

243

mentioned. Proteins bound to streptavidin-sepharose were eluted, resolved in a 12 % SDS-

244

PAGE gel, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. For western blot analysis, a human

245

polyclonal IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 (CIGB, Cuba) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against

246

CK2α (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were used as primary antibodies. Detection was

247

performed with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG 1:5000 (Sigma, MO, USA) and anti-

248

human IgG 1:100 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA). In parallel, untreated cells were subjected

257

to a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration tandem mass spectrometer QTof-2 (Water, MA,

acquisition and processing. Protein identification based on MS/MS spectra was made against

260

the Swiss-Prot database by using Mascot database search engine (version 2.5). False discovery

262

the CIGB-325 treated sample were considered as CIGB325 interacting proteins. Protein-

263

3. Results

302

3.1 CIGB-325 Exhibits Antiviral Effect on Bovine Coronavirus Infected Cells

303

To test the in vitro CIGB-325 effect, we analyzed the CPE of BCoV-Mebus using a cell-based

304

assay. MDBK cells appeared as rounded and multinucleated cells within 48 h; beyond 72 h of

305

incubation a strong cell monolayer damage was observed. CIGB-325 elicited a very potent

306

inhibition of the virus CPE with an IC50=3.5 μM just some significant cytotoxicity emerges at

307

higher concentrations (CC50=150 μM) (Figure 1A), hence indicating a selectivity index

308

(SI=42). Specificity of the CIGB-325 antiviral effect was corroborated using the F20-2 peptide

309

which contains the same cell-penetrating peptide as CIGB-325 but lacks the CK2 inhibitory

310

domain [13]. Interestingly, testing of another small molecule inhibiting CK2 activity (CX-

311

4945), also reduced significantly the BCoV-Mebus CPE as well as IFN alpha-2b, which was

312

used as an antiviral drug reference (Figure 1B).

313

To corroborate the CIGB-325 inhibitory effects over BCoV-Mebus infection, we additionally

314

measured the viral load on cell supernatants collected from CPE experiments by performing a

315

plaque assay. CIGB-325 displayed dose-dependent inhibition of viral titers CIGB-325

316

according to the number of BCoV-Mebus PFU (Figure 1C). Of note, the CIGB-325 antiviral

317

effect was achieved even 16 and 26 h post-viral challenge indicating a possible impact on the

318

late stages of the BCoV-Mebus life cycle (Figure S1).

319

3.2 CIGB-325 Impacts the BCoV-Mebus Viral Machinery in MDBK Cells

320

To assess the putative effect of CIGB-325 over viral mRNA expression we conducted

321

quantitative real-time PCR on BCoV-Mebus infected cells. Data from Figure 2A indicates that

322

CIGB-325 significantly downregulated the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein copy number after

323

24 h of incubation in a dose-dependent manner while F20-2 slightly. Likewise, CX-4945

324

treatment affected the nucleocapsid gene expression, thus confirming a direct involvement of

325

the CK2-mediated phosphorylation into coronavirus gene expression.

326

Aside from viral mRNA levels, we also investigated the effect of CIGB-325 over viral protein

327

synthesis. Western blot experiments were conducted using a human anti-SARS-CoV-2

328

polyclonal antibody from one COVID-19 convalescent patient. Of note, BCoV-Mebus M and

329

N proteins were the most efficiently recognized by the human polyclonal antibody, exhibiting

330

molecular weights of 49 and 26 kDa, respectively.

331

CIGB-325 treatment dramatically downregulated the viral M-protein expression at 24 h post-

332

BCoV-Mebus infection, although the N protein levels were also affected to a lesser extent

333

(Figure 2B). Immunocytochemistry data revealed that CIGB-325 treatment notably cleared the

334

intracellular accumulation of both viral proteins at 24 h post-infection (Figure 2C). Likewise,

335

as early as 16 h, CIGB-325 treatment also downregulated the intracellular viral proteins

336

(Figure S2).

337

Considering that CIGB-325 exerts anti-CK2 activity by direct binding to CK2 conserved

338

phosphoacceptor domain on substrates [13], we searched for such aminoacidic motifs on viral

339

proteins to anticipate putative physical interactions. As we confirmed that BCoV-Mebus viral

340

N protein displays such a sequence [33], we conducted in vitro pull-down experiments using

341

biotinylated CIGB-325 to capture interacting proteins from infected-cell lysates with further

342

binding to a streptavidin-sepharose matrix. Interestingly, western blot data from pull-down

343

fractions using a human anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody showed that pull-down

344

fractions but not the input, displayed a unique band corresponding to BCoV-Mebus N protein

345

(49 kDa) (Figure 3A). Furthermore, in vivo pull-down assays were performed on BCoV-

346

Mebus infected MDBK cells to confirm the interaction of CIGB-325 with viral N protein on a

347

relevant cellular context. Of note, a clear band corresponding to the N protein (49 kDa) was

348

again observed after western blot analysis (Figure 3A). To verify the in situ physical proximity

349

between CIGB-325 and N protein at the subcellular compartments, we next employed confocal

350

microscopy on infected MDBK cells treated with CIGB-325-F. After 30 min of incubation, a

351

quite clear orange co-localization pattern of CIGB-325 with the viral N protein was observed

352

mainly throughout the cytoplasm, with a slighter extent within the nucleus of the cell (Figure

353

3B).

354

Previous findings have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 N protein directly interacts with protein

355

kinase CK2 [34]. To corroborate such interaction in our in vitro BCoV-Mebus infection model,

356

we conducted immunoprecipitation assays from infected MDBK cell lysates using a

357

commercial anti-CK2 antibody and subsequent western blot with a rabbit polyclonal antibody

358

against the viral N protein. Similarly, data revealed that CK2 also associates physically to the

359

BCoV-Mebus N protein in this cellular context (Figure S3).

360

3.3 CIGB-325 Interactomic Landscape on BCoV-Mebus Infected MDBK Cells

361

To identify the full array of viral and host proteins which interact with CIGB-325 in BCoV-

362

Mebus infected MDBK cells, we conducted in vitro pull-down experiments coupled to LC-

363

MS/MS analysis. Lysates from MDKB treated or not with biotinylated CIGB-325 were

364

separated by SDS-PAGE. After tryptic digestion, the resulting peptides were isotopically

365

labeled, pooled together and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Using this experimental approach, we

366

identified 50 host proteins and 2 viral proteins that interact with CIGB-325 in infected MDBK

367

cells. Viral proteins corresponded to N protein and Non-structural protein 2a (NSp2a).

368

Members of the family of proteins including actin, tubulin, myosin, heat shock protein 70

369

(HSP70), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-

370

monooxygenase activation protein as well as others showed in Table S2 were identified as host

371

CIGB-325 interacting proteins. In agreement with CIGB-325 interactome from tumor cells [14,

372

35], nucleolar protein B23/NPM1 was also identified in our study.

373

To envisage the putative biological processes that might be perturbed by CK2 targeting,

374

enrichment analysis of the CIGB-325 interacting host proteins was performed. Of note, protein

375

folding and the response to unfolded protein, cytoskeleton organization and cell cycle were

376

significantly represented above all biological processes in the interactomic profile (Figure S4).

377

Furthermore, we searched for bona fide CK2 substrates among the CIGB-325 interacting

378

proteins according to Meggio and Pinna dataset [31], the list of high confidence CK2 substrates

379

reported by Bian et al. [32] and the PhosphoSitePlus database (www.phosphosite.org, accesed

380

June 6, 2021). Remarkably, CIGB-325 interacted with 15 proteins previously described as CK2

381

substrates in MDBK cells (Table S2). To better understand the global putative connection

382

among the CIGB-325 interactome on infected MDBK cells, we constructed a protein-protein

383

interaction (PPI) network with the identified proteins using information annotated in STRING

384

database (Figure 4A). In PPI network, we detected two functional physiological complexes

385

corresponding to proteins involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and protein folding,

386

consistently with the most represented biological processes.

387

Previous reports from our group have indicated that CIGB-325 also impairs CK2 signaling by

388

direct binding to CK2 catalytic subunit in tumor cells [14, 15]. Therefore, we finally move

389

forward to determine if this direct peptide-enzyme interaction could also take place within the

390

context of a viral infection induced by BCoV-Mebus in MDBK cells. Using in vivo pull-down

391

with biotinylated-CIGB-325 followed by western blot with a commercial anti-CK2

392

monoclonal antibody, it was possible to demonstrate the presence of CK2 in the pull-down

393

fraction (Figure 4B). To corroborate whether this interaction could impact any of the CK2-

394

mediated signaling pathways, we also evaluated the effect of CIGB-325 over the PI3K/Akt

395

pathway by measuring the downstream phosphorylation of the RPS6 protein, as biomarker of

396

the PI3K/Akt pathway activation which in turns, represents one of the CK2 mediated signaling

397

pathways. Importantly, CIGB-325 treatment during 45 min clearly impaired the RPS6

398

phosphorylation (i.e.; at residues S235/236) at 24 h post-BCoV infection on MDBK cells

399

(Figure 4C). However, a significant increase in RPS6 phosphorylation was observed upon

400

BCoV-Mebus infection in these cells which reinforces the relevance of this pathway for the

401

viral replication processes in the coronavirus biology [36, 37].

4. Discussion

403

During the last 20 years, three zoonotic CoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

404

have evidenced that novel highly pathogenic coronavirus could spread into human populations

405

[38]. Therefore, the development of an eﬀective antiviral drug against already-known and new

406

coronaviruses that may emerge from animal reservoir hosts constitutes an urgent necessity.

407

Host-directed drugs represent a therapeutic strategy with broad-spectrum activity since viruses

408

commonly hijack cellular factors and signaling pathways for their own replication [9, 39].

409

Among the host proteins relevant on some steps of the viral life cycle, protein kinase CK2 has

410

been recently suggested as a fundamental factor in the SARS-CoV-2 infection [12]. Several

411

evidences have shown an up-regulation of this protein during the viral replication along with a

412

relevant molecular interaction with SARS-CoV-2 N protein at the ﬁlopodia protrusions. In fact,

413

the specific CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 has displayed in vitro antiviral activity against SARS-

414

CoV-2 infection [12]. Of note, the CK2-N protein interaction is conserved among the three

415

coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) [10], therefore the scientiﬁc

416

rationality of using CK2 inhibitor on pan-coronavirus infection could provide clinical beneﬁt

417

for future outbreaks.

418

CIGB-325 is a peptide-based drug capable to inhibit the CK2-mediated phosphorylation on the

419

substrates, from clinic evidences previously assessed in cancer patients, this anti-CK2 peptide

420

is safe and well-tolerated [16, 17, 19]. To investigate the putative therapeutic use of CIGB-325

421

in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, a Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted [19]. Consistent

422

with the instrumental role of CK2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, CIGB-325 treatment showed

423

clinical benefit as evidenced by a significant reduction of the pulmonary lesions and lesion’s

424

extent at day 7, suggesting a potential antiviral activity in the infected lung epithelium [19].

425

However, exploring antiviral activity on in vitro coronavirus infection models needs to be

426

accomplished.

427

Here, we explored the putative antiviral effect of CIGB-325 using a bovine coronavirus

428

infection model and further interrogated those molecular events that might support such

429

antiviral effect. First of all, CIGB-325 exhibited a dose-dependent antiviral activity against

430

BCoV-Mebus according to two different experimental readouts, inhibition of the cytopathic

431

effect and reduction of the viral titer assessed by plaque assay in MDBK cells. Similar to the

432

inhibition of SARS-Cov2 infection by CX-4945 previously reported on Vero-E6 cells [12], the

433

treatment with this specific CK2 inhibitor also elicited anti-BCoV-Mebus activity on MDBK

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447588; this version posted June 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

434

cells in this experimental setting. Thus, the anti-CoV activity of two different CK2 inhibitors

435

supports an instrumental role of the CK2-mediated phosphorylation during infection by this

436

type of Coronaviridae. In line with the antiviral activity of CIGB-325 in BCoV-Mebus-infected

437

MDBK cells, the levels of BCoV N mRNA were down-regulated by CIGB-325 treatment as

438

determined by qRT-PCR. However, whether this down-regulation is caused by direct inhibition

439

of the viral RNA transcription derived from CK2 blocking or it is rather a consequence of the

440

antiviral activity by CIGB-325, remains to be elucidated. Accordingly, we also observed a

441

reduction in BCoV M and N protein levels by western blot and in situ immunocytochemistry,

442

suggesting an impairment of the viral protein synthesis machinery by CIGB-325.

443

As CIGB-325 impairs the CK2-mediated phosphorylation through binding to acidic

444

phosphoacceptor domain at the substrates [13], and considering that the coronavirus N protein

445

is a predicted phosphoprotein with multiple putative CK2 phosphorylation sites [33], we also

446

investigated whether CIGB-325 targets the BCoV-N protein. The in vitro and in vivo pull-down

447

followed by western blot experiments confirmed the typical physic interaction between CIGB-

448

325 and the N protein from BCoV-Mebus. However, additional experiments are required to

449

decipher if CIGB-325 binds directly to BCoV-Mebus N protein or indirectly through unknown

450

cellular protein complexes. Prompted by recent evidences that have shown physical interaction

451

and co-localization between the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and protein kinase CK2 [12, 34], we

452

looked for such interaction in our model. Data from immunoprecipitation experiments clearly

453

corroborated the interaction between CK2 and viral N protein in the context of BCoV-Mebus

454

infection, thus pointing out this protein as a putative CK2 substrate.

455

Beyond the physical interaction of CIGB-325 with the viral N protein, we wanted to explore

456

whether other viral and host proteins could be targeted by CIGB-325, thus being relevant for

457

its antiviral activity on BCoV-Mebus infection. Interestingly, the CIGB-325 interactomic

458

profile on infected MDBK cells confirmed the interaction between viral N protein with CIGB-

459

325 and also the interaction with NSp2a. Regarding host identified proteins, those representing

460

functional clusters participating in protein folding, cytoskeleton organization and cell cycle

461

were the most representative from the constructed protein-protein interaction network as well

462

as functional enrichment analysis. Interestingly, these three cellular processes are all relevant

463

for the coronavirus life cycle [12, 40, 41].

464

Furthermore, we interrogated the CIGB-325 interactomic profile for the presence of CK2

465

substrates and found that 30% (15 proteins) corresponded to previously validated CK2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.08.447588; this version posted June 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

466

substrates [31, 32]. A priori, these data reinforce the notion that inhibition of the CK2-mediated

467

phosphorylation could play a central role mediating the CIGB-325 antiviral activity during

468

BCoV-Mebus infection. However, three different CK2 substrates targeted by CIGB-325 might

469

be of particular relevance concerning the antiviral activity on BCoV-Mebus infection due to its

470

already known proviral function. That is the case of B23/NPM protein, a major target for

471

CIGB-325 in solid tumor cells [42], that plays an important role as a proviral chaperone in

472

animal and human virus infections [43-45]. Moreover, the myosin heavy chain 9 (MYL9) is

473

another bonafide CK2 substrate whose phosphorylation at the S1943 is upregulated during

474

infection of Vero-E6 cells by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Likewise, the heat shock protein 90 alpha

475

family class B member 1 (HSP90AB1) has been identified as a viral RNA interacting protein

476

significantly up-regulated during the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle in the RNA-bound

477

proteome on infected lung cells. Consistently, compounds targeting this protein showed a

478

strong inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protein production [46]. Therefore, B23/NPM, MYH9 and

479

HSP90AB1 represent cellular CK2 substrates whose inhibition by CIGB-325 along with that

480

on viral N protein, may impact the BCoV-Mebus viral machinery eliciting antiviral activity.

481

However, our data do not preclude that other CK2 substrates unveiled among CIGB-325

482

interacting proteins might be also involved in the antiviral activity.

483

The CIGB-325 interactomic data originated from different modalities of pull-down

484

experiments here is rather linked to the ability to target the phosphoaceptor domain at the CK2

485

substrates initially described for this peptide inhibitor [13] However an alternative mechanism

486

of inhibiting the CK2-mediated phosphorylation by direct targeting the CK2 catalytic subunit

487

of the enzyme was recently described for CIGB-325 [15]. Importantly, our in vivo pull-down

488

experiments revealed that CIGB-325 can also interact with CK2 catalytic subunit in MDBK

489

cells as it has been previously evidenced in lung cancer and leukemia cells [14, 15]. In line

490

with the abovementioned, the treatment with CIGB-325 showed an impairment of the

491

PI3K/AKT pathway, a CK2 mediated signaling pathway, evaluated by the phosphorylation of

492

downstream signaling protein RPS6. Noteworthy, whether this dual anti-CK2 inhibitory

493

mechanism described for CIGB-325 in other cellular contexts could also be running in parallel,

494

remains to be elucidated.

495

Further than describing the CIGB-325 antiviral activity on BCoV-Mebus infection and provide

496

clues on the molecular basis of such effect, our data could also suggest an immediate

497

therapeutic tool to treat bovine coronavirus infection. In fact, BCoV is an important livestock

498

pathogen with a high prevalence worldwide causing respiratory disease and diarrhea in calves

5. Conclusions

502

In conclusion, we have described for the first time the in vitro antiviral activity of CIGB-325

503

during the BCoV-Mebus infection which corroborates the instrumental role of the CK2-

504

mediated phosphorylation for life cycle of coronavirus. Accordingly, CIGB-325 targeted viral

proteins, an array of host CK2 substrates and the CK2 enzyme itself which could all represent

506

crucial molecular clues supporting the antiviral activity. Our data unveil the feasibility of

507

inhibiting CK2 as a promising pharmacological strategy to treat Coronavirus infection and

508

point out CIGB-325 as a putative antiviral drug to treat BCoV and other human

509

Betacoronavirus.

Figure 1. In vitro antiviral activity of CIGB-325 against BCoV-Mebus. MDBK cells were pre-treated with
CIGB-325 at the indicated doses for 1 h, and virus (14 000 TCID50/well) was then added to allow attachment for
1 h. Afterward, the cells were incubated in the presence of the indicated drug concentration for 4 days. A. IC50
(left axis) and CC50 (right axis) were estimated from the fitted dose-response curves based on treatment with five
CIGB-325 concentrations determined by cell viability assay (left section). Crystal violet stain wells for each
experimental condition in the CPE inhibition assay (right section). B. Antiviral effect of positive (IFN-alpha2b,
CX-4945) and negative controls (F20.2) were determined by cell viability assay using crystal violet stain. Cells
were infected as previously described and incubated with CIGB-325 (30 µM), F20.2 (30 µM), CX-4945 (1.25
µM) and IFN-alpha2b (500 IU). Uninfected cells with the vehicle were set to 100%. C. Progeny titer of the cell
cultures supernatants collected from CPE inhibition experiments were assessed using plaque assay. Data from B.
and C. are shown as mean ± SD, n = 3. Statistically significant differences between vehicle and drug treatment
are represented as **p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001 determined using one-way ANOVA followed Dunnett post-test.

Figure 2. Impact of CIGB-325 over BCoV-Mebus viral machinery. A. MDBK cells were treated with the
drugs 1 h before the viral challenge. Afterward, cells were infected with BCoV-Mebus (70 000 TCID50/well) and
the appropriate drug’s concentration was maintained. Effect of CIGB-325 over the viral protein expression at 24
h post-infection was investigated using qRT-PCR (A), Western blot (B) and Immunocytochemistry (C). qRTPCR reaction was performed with specific oligonucleotides corresponding to N protein. N expression was
normalized to gapdh and hmbs genes, and expressed as copy number obtained after extrapolation in a calibration
curve. Values are presented as mean ± SD (n = 9). Statistically significant differences between vehicle and drug
treatment are represented as **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 determined using one-way ANOVA followed Dunnett
post-test. Cell preparations for western blot and Immunocytochemistry were carried out as described in Materials
and Methods. A human anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody from one COVID-19 convalescent patient was
used for identification of BCoV-Mebus M and N protein. Anti-β-tubulin blot was used as loading control. Viral
proteins and β-tubulin protein were blotted in the same gel.

Figure 3. Interaction of CIGB-325 with BCoV-Mebus N protein. A. Western blot analysis of in vitro and in
vivo pull-down fractions using CIGB-325 conjugated to biotin as bait to capture interacting proteins. In vitro pulldown was performed with cellular lysates from infected MDBK cells incubated 30 min with biotin-tagged CIGB325 (100 μM). Subsequently, 30 µL of streptavidin-sepharose were added to each reaction and the CIGB-325
interacting proteins were eluted, resolved in 12%-SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blot to identify the viral
N protein. For in vivo pull-down, MDBK cells were treated 30 min with biotin-tagged CIGB-325 (100 μM),
subsequently lysed and processed as indicated above. PD: pull-down fractions; PASS: flow-through fractions;
NC: negative control (cellular lysate from MDBK cells incubated with the vehicle). B. Representative images
obtained by confocal microscopy showing the co-localization of CIGB-325-F with BCoV-Mebus N protein after
30 min of incubation on infected MDBK cells. Red fluorescence: N protein-derived signal; Green: CIGB-325derived signal; Blue: nuclear DAPI; Orange: merge of Green/Red channels representing co-localization signal.
