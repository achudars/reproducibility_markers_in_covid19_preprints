Abstract

20

Transfusion of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma is a promising treatment for severe

21

COVID-19 cases, with success of the intervention based on neutralizing antibody content.

22

Measurement by serological correlates without biocontainment needs, and an understanding of

23

donor characteristics that may allow for targeting of more potent donors would greatly facilitate

24

effective collection.

Text
The transfusion of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of infectious diseases has

28

been in medical use for more than 100 years and was found worthy of the first Nobel Prize in

29

Medicine, awarded to Emil von Behring in 1901. Based on some earlier successes of CP therapy

30

with the other two zoonotic coronaviruses that have caused large numbers of severe respiratory

31

infections in humans during the last two decades, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (1, 2), its use

32

was quickly initiated after the emergence of the now pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 (3-5).

33

For the identification of potential SARS-CoV-2 CP donors, different analytical

34

approaches are possible, and some have been suggested (6, 7). These include detection of the

35

virus by nucleic acid testing during acute infection, and after convalescence the detection of

36

virus binding antibodies by ELISA, lateral flow or Western blot assays, or the detection of

37

functional antibodies by virus microneutralization test (MNT)(8). Only a MNT provides for a

38

functional correlate of antiviral efficacy and this assay is therefore still considered as ‘gold

39

standard’ in serological testing, yet testing needs to be conducted under level 3 biosafety

40

containment restrictions (BSL3), requires a few days to generate results and is more complex to

41

perform. It would thus greatly facilitate testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in potential plasma

42

donors and their donations, if a more simple and easily scalable binding assay can be correlated

43

against functional antibody activity as determined by MNT.

44

In addition, CP collections might become more effective if donor characteristics were

45

understood to correlate with higher functional antibody activity, such as e.g. disease severity,

46

days between disease onset and plasma collection, or age and sex of donors.

47

The Austrian Red Cross Blood Service for Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland

48

initiated the collection of virus-inactivated CP by plasmapheresis at the Vienna Blood Centre and

49

the first 100 CP units collected were tested for functionally active neutralizing antibodies by

50

MNT (Attachment). While the absolute numbers generated by any such assay need to await

51

availability of international reference standards before any meaningful comparison becomes

52

possible, on average the CP units had high neutralizing antibody titer, with a mean

53

microneutralization titer 50% (NT50) of approx. 1:230 (Figure 1A – NT50 histogram, median

54

1:100, 25% percentile 1:54, 75% percentile 1:231, range < 1:8 – 1:1765). Somewhat surprisingly

55

for individuals who had successfully recovered from NAT-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,

56

neutralizing antibodies were undetectable in one plasma unit, and for a total of six units (6%) the

57

NT50s were below 1:23, i.e. INV log2 NT50 4.5 (Figure 1A).

58

A binding antibody assay was also performed on these CP units (Attachment), with the

59

intention to establish a correlation between the functionally more relevant MNT and the more

60

accessible ELISA, as well as an ELISA threshold to allow for the elimination of sub-potent units

61

and the qualification of CP units for transfusion. For the totality of the samples for which valid

62

results from both assays were available (N = 83), the correlation between results from the MNT

63

and the ELISA was highly significant (p < 0.0001), yet quantitatively limited (R2 = 0.2830)

64

(Figure 1B). With the intention of using the ELISA primarily for establishing a lower threshold

65

for CP units to issue them for treatment of COVID-19 cases, the analysis was repeated excluding

66

particularly high NT50 titers (>1:500, N = 12 / 14.5%), which improved the correlation (R2 =

67

0.5386; Figure 1B). Using the Euroimmun ELISA 1.1 cut-off for positivity to qualify units for

68

transfusion, 6 units (7.2%) with an average NT50 of 1:29 would have been excluded, with a

69

corresponding increase of the mean NT50 of all collected plasma units from 1:233 (N = 83) to

70

1:249 (N = 77). A final verdict about whether this cut-off is suitable for use of CP in the

71

treatment of COVID-19 will have to await an evaluation of clinical efficacy in correlation to

72

these antibody measurements.

73

For the targeted collection of high antibody titer CP units it would be helpful to

74

understand donor characteristics that might correlate with higher antibody potency, for example

75

it has been suggested that increasing disease severity may result in the development of higher

76

antibody titers (9). Of the 100 plasma donors, 90 were classified into WHO disease severity

77

scores of 1 and 2 (10), with an average NT50 of 1:208, versus only 6 donors in disease severity

78

scores of 3 to 6, who had a mean NT50 antibody titer of 1:696. While these results may seem to

79

support the notion of higher titers with increased disease severity, the numbers of CP donors in

80

higher WHO scores in this study are too low to determine significance. For CP donor age (Figure

81

2A), the NT50s were significantly correlated (p = 0.0019), yet with little predictive value (R2 =

82

0.09466) and targeting advance age donors for CP collection may therefore not be very effective.

83

On average, the CP collected from male donors (N = 61) had a significantly higher mean NT50

84

than from female donors (N=38), yet whether the mean titer difference of 1:220 has any

85

functional relevance is questionable (Figure 2B).

Conclusions
While functional testing for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies would be desirable for

89

CP units before issuing them for treatment of COVID-19, biosafety requirements and

90

considerations around assay duration and complexity make this approach impractical. An

91

adequate pooling strategy of convalescent plasma may level out variations of antibody titers and

92

quality in the therapeutic units. Here we have established an ELISA-based correlate to the MNT,

93

with a threshold proposal that could be used to eliminate lower titer units from the clinical supply

94

for COVID-19 treatment. Disease severity may be associated with the development of higher

95

titers of neutralizing antibodies, although larger case numbers will be needed for a final

96

conclusion. And while age and gender are significantly correlated with MNT antibody levels, the

97

differences are small and thus probably not helpful for CP donor targeting.
