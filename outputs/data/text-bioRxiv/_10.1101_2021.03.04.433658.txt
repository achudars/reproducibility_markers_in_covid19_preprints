Abstract
Since understanding molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection is extremely
important for developing effective therapies against COVID-19, we focused on the
internalization mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 via ACE2. Although cigarette smoke is generally
believed to be harmful to the pathogenesis of COVID-19, cigarette smoke extract (CSE)
treatments were surprisingly found to suppress the expression of ACE2 in HepG2 cells. We
thus tried to clarify the mechanism of CSE effects on expression of ACE2 in mammalian
cells. Because RNA-seq analysis suggested that suppressive effects on ACE2 might be
inversely correlated with induction of the genes regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AHR), the AHR agonists 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) and omeprazole (OMP)
were tested to assess whether those treatments affected ACE2 expression. Both FICZ and
OMP clearly suppressed ACE2 expression in a dose-dependent manner along with inducing
CYP1A1. Knock-down experiments indicated a reduction of ACE2 by FICZ treatment in an
AHR-dependent manner. Finally, treatments of AHR agonists inhibited SARS-CoV-2
infection into Vero E6 cells as determined with immunoblotting analyses detecting SARSCoV-2 specific nucleocapsid protein. We here demonstrate that treatment with AHR agonists,
including CSE, FICZ, and OMP, decreases expression of ACE2 via AHR activation, resulting
in suppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first
reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is rapidly and continuously spreading all over
the world [World Health Organization (WHO)/Coronavirus disease (SARS-CoV-2 induced
disease: COVID-19) pandemic] (WHO website). Many epidemiological studies have
suggested that smoking habits have serious effects on the pathogenesis of COVID-19
(Vardavas et al., 2020; Berlin et al., 2020; Guo, 2020; Kashyap, 2020). Expression of the
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was also
reported to be higher in smoking mice and humans, suggesting that smokers may be at a
higher risk of infection (Smith et al., 2020). On the other hand, several reports suggested
fewer smokers among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or lower numbers of SARS-CoV-2
positive cases among smokers than among non-smokers (Rentsch et al, 2020; Miyara et al,
2020; Lusignan et al,2020; Williamson et al., 2020). Therefore, the impact of smoking on
SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear. Cigarette smoke contains a variety of compounds, such as
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrosamines, and cellular responses to
cigarette smoke exposure are thus diverse (Zhang et al., 2012; AlQasrawi et al., 2020). PAHs
bind to and activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR, which is an intracellular receptor type
transcription factor), and induce various cellular physiological and pathological responses

through the regulation of gene expression (Hankinson, 1995; Moorthy et al., 2015). AHR is
also activated by a broad variety of exogenous and endogenous small molecular weight
compounds, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 3,3’,4,4’,5-pentac
hlorobiphenyl-126 (PCB126), 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ), and omeprazole, and
their physiological and pathological significance, especially in regard to the immune system,
have received much attention (Denison et al., 2003; Gutiérrez-Vázquez et al., 2018;
Rothhammer et al., 2019).
In this study, we therefore aimed to clarify the effects of components of cigarette smoke
and AHR agonists on ACE2 expression in mammalian cells to better understand the role of
ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 internalization mechanism.

Results
Effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on ACE2 expression in human cell lines
At first we examined expression levels of the SARS-CoV-2 viral receptor ACE2 in
various cell lines by using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) (Supplementary File 1a). Results
demonstrated that ACE2 expression level varied among the cell lines, and HSC2 (oral cavity
origin), PC9 (lung origin), and HepG2 (liver origin), which had the highest levels of ACE2
expression, were used in the first experiment. The cells were treated with various doses of

cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 24 hours, after which expression level of cytochrome P450
family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) gene, which is known to be CSE-inducible, was
evaluated with qRT-PCR. As expected, CSE treatment induced expression of CYP1A1 in
HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1a). CSE treatment also induced expression
of CYP1A1 in PC9 cells, but expression was only slightly increased in HSC2 cells
(Supplementary File 1b). Interestingly, ACE2 expression was significantly reduced in CSEtreated HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and was slightly reduced in PC9 and HSC2
cells (Figure 1b and Supplementary File 1c).

To elucidate cellular responses to treatment with CSE, comprehensive gene expression
was investigated with RNA-seq analysis. Results demonstrated that CSE increased the
expression of 1937 genes and decreased that of 624 genes in HepG2 cells. Gene set
enrichment analysis demonstrated that CSE increased the expressions of genes related to a
variety of intracellular signals, such as organic anion transport, chemical carcinogenesis, and
cellular hormone metabolic processes, which were regulated by various transcription factors,
including PPAR, AHR, HNF1A, ARNT, and GATA4 (Figure 1c-d). CSE-decreased genes
indicated the involvement of signals, such as camera-type eye photoreceptor cell
differentiation, cellular response to ammonium ion, and positive regulation of cytokinemediated signaling pathway, although they were not significant (Figure 1e). Among them, we
first focused on AHR signals, which were executed by heterodimeric transcription factors of
AHR and ARNT.

RNA-seq analysis of HepG2 cells treated with AHR agonists
To more directly observe the mechanism by which AHR signal acts on ACE2 expression,
effects of AHR agonists, such as FICZ and OMP, were evaluated in HepG2 cells. RNA-seq
analysis demonstrated that FICZ and OMP increased expression of 1804 or 2106 genes,
respectively, and decreased that of 830 or 1136 genes, respectively (Figure 2a). Hierarchical

clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that signals regulated by FICZ
and OMP were relatively more similar than they were with those regulated by CSE, but the
transcriptome of FICZ differed from that of OMP, as judged from the PCA result (Figure 2b,
c). The RNA-seq data suggested that the CYP1A1 gene was strongly induced in HepG2 cells
with FICZ and OMP treatments, but expression of the ACE2 gene was clearly inhibited
(Figure 2d). A Venn diagram indicated that 546 genes were commonly upregulated and 269
genes were commonly downregulated in CSE-, FICZ-, or OMP-treated cells (Figure 2e, i).
Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that commonly regulated genes were related to
metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, which is known to be regulated by an AHR
signal (Figure 2f, g, j, and k). Interestingly, an RNA-seq dataset composed of SARS-CoV-2
infection experiments (Coronasacape: a customized version of Metascape bioinformatic
platform that provides a central clearinghouse for scientists to laser focus their OMICS
analysis and data-mining efforts) suggested that the commonly regulated genes noted here
overlapped with the genes modified after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2h, l).

Effects of AHR agonists on ACE2 expression in HepG2 cells
qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that FICZ and OMP efficiently induced expression of
the AHR-target gene, CYP1A1, in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3a). Importantly,
treatment with FICZ or OMP significantly suppressed ACE2 expression in HepG2 cells
(Figure 3b). Furthermore, immunoblotting analysis confirmed that ACE2 protein expression
was suppressed by treatment with FICZ or OMP, consistent with their effect on ACE2 gene
expression (Figure 3c). Analysis of the dose dependence of FICZ and OMP demonstrated that
induction of CYP1A1 and suppression of ACE2 by FICZ both appeared to saturate at
approximately 40 nM, whereas corresponding effects of OMP increased up to 100 μM (Figure
3d-g).
Next, time-dependency of AHR agonists was evaluated. Treatment with 100 nM of FICZ
increased CYP1A1 expression to a maximum at 24 hours, after which it decreased up to 72
hours, whereas ACE2 expression was suppressed to the greatest extent at 24 hours followed
by a return to the original expression level at 72 hours (Figure 3h, i). Treatment with 100 μM
OMP produced delayed responses in comparison with FICZ, the highest CYP1A1 induction
and greatest ACE2 suppression being at 48 hours (Figure 3h, i). These observations were also
confirmed by protein levels with immunoblotting analysis (Figure 3j).

Role of AHR in ACE2 suppression in HepG2 cells
To confirm that the effects of FICZ and OMP on ACE2 suppression were actually
dependent on AHR, knock-down experiments were performed. Effective knock-down of AHR
in DMSO or FICZ treated HepG2 cells was confirmed with qRT-PCR, and CYP1A1 induction
with FICZ treatment was significantly inhibited in AHR knocked-down cells (Figure 4a, b).
Under this condition, ACE2 expression in AHR knocked-down cells after treatment with
FICZ increased up to the level in control cells, indicating a critical role of AHR in FICZinduced ACE2 suppression (Figure 4c).

Effects of AHR agonists on SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells
To clarify the effect of AHR agonist-induced ACE2 suppression on SARS-CoV-2
infection of mammalian cells, Vero E6 cells expressing TMPRSS2, which are known to be
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, were employed in infection experiments (Matsuyama
et al., 2020). ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells was first evaluated by qRT-PCR and found to
be downregulated by treatment with FICZ or OMP (Figure 5a). Immunoblotting analysis with
antibody against a specific SARS-CoV-2 protein, nucleocapsid protein, demonstrated that
pre-treatment with FICZ or OMP decreased levels of nucleocapsid protein in a dosedependent manner, suggesting a decrease in the number of viruses infecting the cells (Figure
5b).

Discussion

ACE2 was identified as the virus receptor during the first SARS-CoV epidemic, and
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been shown to bind ACE2 on host cells, resulting in receptormediated internalization of the virus (Wan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Therefore,
modulators of expression levels of ACE2 may regulate the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We here demonstrated that CSE, FICZ, and OMP, which could all act as agonists of AHR,
suppressed the expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells, resulting in suppression of
internalization of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 expression was significantly decreased in CSE-treated

HepG2 cells, whereas CYP1A1 expression was induced. ACE2 expression was slightly
decreased in PC9 and HSC2 cells, in which CYP1A1 expression was slightly increased. These
results suggest that ACE2 reduction is inversely correlated with induction of one of the wellknown AHR target genes, CYP1A1, although treatment optimization is necessary in each cell
line. RNA-seq analysis of CSE treated HepG2 cells also demonstrated that CSE treatment
modified a variety of intracellular signals that are regulated by the transcription factors PPAR,
AHR, HNF1A, and GATA4 (Figure 1c-f). Furthermore, treatment with FICZ or OMP
modified many important signals, such as response to wounding, metabolism of xenobiotics
by cytochrome P450, the matrisome, and leukocyte differentiation, which were strongly
suggested to be regulated by AHR (Supplementary File 2). As expected, treatment with FICZ
(a tryptophan metabolite) or OMP (a proton pump inhibitor) effectively induced CYP1A1
expression in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, both AHR agonists
clearly reduced ACE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, knockdown experiments of AHR confirmed that reduction of ACE2 with FICZ treatment was
dependent on AHR, although details of the molecular mechanism are as yet undetermined.
There are several reports of AHR-mediated suppression of gene expression. One is that AHR
suppresses thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) gene expression via phosphorylation of
p300 by Protein Kinase C (PKC) δ, resulting in decreases in acetylation and DNA binding

activity of NF-κB (Jeong et al., 2019). Another is decreased expression of the AP-1 family
member Junb, which was substantially upregulated in the inflamed skin of Ahr-deficient mice
(Di Meglio et al., 2014). Finally, AHR was further demonstrated to form a complex with
Stat1 and NF-κB in macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulting in
inhibition of promoter activity of the IL6 gene (Kimura et al., 2009). Since Genome Browser
notes that ChIP-seq datasets in ENCODE actually indicate p300 and JUN binding on the
human ACE2 gene, ACE2 downregulation by AHR agonist treatments might occur via
functional interactions between AHR and those transcription factors. Furthermore, RNA-seq
analysis in the present study revealed that treatment with several AHR agonists
downregulated some GATA4-regulated genes in HepG2 cells, so crosstalk between AHR and
GATA4 might also be a possible mechanism of ACE2 regulation (Supplementary File 2g).

Another interesting observation in this study was the difference in time course effects
of FICZ and OMP. FICZ seemed to affect ACE2 expression early and suppression by FICZ
was quickly reduced, but the effect of OMP seemed to be more gradual and suppression by
OMP remained up to 72 hours. This may be because of different activities and kinetics of
their metabolism. Several other tryptophan metabolites, indole 3-carbinol (I3C), indoleacetic
acid (IAA), tryptamine (TA), and L-kynurenine (KYN), and proton pump inhibitors,

rabeprazole sodium (RBP), lansoprazole (LSP), and tenatoprazole (TNP), were also tested as
to whether they regulate ACE2 expression; it was demonstrated that most of them decreased
expression of ACE2 with a variety of actions and increased expression of CYP1A1
(Supplementary File 3a, b). Similar differences were also observed among cell lines tested
here (Figure 1). Optimization of each compound will be necessary in the next steps (in vivo
experiments and clinical studies), although most of the tryptophan metabolites and proton
pump inhibitors seem to be safely applicable to clinical therapeutic research. One limitation of
this strategy might be that these drugs do not target the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself but just
modify cellular susceptibility to it. Combination therapies of AHR agonists with anti-virus
drugs, such as favipiravir or remdesivir, are therefore possible strategies for clinical
application.

In addition to modifying cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, treatment with AHR
agonists might stimulate immune response in the treated cells without virus infection. An
RNA-seq dataset composed of SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments suggested that genes
regulated by CSE, FICZ, and OMP overlapped with genes modified by SARS-CoV-2
infection, suggesting that stimulation of the immune system is involved (Figure 2h and k,

Supplementary Figures 2d and h). These observations might signify a potentially useful
clinical application, although further investigation will be necessary to elucidate the details.

In conclusion, we here demonstrated that treatment with CSE or AHR agonists
decreased expression of ACE2 in mammalian cells, resulting in suppression of SARS-CoV-2
infection (Figure 6). Application of these compounds in clinical research and in clinical
practice might be warranted.

Materials and methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were analytical grade and were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure
Chemicals, Sigma-Aldrich, or Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI).

CSE preparation

CSE was prepared by using a modified method reported previously (Kida et al., 2021).
A detailed protocol is available at protocols.io
(https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bnymmfu6). Briefly, 5 filtered cigarettes were
smoked consecutively through an experimental apparatus with a constant airflow (0.3 L/min)
driven by a syringe, and the smoke was bubbled through 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). The CSE obtained was then passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore). The CSE was
prepared immediately before each experiment.

Cell lines and RNA preparation
Human and monkey cell lines were purchased from the Japanese Cancer Research
Resource Bank (JCRRB) and have been maintained as original stocks. The cells were

normally maintained in RPMI1640 or DMEM (NACALAI TESQUE) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; BioWhittaker) and 100 μg/mL kanamycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and were
used within 6 months of passage from original stocks. For this study, cells (1 x 106) were
seeded on 10 cm diameter dishes and incubated for 24 hours, then treated with various kinds
of chemicals for the indicated periods. They were then harvested for expression analysis with
RNA-seq, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting. For knock-down experiments, nonspecific (siNS, No. 1027310) or AHR (siAHR, SI02780148) siRNA (QIAGEN, Inc.) was
transfected with LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) into HepG2
cells (1 x 106/10 cm diameter dish) for 12 hours, and then the cells were incubated with
DMSO or FICZ for 24 hours. Cells were then harvested and stored at −80 ˚C until use. Total
RNA was prepared from frozen cell pellets by using NucleoSpin® RNA (MACHEREYNAGEL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Two µg of total RNA extracted from each cell line was reverse-transcribed using a HighCapacity cDNA ArchiveTM Kit (Applied Biosystems). A two-hundredth aliquot of the cDNA
was subjected to qRT-PCR with primers (final concentration 200 nM each) and MGB probe
(final concentration 100 nM; the Universal Probe Library [UPL], Roche Diagnostics) sets as

shown in Supplementary File 4 for human ACE2, CYP1A1, AHR, and for primate ACE2 and
ACTB. Pre-Developed TaqManTM Assay Reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used for human
ACTB as an internal control. PCR reactions were carried out with a 7500 Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems) under standard conditions. Relative gene expression levels
were calculated by using ACTB expression as the denominator for each cell line.

RNA-sequence analysis
Total RNA was processed with a TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample prep kit (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA) (Sumi et al., 2019). Poly(A) RNA libraries were then constructed using
the TruSeq Stranded mRNA library preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced in 100-bp
paired-end reads on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform (Sumi et al., 2019). RNA-Seq was
performed in triplicate.
RNA-seq reads were quantified by using ikra (v.1.2.2) (Hiraoka et al., 2019), an
RNA-seq pipeline centered on Salmon (Patro et al., 2017). The ikra pipeline automated the
RNA-seq data-analysis process, including the quality control of reads [sra-tools v.2.10.7, Trim
Galore v.0.6.3 (Krueger et al., 2020) using Cutadapt v.1.9.1 (Martin, 2011)], and transcript
quantification (Salmon v.0.14.0, using reference transcript sets in GENCODE release 31 for

were imported into integrated differential expression and pathway analysis (iDEP v.0.91), an
integrated web application for gene ontology (GO) analysis of RNA-seq data
(http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/) (Ge et al., 2018). Quantified transcript reads were
filtered at a threshold of 0.5 counts per million (CPM) in at least one sample and transformed
as log2(CPM + c) with EdgeR (3.28.0), with a pseudocount c value of 4. Gene set enrichment
analysis was performed in iDEP with the fold-change values returned by DESeq2 (1.26.0).
False positive rates of q < 0.05 were considered enriched and investigated further with
Metascape (Zhou et al., 2019). The TRRUST method (Han et al., 2015; Han et al., 2018),
which analyzes human transcriptional regulatory interactions, was applied by using the webbased Metascape, a gene annotation and analysis resource algorithm
(https://metascape.org/) (Zhou et al., 2019). A Venn diagram was constructed by using
jvenn, a plug-in for the jQuery javascript library (http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html).

Virus infection analysis
To observe the efficiency of infection of mammalian cells by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV2/JP/Hiroshima-46059T/2020 and TMPRSS2 transfected Vero E6 cells were employed
(Matsuyama et al., 2020). Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells in a 24 well plate were treated with FICZ
or OMP for 24 hours before virus infections. The cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2

at an input multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and incubated for 24 hours. After the cells were
washed with PBS, cell lysates were obtained by directly adding SDS-sample buffer and then
subjected to immunoblotting analysis.

Immunoblot analysis
To analyze protein expression, whole cell extracts were prepared from cultured cells with
the indicated treatments as previously described (Tanimoto et al., 2000). Fifty g of extracts
was blotted onto nitrocellulose filters following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
Anti-ACE2 (GTX101395, GeneTex), anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
(GTX632269, GeneTex), or anti--actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the primary
antibody, diluted 1:1000, 1:1000, or 1:5000, respectively. A 1:2000 dilution of anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (#7076, #7074, Cell Signaling
TECHNOLOGY) was used as a secondary antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by
using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ECL Plus (Amersham Life Science).

Statistical Analysis
Statistical tests were based on the ANOVA test, Student’s t test, Dunnett’s test, or the
Gemes-Howell test in SPSS Statistics version 17.0 (IBM).
