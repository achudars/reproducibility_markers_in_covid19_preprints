Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) has accumulated multiple
mutations during its global circulation. Recently, a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 (VUI 202012/01)
had been identified leading to sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in South-East England. The strain
has accumulated 23 mutations which have been

mutations occurring in spike (S), ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Some of
these mutations might confer higher fitness to SARS-CoV-2.

Summary
Since initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan city of central China, its causative agent; SARSCoV-2 virus has claimed more than 1.7 million lives out of 77 million populations and still
counting. As a result of global research efforts involving public-private-partnerships, more than
0.2 million complete genome sequences have been made available through Global Initiative on
Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Similar to previously characterized coronaviruses (CoVs),
the positive-sense single-stranded RNA SARS-CoV-2 genome codes for ORF1ab non-structural
proteins (nsp(s)) followed by ten or more structural/nsps [1, 2]. The structural proteins include
crucial spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins. The S protein
mediates

initial

hosts

while

and

assembly and budding. In recent reports on evolution of SARS-CoV-2, three lineage defining
non-synonymous mutations; namely D614G in S protein (Clade G), G251V in ORF3a (Clade V)
and L84S in ORF 8 (Clade S) were observed [2-4]. The latest pioneering works by Plante et al and
Hou et al have shown that compared to ancestral strain, the ubiquitous D614G variant (clade G)
of

SARS-CoV-2

exhibits

efficient

replication

cells

and

transmission, thereby conferring higher fitness [5, 6]. As per latest WHO reports on COVID-19, a
new strain referred as SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 (Variant Under Investigation, year 2020,
month 12, variant 01) had been identified as

a part of virological and epidemiological analysis,

due to sudden rise in COVID-19 detected cases in South-East England [7]. Preliminary reports
from UK suggested higher transmissibility (increase by 40-70%) of this strain, escalating Ro
(basic reproduction number) of virus to 1.5-1.7 [7, 8]. This apparent fast spreading variant
inculcates 23 mutations; 13 non-synonymous,

6 synonymous and 4 amino acid deletions [7]. In

the current scenario, where immunization programs have already commenced in nations highly
affected by COVID-19, advent of this new strain variant has raised concerns worldwide on its
possible role in disease severity and antibody responses. The mutations also could also have
significant impact on diagnostic assays owing to S gene target failures.

of

COVID-3D suite [9, 10]. Images were created using PyMol [11]. In S gene, besides H69, V70 and
Y144 deletion in its N-terminal domain (NTD), N501Y in the receptor binding domain (RBD),
A570D in sub-domain-1 (SD1), P681H near the host processing furin cleavage site and T716I,
S982A, D1118H in S2 domains were observed. The H69, V70 and Y144 were observed to be

[8].

In

two

recent

studies,

monoclonal antibodies isolated from convalescent COVID-19 patients were found to interact
specifically with NTD of S protein and its associated mutations could confer antibody resistance
[12, 13]. As per latest reports, the most concerning mutation was N501Y in RBD region can
promote binding of S protein with host ACE2 receptors [14]. In crystal structure complex (PDB
id: 6m0j), N501 of RBD (S protein) forms H-bond with Y41 of ACE2 receptors. Mutation analysis
of the complex revealed a stronger interaction network of Y501 compared to wild-type N501

two antibodies share distinct epitopes on RBD of S protein (Supplementary Figure 2B). A recent
analysis (preprint) identified new genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 which can evade host immune
responses [16]. In Australia, out of 24 immune escape variants, S477N mutant was present in
>60%

of

genome

samples.

This

mutation

was

outside

RBD-C135/CR3022

interface

(Supplementary Figure 2B). For India, N440K high frequency variant was observed out of 19
immune escape variants [16]. This mutation is located at C135 interaction interface. In wild
type strain, N440 forms a strong H-bond network with D54 and weak H-bond networks with
P52 and R55 of C135 antibody (Supplementary Figure 2C). The K440 mutant however, only
forms a weak H-bond with D54 (Supplementary Figure 2D). This could possibly explain immune
evasion

as

suggested

Gupta

for

in

healthcare workers from India [17]. Interestingly, we observed 100% co-occurrence on N440K
mutation along C64F mutation in membrane glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 apart from globally
dominant D614G (S protein) and P323L (ORF1ab) [4, 9]. The other new mutations in S protein
showed co-occurrence with only D614G-P323L type [9]. Taken together, the naturally occurring
mutations might confer resistance against one antibody, not other.

The ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 is proposed to interact with variety of host proteins and
modulate immune responses; and disruption of IFN-I signaling and downregulation of MHC-I in
cells [18, 19]. Crystal structure of ORF8 showed two dimerization interfaces unique to SARSCoV-2 genealogy. The R52I and Y73C mutations in SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 are localized at
these interaction interfaces. In wild type strain, R52 forms H-bond contact with I121 from
another protomer

(Figure 1D). Y73 forms part

of

crucial

assemblies,

possibly

aiding

SARS-CoV-2

to

and

immune

responses [18].

The SARS-CoV-2 N protein can exist both in monomeric and oligomeric forms, and interact with
RNA. The dimerization interface is formed through interactions of C-terminal domain (256-364,
PDB id: 6wzo) while the RNA interactions are mediated through its N-terminal domain (46-176,
PDB id: 7acs) (Figure 1E). Recently, it was shown that ORF9b (alternative ORF within N gene)
can

suppress

IFN-I

responses

through

or

induction of lactic acid production [20]. The D3L and S235F mutations in the N protein occur

regions,
