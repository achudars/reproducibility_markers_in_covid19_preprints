Abstract
Structural and biochemical studies SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants with the enhanced infectivity
have attracted significant attention and offered several mechanisms to explain the experimental
data. The development of a unified view and a working model which is consistent with the
diverse experimental data is an important focal point of the current work. In this study, we used
an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional
effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein
stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis along with

network-based

community analysis to simulate structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins
in different functional states. The results demonstrated that the D614 position anchors a key
regulatory cluster that dictates functional transitions between open and closed states. Using
molecular simulations and mutational sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we
showed that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and
open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. The results
offer

support to the reduced shedding mechanism of S1 domain as a driver of the increased

infectivity triggered by the D614G mutation. Through distance fluctuations communication
analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the
native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation
can enhance

long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine.

By employing network

community analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, our results revealed that the D614G
mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers
in the open form by reorganizing and

enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain

of the allosteric interactions and communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting
that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on

Introduction
Understanding of the molecular principles driving the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)1-5 has been at the focal point of
biomedical research since the start of the pandemic a year ago. SARS-CoV-2 infection is
transmitted when the viral spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the host cell receptor, leading to the
entry of S protein into host cells and membrane fusion.6-8 The full-length SARS-CoV-2 S
protein consists of two main domains, amino (N)-terminal S1 subunit and carboxyl (C)-terminal
S2 subunit. The subunit S1 is involved in the interactions with the host receptor and includes
an N-terminal domain (NTD), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and

two structurally

conserved subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Structural and biochemical studies have shown that the
mechanism of virus infection may involve spontaneous conformational transformations of the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein

between a spectrum of closed and receptor-accessible open forms,

where RBD continuously switches between “down” and “up” positions where the latter can
promote

binding with the host receptor ACE2.9-11 The S1 subunit is characterized by variant

regions, particularly in the receptor binding motif (RBM) interacting with the host receptor
ACE2 enzyme. The S1 regions also include C-terminal domain 1/CTD1 (or SD1) and Cterminal domain 2/CTD2 (or SD2) domains. Genomic studies established that the S2 subunit is
an evolutionary conserved fusion machinery that contains upstream helix (UH), an N-terminal
hydrophobic fusion peptide (FP), fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR),
(HR1), central helix region (CH),

heptad repeat 1

connector domain (CD), heptad repeat 2 (HR2),

transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT).12 The S1 regions are structurally
situated above the S2 subunit13-17 and serve as dynamic protective shield of the fusion machine.
Upon proteolytic activation at the S1/S2 and dissociation of S1 from S2, a cascade of tectonic

structural rearrangements in the S2 subunit is initiated to mediate the fusion of the viral and
cellular membranes.18,19 The

rapidly evolving body of

biophysical studies and cryo-EM

structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins characterized distinct conformational arrangements of
the S protein trimers in the prefusion form
between the closed (“RBD-down”)

and

that are manifested by a dynamic equilibrium
the receptor-accessible open (“RBD-up”)

form

required for the S protein fusion to the viral membrane.20-29 The recent cryo-EM structure of the
SARS-CoV-2 S trimer demonstrated a population-shift between a spectrum of closed states
that included a structurally rigid closed form and more dynamic closed states preceding a
transition to the fully open S conformation.30 Protein engineering and structural studies also
showed how disulfide bonds and proline mutations can modulate stability of the SARS-CoV-2
S trimer31 and lead to the thermodynamic shifts between the closed-down conformation and
the open form exposed to binding with the ACE2 host receptor.32-34 The cryo-EM structures and
biophysical tomography tools characterized the structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimers in
situ on the virion surface and confirmed a population shift between different functional states,
showing that conformational transitions can proceed through an obligatory intermediate in
which all three RBD domains are in the closed conformations and are oriented towards the viral
particle membrane.35,36 Cryo-EM structural studies also mapped a mechanism of conformational
events associated with ACE2 binding, showing that the compact closed form of the SARS-CoV2 S protein becomes weakened after furin cleavage between the S1 and S2 domains, leading to
the increased population of partially open states and followed by ACE2 recognition that
accelerates conformational transformations to a fully open and ACE2-bound form priming the
protein for fusion activation.37 Cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the presence
and absence of ACE2 receptor suggested a pH-dependent switch that mediates conformational

switching of RBD regions.38 This study demonstrated that pH-dependent refolding region
(residues 824-858) at the interdomain interface displayed dramatic structural rearrangements and
mediated coordinated movements of the entire trimer, giving rise to a single 1 RBD-up
conformation at pH 5.5 while all-down closed conformation was favorable at lower pH. 38
SARS-CoV-2 S mutants with the enhanced infectivity profile including D614G mutational
variant have attracted an enormous attention in the scientific community following the evidence
of

the mutation enrichment

experimental data and a

via epidemiological surveillance, resulting in proliferation of

considerable variety of

the proposed mechanisms explaining

functional observations.39-41 The latest biochemical studies provided a compelling evidence of a
phenotypic advantage and the enhanced infectivity conferred by the D614G mutation.42

The

recent structural and biochemical studies suggested that the D614G mutation can act by shifting
the population of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer from the closed form (53% of the equilibrium)
in the native spike protein to a widely-open topology of the “up” protomers in the D614G
mutant with

36% of the population adopting a single open protomer, 39% with two open

protomers and 20% with all three protomers in the open conformation.43

The cryo-EM

structures of the S-D614 and S-G614 ectodomains and the structure of the cleaved SG614 ectodomain detailed

subtle effects of the D614G mutation,

showing the increased

population of the 1-RBD-up open form over the closed state in the S-GSAS/D614G structure.44
This study also

demonstrated that

the S-D614G

mutant could modulate conformational

population of the S protein and result in the increased furin cleavage efficiency of the S
ectodomain. In addition, these experiments suggested that the D614G mutation in the SD2
domain can induce allosteric effect leading to coordinated movements and structural shifts
between the up and down RBD conformations.44 Negative stain electron microscopy revealed

the higher 84% percentage of the 1-up RBD conformation in the S-G614 protein, suggesting the
increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization.45 The
reported retroviruses pseudotyped with S-G614 showed a markedly greater infectivity than the
S-D614 protein that was correlated with a reduced S1 shedding, greater stability of the S-G614
mutant and more significant incorporation of the S protein into the pseudovirion.46
addition,

In

it was confirmed that the D614G mutation does not produce greater binding

affinity of S protein for ACE2 neither makes it more resistant to neutralization.46 This evidence
offered an alternative mechanism to the previously proposed functional scenario in which
D614G mutation would promote rather than limit shedding of the S1 domain.47 Consistent with
the reduced shedding mechanism induced by the D614G mutation, the reported cryo-EM
structures of a full-length S-G614 trimer featuring three distinct prefusion conformations
provided a mechanistic explanation for the increased stability of the highly infective mutant.48
According to this study, D614G may promote ordering of the partly disordered loop located
near the furin cleavage site that strengthens the inter-domain interactions between the NTD and
CTD1 regions and enhances the inter-protomer contacts and stability of the mutated S protein,
thereby inhibiting a premature dissociation of the S1 subunit which eventually leads to the
increased number of functional spikes and stronger infectivity.48 Structure-based protein design
and cryo-EM structure determination established that both D614G and D614N mutations can
result in the increased fusogenicity and stability which can be explained by a decrease in a
premature shedding of the S1 domain.49 The cryo-EM structure revealed a stable closed mutant
conformation, suggesting that D614G/N mutations

can attenuate the repulsive charge

interactions at the interface between S1 and S2 providing tighter packing of the head domains
against S2.49

Nonetheless, a consensus view on the exact mechanism underlying the functional effects and
increased infectivity of

S-D614G spike mutant is yet to be established,

owing to often

conflicting experimental evidence and the proposed mutually exclusive scenarios underpinning
molecular consequences of the D614G mutation on structure, dynamics and energetics of virus
entry.42

The recent illumining review highlighted several prevalent mechanisms

actively

debated in the field offered to explain diverse experimental data, including D614G-induced
modulation of cleavage efficiency of S protein; “openness” scenario advocating mutationinduced shift to the open states favorable for RBD-ACE2 interaction; “density” hypothesis
suggesting a more efficient S incorporation into the virion; and “stability” mechanism

that

implicates mutation-induced enhancement in the association and stability of prefusion spike
trimers as a driving force of greater infectivity.42
The growing body of computational modeling studies investigating dynamics and molecular
mechanisms of S-D614G mutational variant produced interesting but often inconsistent data that
fit different mechanisms. The development of a more unified view and a working theoretical
model which can explain the diverse experimental observations is an important focal point of
the current work. Several studies suggested that the D614G mutation may affect the intraprotomer energetics and favor

“1-up” open conformation by eliciting specific interaction

changes in the CTD1 and FP regions.50,51 Microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations recently probed the effects of the D614G mutation, suggesting that mutational
variant favors an open conformation in which S-G614 protein maintains the symmetry in the
number of persistent contacts between the three protomers.50 By applying a differential contact
analysis, this study argue that contacts in CTD1-CTD2 (528-685) and FP-FPPR (816-911)
regions may be responsible for conformational shift of the S-G614 mutant towards a partially

characterized the dynamics of

and

the S protein and

mutational variants, predicting the increase in the open state occupancy for the more infectious
D614G mutation due to

the increased

flexibility of the closed state and

the enhanced

rigidification of the open spike form.52 Computer-based mutagenesis and energy analysis of the
thermodynamic stability of the S-D614 and S-G614 proteins in the closed and partially open
conformations showed that local interactions near D614 position are energetically frustrated and
may create an unfavorable environment that is stabilized in the S-G614 mutant through
strengthening of the inter-protomer association between S1 and S2 regions.53 Using timeindependent component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network,

another

computational study identified the hotspot residues that may exhibit long-distance coupling
with the RBD opening, showing that the D614G could exert allosteric effect on the flexibility
of the RBD regions.54 Structure-based physical model showed that the D614G mutation may
induce a packing defect in S1 that promotes closer association and stronger interactions with S2
subunit, thereby supporting the reduced shedding hypothesis.55 Computational modeling and MD
simulations have been instrumental in predicting dynamics and function of SARS-CoV-2
glycoproteins.56-64 Our recent study examined molecular basis of the SARS-CoV-2 binding
with ACE2 enzyme showing that coevolution and conformational dynamics conspire to drive
cooperative binding interactions and signal transmission.62 Using protein contact networks and
perturbation response scanning

allosteric sites on the SARS-CoV- 2 spike protein were

proposed.63 Molecular simulations and network modeling approaches were used on our most
recent investigation to present evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can function as an
allosteric regulatory engine that fluctuates between dynamically distinct functional states.64

In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms
underlying the functional effects of the D614G mutation in different states of the SARS-CoV-2 S
protein.

We combined coarse-grained (CG) simulations and atomistic reconstruction of

dynamics trajectories with dynamic fluctuation communication analysis, modeling of the residue
interaction networks and network community analysis to simulate cryo-EM structures of the
SARS-CoV-2 D614 and G614 proteins corresponding to the S-RRAR and S-GSAS furincleavage deficient constructs. We quantify the effect of mutations on

functional dynamics and

stability of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins and demonstrate that D614 site may anchor a key
regulatory hinge cluster that dictates functional transitions between open and closed states.
Through

communication analysis

of

the atomistic conformational

ensembles, we probe allosteric communication residue preferences in the S-D614 and S-G614
proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can favor open state to restore allosteric
signaling function of the spike engine. By employing network-based community analysis as
proxy for characterization of protein stability and allosteric interactions, we show that the
D614G mutation can partially rearrange the network organization and promote the larger
number of stable communities in the open form by

enhancing the S1-S2 inter-domain

interactions. This study provides a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the
effect of D614G mutation by examining SARS-CoV-2 S protein as an allosteric regulatory
machine. The results support the reduced shedding hypothesis of the D614G mutant function
suggesting that mutation can have a moderate effect on local dynamics and interactions, while
exerting its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and
communications in the residue interaction networks.

Materials and Methods
Coarse-Grained Simulations and Elastic Models
We employed coarse-grained (CG) CABS model65-71

for simulations of

the

cryo-EM

structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S D614 and D614G mutant ectodomains with the native K986
and V987 residues. More specifically CG-CABS simulations were performed for the cryoEM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/D614 in the closed-all down state (pdb id 7KDG), SGSAS/D614 in the 1 RBD-up open state (pdb id 7KDH), SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/G614
mutant ectodomain in the closed form (pdb id 7KDK), SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/G614 mutant
in the 1 RBD-up open state (pdb id 7KDL) as well as
mutant S-RRAR/G614

furin cleaved SARS-CoV-2 spike

in the closed form (pdb id 7KDI) and 1 RBD-up open state (pdb id

7KDJ) (Table 1, Figure 1). In the CG-CABS model, the amino acid residues are represented
by Cα, Cβ, the center of mass of side chains and another pseudoatom placed in the center of
the Cα-Cα pseudo-bond.65-67 We employed CABS-flex approach that efficiently combines a
high-resolution coarse-grained model and efficient search protocol

capable of accurately

reproducing all-atom MD simulation trajectories and dynamic profiles of large biomolecules
on a long time scale.69-71 The sampling scheme of the CABS model used in our study is based
on

Monte Carlo replica-exchange dynamics and involves a sequence of local moves of

individual amino acids in the protein structure as well as moves of small fragments.65-67

elements. A total of 1,000 independent CG-CABS simulations were performed for each of the
studied systems. In each simulation, the total number of cycles was set to 10,000 and the
number of cycles between trajectory frames was 100.
All structures were obtained from the Protein Data Bank.72,73 Protein residues in the cryo-EM
structures were inspected for missing residues and protons that were initially added and
assigned according to the WHATIF program web interface.74,75 The structures were further
parsed through the Protein Preparation Wizard (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY) and were
subjected to the check of bond order, assignment and adjustment of ionization states, removal
of crystallographic water molecules and co-factors, capping of the termini, assignment of
partial charges, and addition of possible missing atoms and side chains that were not assigned
in the initial processing with the WHATIF program.

The missing loops in the RBD regions (residues 445-446,469-488) were reconstructed by
template-based modeling using the cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 in the presence of the
neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 complexed with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (pdb id

cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were

reconstructed and optimized using

template-based loop prediction approaches ModLoop,76 ArchPRED server77

and further

confirmed by FALC (Fragment Assembly and Loop Closure) program.78 The side chain
rotamers were refined and optimized by SCWRL4 tool.79 The conformational ensembles
were also subjected to all-atom reconstruction using PULCHRA method80 and CG2AA tool81
to produce atomistic models of simulation trajectories. The protein structures were then
optimized using atomic-level energy minimization with a composite physics and knowledgebased force fields as implemented in the 3Drefine method.82.

The atomistic structures from

simulation trajectories were further elaborated by adding N-acetyl glycosamine (NAG) glycan
residues and optimized.

The glycosylated microenvironment for atomistic models of the

Principal component analysis (PCA) of simulation trajectories was done using elastic network
models (ENM) analysis.83 Two elastic network models: Gaussian network model (GNM)83-85
and Anisotropic network model (ANM) approaches86 were used to compute the amplitudes of
isotropic thermal motions and directionality of anisotropic motions. The functional dynamics
analysis was conducted using the GNM in which protein structure is reduced to a network of N
residue nodes identified by Cα atoms and the fluctuations of each node are assumed to be
isotropic and Gaussian. Conformational mobility profiles in the essential space of low frequency
modes were obtained using DynOmics server85 and ANM server.86
Mutational Sensitivity Analysis and Alanine Scanning
To compute protein stability changes

in the SARS-CoV-2 S structures, we

conducted a

systematic alanine scanning of protein residues in the SARS-CoV-2 trimer mutants as well as
mutational sensitivity analysis at the mutational site for both SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and SARSCoV-2 S-G614 structures. Two different approaches were used. Alanine scanning of protein
residues was performed using FoldX approach.87-90 and BeAtMuSiC approach.91-93 If a free
energy change between a mutant and the wild type (WT) proteins ΔΔG= ΔG (MT)-ΔG (WT) >
0, the mutation is destabilizing, while when ΔΔG <0 the respective mutation is stabilizing.
BeAtMuSiC approach is based on statistical potentials describing the pairwise inter-residue
distances, backbone torsion angles and solvent accessibilities, and

considers the effect of the

mutation on the strength of the interactions at the interface and on the overall stability of the
complex.91-93

We leveraged rapid calculations

based on statistical potentials to compute the

ensemble-averaged alanine scanning computations and mutational sensitivity analysis at D614
and G614 positions using equilibrium samples from reconstructed simulation trajectories.

Distance Fluctuations Analysis of Protein Stability and Allosteric Propensities
Using a protein mechanics-based approach94-97 we probed residue stability and communication
propensities with the aid of distance fluctuation analysis of the simulation trajectories for the
studied SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The fluctuations of the mean distance between a given residue
and all other residues in the ensemble were converted into distance fluctuation stability and
communication indexes that measure the energy cost of
simulations.

adapted this metric to

characterize allosteric communication propensities of protein residues through their mechanical
properties since mean square deformations of a given residue with respect to the rest of the
protein are related to the inter-residue communication strength.
We computed the fluctuations of the mean distance between each atom within a given residue
and the atoms that belong to the remaining residues of the protein. The high values of distance
fluctuation indexes are associated with residues that display small fluctuations in their distances
to all other residues, while small values of this stability parameter would point to more flexible
sites that experience large deviations of their inter-residue distances. In our model, the distance
fluctuation stability index for each residue is calculated by averaging the distances between the
residues over the simulation trajectory using the following expression:

j*

is

the average distance from residue i to all other atoms j in the protein (the sum over j* implies
the exclusion of the atoms that belong to the residue i ). The interactions between the Cα atom
of residue i and the Cα atom of the neighboring residues i -1 and i +1 are excluded in the
calculation since the corresponding distances are nearly constant.

The inverse of these

fluctuations yields an effective force constant ki that describes the ease of moving an atom with

Dynamic-Based Modeling of Residue Interaction Network and Community Analysis
A graph-based representation of protein structures102,103 is used to represent residues as network
nodes and the inter-residue edges to describe residue interactions. The details of network
construction were described

in our previous studies.104,105

We

constructed the residue

interaction networks using both dynamic correlations103 and coevolutionary residue couplings99
that provide complementary descriptions of the allosteric interactions and yield robust network
signatures of long-range couplings and communications. The ensemble of shortest paths is
determined from matrix of communication distances by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.106
Network graph calculations were performed using the python package NetworkX.107
Using the constructed protein structure networks, we computed the residue-based betweenness
parameter. The short path betweenness centrality of residue i is defined to be the sum of the
fraction of shortest paths between all pairs of residues that pass through residue i :

The Girvan-Newman algorithm108-110 is used to identify local communities. An improvement of
Girvan-Newman method was implemented where all highest betweenness edges are removed
at each step of the protocol. The algorithmic details of this modified scheme were presented in
our recent study.111,112

The network parameters were computed using the python package

NetworkX107 and Cytoscape package for network analysis.113,114 A community-based analysis
and modularity assessment of allosteric interaction networks is based on the notion that groups
of residues that form local interacting communities are expected to be highly correlated and can
switch their conformational states cooperatively. As a result, long-range allosteric interaction
signals can be transmitted through a hierarchical chain of local communities on the dynamic
interaction networks.

The community analysis and

a

comparative

evaluation of the

communities in the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and S-G614 structures are used as proxy for
measuring

global protein stability and communication efficiency in performing allosteric

functions. This analysis provides also a global metric to measure changes in connectivity and
interaction between

subdomains and inter-protomer association in the SARS-CoV-2 S

structures.115

Results and Discussion
Conformational Mobility and Functional Dynamics Profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
Proteins: The D614G Mutation Induces Subtle Perturbations of Collective Motions
We employed multiple CG-CABS simulations followed by atomistic reconstruction and
refinement to provide a comparative analysis of the dynamic landscapes characteristic of the
major functional states of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer. While all-atom MD simulations with the
explicit

inclusion of the

glycosylation shield

could provide a rigorous assessment of

conformational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, such direct simulations remain to be
technically challenging and computationally demanding due to the gigantic size of a complete
SARS-CoV-2 S system embedded onto the membrane.56-59

To partially overcome these

computational challenges, we combined CG-CABS simulations with atomistic reconstruction
and additional optimization by adding the glycosylated microenvironment for 22 most occupied
N-glycan sites as described in Materials and Methods.
Using CABS-CG simulations, we examined how the D614G mutation could affect the
interdomain contacts and global dynamic profiles of the closed and partially open states (Figure
2). The presented analysis characterized the intrinsic dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins
in the native and D614G mutant states, particularly probing the

propensity of the S-D614G

mutant protein for altering dynamic signatures and facilitating movements towards the open
conformation.

The conformational dynamics profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/D614

(Figure 2A,B) and SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/G614 (Figure 2C,D) showed

a more flexible S1

subunit and very stable S2 subunit in both closed and 1-up open states. As expected, the
thermal fluctuations of both S1 and S2 regions were smaller in the closed state with RMSF <
1.0 Å.

mutant in the open form (pdb id 7KDJ). The profiles for protomer chains A,B and C are shown

In the closed state, the RBD (residues 331-528) and CTD1 (residues 528-591) corresponded to
the most stable regions in the S1 subunit, while UH (residues 736-781) and CH (residues 9861035) were the most stable regions in the S2 subunit (Figure 2A).

Only marginally larger

fluctuations were seen in the CTD2 region (residues 592-686) that connects S1 and S2 subunits.
Our analysis showed that the conformational dynamics profiles were generally similar for the
closed forms of both the SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/D614 (Figure 2A) and S-GSAS/G614 mutant
(Figure 2C). Molecular simulations did not detect any radical changes in the dynamics profile of
the D614G mutant, indicating that the effect of mutation on the conformational dynamics could
be subtle and amount to a number of small local changes dispersed throughout the protein
structure.

This suggests that a more detailed and granular analysis of the residue interaction

networks can be warranted to systematically explore and quantify the residue-based changes in
protein stability. CABS-CG dynamics revealed a moderate increase in the conformational
mobility of both D614 and D614G open states of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Figure 2B, D).
The single up protomer in both the S-D614 S-G614 forms can undergo larger fluctuations up
to RMSF =2.0-2.3 Å but the overall dynamic profile remained remarkably similar in the native
and mutant open forms. Of some notice were moderately greater residue displacements in the

NTD regions of the S-D614 and S-G614 open structures, including the NTDs of the two closeddown protomers (Figure 2B, D). Similar conformational dynamics profiles were obtained for the
S-RRAR/G414 structures in the closed and open states (Figure 2E, F). Several previous studies
suggested that the molecular basis of the increased infectivity for the D614G mutant may be
explained via “openness” hypothesis50-52 according to which D614G modification can alter
conformational dynamics signatures of the S protein and promote switching to the open
conformation, positioning a single or multiple RBDs to make contacts with the ACE2 receptor.
Our results showed no evidence of substantial alteration of the dynamic signatures caused by the
D614G mutation, showing similar conformational mobility profiles for the open states of the SD614 and S-G614 proteins.
To provide a more detailed analysis of the intra- and inter-protomer contacts in the closed and
open states, we computed the ensemble-averaged numbers of these contacts for the SARSCoV-2 S-GSAS/D614

and SARS-CoV-2 S-GSAS/G614 structures (Tables S1-S6) using a

contacts-based Prodigy approach for prediction of binding affinity in protein–protein complexes
and distance threshold of 5.5 Å to define an inter-molecular contact .116,117 This analysis showed
that the number of inter-protomer contacts is consistently greater in the closed state of the SD614 and S-G614

proteins as compared to

the partially open state.

According to this

assessment, D614 and Q613 residues can anchor the intra-protomer clusters with V597, S596
and T315 of the same protomer, while establishing contacts with T859, L861 and S735 residues
of the adjacent protomers (Figure 1, Tables S1-S6). It is worth noting that in agreement with
several computational studies advocating for the “openness” mechanism50

we also found a

preferentially symmetric nature of the inter-protomer contacts in the closed state, while the
number of inter-protomer contacts can be considerably reduced in the partially open form of S-

D614 conformation (Tables S1,S2). These changes could become less pronounced in the SG614 form, but the total number of the inter-protomer contacts is consistently reduced in the
open state regardless of the mutational status of D614 position (Tables S3-S6). A close
inspection of the local dynamics profiles

revealed only minor flexibility changes near the

mutational site, where the loss of favorable interactions with T859 of the adjacent protomer
may be compensated through the intra-protomer contacts especially for the up protomer in the
open state (Figure 2). It was proposed that a more flexible closed state would favor the opening
of

the S-D614 spike protein, while a more rigid open state of D614G would shift the

conformational equilibrium towards the open state.52 Our results revealed

small and largely

synchronous dynamic changes in the closed and open forms of the D614G mutant, showing no
indication of a dramatic alteration of the dynamic signatures to suggest an obvious trigger for
the dynamic preferences of the D614G mutant towards partially open form as was proposed in a
computational study.52 Based on these preliminary results, we suggested a hypothesis that the
D614G substitution may cause a cascade of small and subtle changes in both the intra- and
inter-protomer interactions

that may be difficult to directly discern from conformational

dynamics analysis. Consequently, a more rigorous analysis of collective motions and dynamic
characterization of rearrangements in the residue interaction networks for the S-D614 and SG614 proteins could be warranted to provide a more quantitative insight into the mechanism.
The experimental studies indicated that

the D614G mutational site is located in the

immobilized structural region of the SD2 domain where local environment of D614
combined with β strand formed by residues 311–319 may correspond to a hinge center
governing motions of NTD and RBD, as well as isolating the motions in S1 from the S2
subunit.44 To identify hinge sites and characterize collective motions in the SARS-CoV-2 S-

D614 and SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 structures, we performed PCA of trajectories derived from
CABS-CG simulations and also determined the essential slow modes using ENM analysis.85,86
The reported ENM-based functional dynamics profiles were averaged over the first three major
low frequency modes (Figure 3A,B). The conserved hinge regions

in the closed and open

forms of the S-D614 protein that can regulate the inter-domain movements between RBD and
NTD as well as the relative motions of S1 and S2 regions are localized at F318, S591, F592,
V539, L570, I572 and Y855 residues (Figure 3C,D). Strikingly, these sites are located in the
close proximity of the Q613 and D614 residues and could form several interaction clusters in
both the closed and open states of the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and SARS-CoV-2 S-G614
structures (Figure 3C,D).

Notably, L570, I572, Y855, I856, and S591 hinge residues are

situated near the inter-domain SD1-S2 interfaces and could act collectively as regulatory
switch centers governing the population shifts between closed and open forms. The central
finding of this analysis is the unique role that D614 and Q613 sites could play in anchoring and
integrating major hinge residues in regulatory interacting centers that may coordinate global
motions in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and govern allosteric structural changes between the
closed and open forms (Figure3). The shape of the essential mode profiles is mainly determined
by the topology of the protein fold and remained conserved between the closed forms of SGSAS/D614 structure (Figure 3A) and S-GSAS/G614 structure (Figure 4A), highlighting the
key role of these hinge clusters in modulating NTD/RBD displacements and functional motions
of the S1 subunit with respect to the largely immobilized S2 subunit. The slow mode shapes in
the closed forms of S-GSAS/D614 and S-GSAS/G614 reflected a general symmetrical nature
of the closed S trimer as the essential mobility profiles are largely identical for all protomers
showing minor movements of the RBD regions and moderate displacements of the NTDs.

Interestingly, the functional dynamics of the closed form for the cleaved S-RRAR/G614 mutant
structure

revealed breaking of symmetry between protomers, showing the larger and

asynchronous displacements of the NTD and RBD regions for two protomers

while

highlighting a partial immobilization of the S1-RBD and S2 regions for the third protomer
(Figure 4C). This observation indicated that the D614G mutant may perturb hinge clusters and
alter functional movements in the closed S-RRARS trimer, potentially priming protomers in
the S protein for transition to the open form.

These findings showed an agreement with

previous studies suggesting the increase in the open state preferences for the D614G mutation
due to the increased flexibility of the closed state and the enhanced rigidification of the open
form.52 Indeed, while local conformational mobility profiles are similar for the native S-D614
and mutant S-G614 proteins, the subtle differences may emerge in the functional dynamics
patterns that pointed to the increased global mobility of the S1 regions in the closed state.
Accordingly, the D614G mutation may partly destabilize collective motions in the closed form
and consequently alter the stability of the residue interaction networks in the S-RRARS trimer.
The significance of these observations stems from the fact that local structural and interaction
changes near the D614 position could modulate stability of key hinge clusters and thereby
incur a significant effect on functional dynamics and allosteric transitions between closed and
open forms. At the same time, we observed that slow mode profiles for the open form in the SGSAS/D614 (Figure 3B), S-GSAS/G614 (Figure 4B) and S-RRAR/G614 mutants (Figure 4D)
are similar, featuring movements of the single RBD-up protomer and moderate displacements
of the NTD regions.

Hence, we conclude D614G mutation may exert its dynamic effect

through preferential modulation of collective movements in the closed form and promoting
transition to the open forms rather than altering dynamic signatures of the open spike states.

Mutational Sensitivity Analysis in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimers Reveal D614G-Induced
Differential Stabilization of the Closed and Open States
Previous mutagenesis analysis suggested that the D614G mutant may improve the stability of
the S protein by strengthening the inter-protomer association between S1 and S2 regions.53 We
employed the equilibrium ensembles generated by CABS-CG simulations of the SARS-CoVstructures to perform alanine scanning of the protein residues and mutational sensitivity analysis
of the S-D614 and S-G614 proteins at the mutational site (Figure 5). The primary objective of
this energetic analysis was to further test the shedding hypothesis suggesting that D614G may
lead to stabilization of

the S protein and block a premature dissociation of the S1 subunit,

leading to the increased number of functional spikes and stronger infectivity.48 The important
questions addressed in this analysis are (a) whether the D614G mutation can incur a similar or
differential effect on the closed and open forms of the S protein and (b) if there are differences
in the D614G-induced energetic effects in the S-GSAS and S-RRAR structures.
Through FoldX-based alanine profiling of the protein residues in the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and
S-G614 structures, we probed the hypothesis that hinge centers may correspond to the energetic
hotspots. We also examined and highlighted stability of the residues involved in the interprotomer contacts. The alanine scanning across the studied SARS-CoV-2 S structures revealed
the presence of multiple energetic hotspots that are broadly distributed and generally are
organized into local clusters (Figure 5). As may be expected, the majority of the energetic
hotspot clusters were observed near the positions involved in both the intra- and inter-protomer
contacts, including the RBD residues and CTD1 domain (residues 529-591).

Most of the

energetic hotspot clusters are localized in the rigid S2 subunit regions, including the UH regions
(residues 736-781), HR1 (residues 910-985), and CH regions (residues 986-1035).

Notably, a number of the energetic hotspots were aligned with hinge positions F318, S591,
F592, L570, I572, F759, and I788 where alanine mutations produced considerable destabilization
changes ( >3 kcal/mol). To gain a more detailed characterization of mutational sensitivity at
the D614 position, we conducted a full scanning profile of the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and SARSCoV-2 S-G614 structures in both closed and open states (Figure 5C,D). Interestingly, the
mutational sensitivity profile of the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 in the closed form showed moderate
stabilization changes for majority of substitutions except D614E and D614K (Figure 5C).
Interestingly, the D614C, D614G, and D614N mutations result in an appreciable and similar
stabilization of the closed form. More considerable stabilization changes of ~1.2 kcal/mol
were induced by the D614G mutation in the open form (Figure 5D). Notably, the D614G
mutation caused the largest energetic change as compared to other substitutions. Interestingly,
we also observed that

the D614G and D614N mutations could lead to the favorable and

comparable stabilization changes in both the closed and open forms of the S-GSAS/D614
protein (Figure 5C,D).

These findings are consistent with the latest differential scanning

fluorimetry studies showing that the D614G and D614N induced changes have a very similar
effect, leading to a considerable improvement of thermal stability which may be explained by a
decrease in premature shedding of S1 domain.49
In line with these findings, mutational sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 G614 structures
revealed a significant destabilization effect of substitutions in both the closed and open forms
(Figure 6). The results particularly highlighted the largest changes induced by the G614D and
G614E modifications in the closed (Figure 6A,C) and open forms (Figure 6B,D). Of interest is
the fact that destablization changes induced by the G614D and G614E modifications become
more pronounced in the S-RRAR/G614 structures (Figure 6C,D)

Hence, our data suggested that the local energetic gains caused by D614G can cause stabilization
of the S trimer and stronger interactions between S1 and S2 domains that could also manifest in
the improved communications in the residue interaction networks in the mutant variant. These
results also offer support to the experimental observations that the enhanced stability of the SD614G mutant may be linked with the mechanism of the reduced S1 shedding.49 Importantly,
the differential stabilization of the S-G614 closed and open forms showing the energetic
preferences of the mutant towards the open state may help to partly reconcile the “openness”
and “S1-shedding” mechanism underpinning the D614G effects.

structural stability and allosteric communication propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 native and
D614G mutant forms. The residue-based distance fluctuation indexes measure the energy cost
of

the dynamic residue deformations and could serve as a robust metric for assessment of

stability and allosteric propensities of protein residues.98,99 Structural rigidity of functionally
important regions may be reflected in their high fluctuation indexes associated with small
fluctuations in the average inter-residue distances. In this model, dynamically correlated residues
whose effective distances fluctuate with low or moderate intensity are expected to communicate
with the higher efficiency than the residues that experience large fluctuations. According to our
studies98,99

the residues with high

distance fluctuation indexes may also correspond

to

structurally stable regulatory positions implicated in coordination of allosteric communication,
and abrupt changes between maxima and minima in the profile

may point to boundaries

between structurally rigid and flexible regions signaling presence of the inter-domain hinge sites.

By using this analysis, we identified allosteric hotspots that are responsible for modulation
of

stability and allosteric changes.

The distance fluctuation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 S-

D614 closed form featured a number of high peaks that were distributed in the S1 and S2
subunits (Figure 7A). In particular, a strong peak

was seen in the S1-RBD region (residues

312-320) that corresponds to the key component of the regulatory hinge site and located in the
close structural proximity of the D614 position. Notably, the largest peak was aligned with
cluster of residues anchored by the Q613/D614 sites that also included S596, V597 and I598
positions (Figure 7A).

Other notable peaks corresponded to residues in the S2

regions

including cluster 948-LQDVV-952 in the HR1 region (residues 910-985). According to our
latest study of the SARS-CoV-2 S mutant trimers, this hydrophobic center is coupled with the
Y855/I856 conformational switch that mediate couplings between the S2 subunit and the RBD
regions.118 Interestingly, the HR1 region (residues 934-940) is also known to be targeted by
naturally occurring mutations in SARS-CoV-2 protein.119,120
In the open state of the S-D614 spike protein, we observed notable changes in the distance
fluctuation profile, particularly indicating the loss of appreciable peaks near the D614 cluster
(Figure 7B).

Structural mapping of the distance fluctuation profiles further highlighted these

changes (Figure 8A,B). Indeed, the density of communication hotspots markedly changed in the
open form of S-D614, featuring clusters in the S1 regions but revealing a conspicuous lack of
the communication hotspots near the S1-S2 inter-domain regions (Figure 8B). Accordingly,
based on this model, the allosteric interaction network in the native S-D614 protein may be
stronger in the closed form than in the partially open state. Consistent with the energetic
analysis, we observed that the distribution seen in the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 closed form
(Figure 7A) can be partially altered in the S-G614 closed states (Figure 7C,E).

Indeed, in the closed form of the D614G mutant strong peaks remained in the S1-RBD hinge
region (residues 312-320) and

near the D614G local cluster, while the density of hotspots in

the S2 regions was weakened. Structural mapping illustrated these subtle adjustments (Figure
8A,C), pointing to the increased consolidation of communication hotspots near S1-S2 interface
in the S-G614 mutant. These observations suggested that allosteric couplings between S1 and
S2 subunits may be partly reorganized in the S-G614 mutant

to strengthen stability and

communication at the S1-S2 interface. Of special importance are the distribution profiles of the
SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 mutant in the open state featuring multiple pronounced peaks in the S1
and S2 regions as well as at the S1-S2 interface (Figure 7D,F) Strikingly, the S-G614 mutant
profiles in the open state revealed a strong peak aligned almost precisely with the mutational site
(Figure 7D,F). This suggested that the D614G mutation may strengthen the stability and
enhance allosteric communication propensities in this region, which could arguably lead to the
stronger S1-S2 inter-domain associations and the improved allosteric signaling in the open
state. Structural analysis of the distribution peaks (Figure 8D,F) also pointed to a preferential
consolidation of the S-G614 communication hotspots in the CTD1 and CTD1-CTD2 regions
(528-685). To summarize, the distribution of allosteric hotspots in the S-D614 and S-G614
mutant structures revealed a partial reorganization, showing minor changes between the closed
states but more significant alterations in the open states of the S-G614 mutant. The observed
reorganization and consolidation of the communication hotspots in the CTD1-CTD2 regions of
the S-G614 mutant may promote the greater stability and efficient allosteric couplings between
S1 and S2 regions. We argue that

D614G mutation-induced modulation of

stability and

allosteric propensities could therefore limit S1 shedding and favor acquisition of the open state
to restore and further optimize allosteric signaling of the SARS-CoV-2 S machinery.

Network Modeling and Community Analysis Suggest D614G-Induced Reorganization of
the Residue Interaction Networks and Improved Allosteric Signaling in the Open States
Mechanistic network-based models allow for a quantitative analysis of allosteric molecular
events in which conformational landscapes of protein systems can be remodeled by various
perturbations such as mutations, ligand binding, or interactions with other proteins. Using this
framework, the residue interaction networks in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer structures were
built using a graph-based representation of protein structures
interconnected

through

in which residue nodes are

both dynamic103 and coevolutionary correlations.99,104,105 Using

community decomposition, the residue interaction networks were divided into local interaction
modules in which residues are densely interconnected and highly correlated, while the local
communities are weakly coupled through long-range allosteric couplings. A community-based
model of allosteric communications is based on the notion that groups of residues that form
local interacting communities are correlated and switch their
cooperatively.

conformational states

Using network-centric description of residue interactions, we computed the

aggregate number of stable local communities and stable hubs in the closed and open forms of
the S-D614 and S-G614 mutants (Figure 9).
In this model, we explored the community analysis as a network proxy for stability assessment.
The number of communities for the S-D614 protein was greater in the closed form (Figure 9A).
In some contrast, the network analysis of the S-G614 mutant showed a subtle redistribution in
the number and allocation of communities as the open state of the mutant harbored more
communities and this difference was more pronounced in the S-RRAR/G614 mutant (Figure
9A). Interestingly, the total number of

local communities is moderately increased in both

closed and open states of the S-G614 mutant. In network terms, this indicated the increased

stability of the residue interaction networks in the mutant structures (Figure 9). These results
are consistent with the latest experimental data that demonstrated the improved stability of the
D614G mutant as compared to the S-D614 protein

allowing for reduction in a premature

shedding of S1 domain.49 A more detailed inspection of local communities in the closed and
partially open conformational states of the native S-D614 protein provided some important
insight into the proposed mechanisms. We found

that not only the total number of local

communities is greater in the closed S-D614 state, but also there are important changes in the
communities situated in the RBD-CTD1, RBD-CTD2 and CTD1-CTD2 regions (Figure 9A-C).
The local modules in these regions that are unique to the closed form included Q314-S596Q613, I693-V656-Y660, F543-L598-V576 and I666-L650-I670-T645 clusters (Supporting
Information, Table S7). In the partially open form, the state-specific communities in these
regions included

P579-P330-N544, F541-L552-I587 and R328-F543-P579 (Supporting

Information, Table S7).

Structural mapping of

local communities in the S-D614 states

illustrated subtle differences in the distribution and density of stable modules (Figure 9B,C).
Characteristically, the key community in the closed form of the S-D614 protein is anchored by
Q613, which is the immediate neighbor of D614, forming a tight stable cluster with Q314 in the
NTD and S596 in CTD2 (Figure 9B,C). A general comparison of structural maps indicated the
better connectivity of local communities in the closed form of S-D614 forming a broad network
linking the S2 regions with the NTD and RBD regions (Figure 9B). In addition, a number of
unique communities are localized in the CTD2 region (I693-V656-Y660 and I666-L650-I670T645), suggesting the stronger S1-S2 interfacial interactions and tighter packing between S1 and
S2 domains in the closed form of the S-D614 protein.

Notably, we also detected the larger number of communities in the NTD and RBD S1 regions in
the closed form, indicating that the allosteric interaction network in the S1 and S1-S2 regions is
stronger in the closed form, ensuring efficient signaling between S1 and S2 regions in protecting
all-down closed form in the S-D614 protein. A somewhat weaker inter-connectivity of local
communities near S1-S2 interfaces and in the NTD/RBD regions was observed in the open state
of S-D614.

These findings suggested that the stability and efficiency of allosteric

communication in the residue interaction network could favor the closed-down form of the SD614 spike protein. Importantly, the community analysis revealed the increased number of
stable modules for the S-G614 mutant in both closed and open forms (Figure 9A, Supporting
Information, Tables S9,S10). Both forms of S-G614 mutant featured the appreciable number of
communities in the CTD1 and CTD2 regions involved in stabilization of the S1-S2 interfaces
(Figure 9D,E).

These inter-domain local communities bridging S1 and S2 regions included

T315-T299-V597, R328-S530-Q580, Q314-S596-Q613, I664-I312-I598, L611-P6645-L650, and
F898-F802-F797. The stabilizing communities in the S1-S2 interfaces appeared to strengthen
stability of both closed and open S-G614 forms which is consistent with the experimentally
observed increased in protein stability of the D614G mutant.49 However, the balance in the
number of communities may be shifted towards the open state of the S-G614 mutant, showing

a more significant increase of local stable modules and promoting the preferential stabilization
of the open mutant form.

The key community near mutational site Q314-S596-Q613 is

uniquely present only in the open form of the S-G614 mutant, likely pointing to state-specific
rearrangements of stable interactions induced by the D614G mutation. The important subtle
rearrangements were found in the local communities localized in the N2R linker region (residues
306–334) that connects the NTD and RBD regions stacking against the CTD1 and CTD2
domains. In the favorable closed form of S-D614 protein, these modules include I326-V534V539, R328-L533-D578, R328-S530-Q580, T299-T315-V597 and Q314-S596-Q613 (Figure
9B). Interestingly, the open form of the S-G614 mutant featured some of these modules (T299T315-V597 and Q314-S596-Q613) and several additional N2R communities unique to this state
(R328-F543-P579, P579-P330-N543, F338-F342-L368) that strengthen connections of the N2R
linker with the NTD and RBD regions. This local subnetwork may be instrumental in bridging
the individual domains in the S1 subunit and ensure a more efficient inter-connectivity between
S2 regions, N2R and S1-RBD regions in the S-G614 mutant. The observed difference in the
total number of local modules favoring the open mutant state is largely due emerging
communities in the NTD and RBD regions (Figure 9D,E). Indeed, while the open form of the SD614 spike protein is characterized by mobile NTDs that could provide flexible access to the
ACE2 receptor, the increased stabilization of the NTD and RBD regions in the S-G614 mutant
may accompany strengthening of the S1-S2 interdomain interactions and could contribute to a
decrease in premature shedding of S1 domain. Hence, D614G mutation may also exert allosteric
effect by partly immobilizing the distal NTD and RBD regions. These findings support the
previously suggested notion that the D614G mutation in the SD2 domain could allosterically

strengthen stability of the distal NTD and RBD regions in the open state44,45 and therefore
potentially promote exposure to the host receptor and greater infectivity.
These findings provide an interesting explanation supporting the reduced shedding hypothesis.
Indeed, it has

been previously speculated that the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions

between D614 in S1 and T859 in S2 caused by D614G mutation may promote rather than limit
shedding of the S1 domain.47

It was also indicated that D614-T859 protomer-protomer

hydrogen bonding may be of critical importance for the integrity and stability of the trimer, and
that the D614G mutation could weaken the interaction between the S1 and S2 units, facilitating
the shedding of S1

from membrane-bound S2.

Our results are more consistent with an

alternative explanation and latest experimental data46 by showing that the D614G mutation may
strengthen the stability

of the local community

Q314-S596-Q613 and promote hydrogen

bonding interactions between Q613 and T859 of adjacent protomer afforded by the local
backbone flexibility at the mutational site. The presented results also partly reconciled several
scenarios offered to explain functional effects of the D614G mutation. Indeed, the community
network analysis

suggested that preferential stabilization of the open mutant form can be

determined by two main factors : (a) through strengthening of the S1-S2 interactions and (b) by
reducing functional movements of the NTD and RBD regions exposed to binding with the host
receptor. Accordingly, the D614G mutation may exert its effect through allosteric stabilization
of the S1-S2 interfaces limiting shedding of the S1 domain and by reducing flexibility and
enhancing thermodynamic preferences of the open state that is central aspect of the “openness”based mechanistic scenario.

identifying hotspots of allosteric

The hub centers are instrumental in regulation of

allosteric couplings and signal transmission in the protein structure network and are often used to
characterize the inter-community connectivity and mediating centers of allosteric interaction
networks. The evaluation of the total number of state-specific hubs revealed a picture consistent
with the community analysis, showing that the number of unique hubs in the open forms of the
S-G614 mutant is moderately greater than in the closed mutant form (Figure 10A). Notably,
the closed and open forms of the S-D614 and S-G614 structures can share a number of
conserved hub positions that are largely determined by the topology of the spike trimer (Figure
10B,C). Interestingly, these common hubs are very similar to the conserved network hubs
reported for cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike S trimer in the closed state
(K986P/V987P,) (pdb id 6VXX) and open state (pdb id 6VYB).115 Indeed, among conserved
hub positions there are a number of residues proximal or directly aligned with the hinge sites
shared by closed and open forms including T315, F318, R319, R328, V539, F592, and Y612
located near the D614 mutational site (Figure 10B,C). Interestingly, several of these common
hubs (T315, F318, R319, and R328) belong to the functionally important for communication
N2R linker region (residues 306–334) that connects the NTD and RBD regions with the CTD1
and CTD2 domains. Structural maps of common hubs in the S-D614 and S-G614 proteins
showed that a significant number of these hotspots occupy conserved regions of the S2 subunit,
particularly UH region (residues 736-781), HR1 (residues 910-985), and CH (residues 9861035) (Figure 10B,C). This is consistent with structural and evolutional conservation of these
regions that remain largely preserved in their native positions in the prefusion conformations.

By projecting state-specific

hubs for the S-G614 mutant (Figure 10D,E)

the differences

between the closed and partially open states could be further highlighted, particularly showing
a consolidation of new hotspots and a stronger connectivity of these mediating centers near the
S1-S2 interface regions for the open form. Among unique hotspots that are specific for the
closed mutant state are CTD1 residues N544, F559, R567 and CTD2 residues Y695,Y674
whereas in the open mutant state a number of unique new hubs were detected in the CTD2
region (V597, Q675, Q690, and Q672). These new unique hubs at the S1-S2 interfacial regions
in combination with the common hubs in the N2R linker region (T315, F318, R319, and R328)
form a subnetwork that stabilizes connections between the NTD and RBD regions

and the

CTD1 and CTD2 domains. Similar to other network-centric analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 S
trimers115 we observed

some variance in the distribution of hubs in different protomers,

confirming that there are elements of the inherent asymmetry in the residue interaction networks
across subunits.
To conclude, dynamic network modeling and community analysis of the S-D614 and S-G614
proteins revealed that D614G mutation can induce a partial rearrangement of

the residue

interaction networks and promote the larger number of stable communities in both the closed
and open forms by enhancing the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions. Furthermore, the network
analysis suggested a differential stabilization of the S-G614 mutant, favoring the open form in
which strengthened allosteric couplings between mutational sites, S1-S2 regions and NTD/RBD
regions in S1 could contribute to a decrease in premature shedding of S1 domain. One of the
overarching objectives

of

our computational investigation is

to examine functional

mechanisms of D614G mutation from the point of view of allosteric regulation and reconcile
multiple conflicting scenarios underlying D614G effects.

growing body of experimental data, we suggested that an allosteric regulatory model may help
to explain how the D614G mutation exerts its effect. The proposed allosteric model of SARSCoV-2 S regulation and functions may be also useful to address questions concerning the effect
of mutations on evading antibody binding and immune resistance. Although recent studies
indicated that D614G variant did not itself drive escape from antibody binding, it was found
that D614G can remarkably potentiate escape mutations at some positions in certain patients,
supporting an allosteric mechanism of action triggered by this mutation on dynamics and
function in remote regions exposed to interactions with antibodies.121 In light of these newly
emerging experimental data, the proposed allosteric model of the D614G mechanism may
provide a feasible theoretical and modeling framework to examine the role of combinations of
mutations and further clarify the reasons underlying the increasing global dominance of the
D614G variant. Our results argue that the D614G mutation may exert its global impact on
other sites and amplify the effect of combined mutations by acting as an important mediating
center governing regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 allosteric machine. Targeting of the predicted
mediating centers of allosteric interactions and communication hubs in the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins with small molecules could also help to probe molecular mechanisms underlying
infectivity variants

while simultaneously facilitating discovery of novel variant-specific

allosteric modulators and inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 functions.
Conclusions
We combined several simulation-based approaches with dynamic network modeling and
community analysis to quantify the effect of D614G mutation on

dynamics, stability and

network organization of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. The results of this study provide a novel
insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of D614G mutation by examining

efficient allosteric couplings between S1 and S2 regions.

Using

mutational sensitivity analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 S-D614 and S-G614 proteins we showed that
D614G can improve stability of the spike protein, offering support to the reduced shedding
mechanism. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we also probed stability
and distribution of allosteric hotspots providing evidence that D614G mutation can favor the
open state to enhance allosteric signaling of the spike engine.
A more detailed network analysis and systematic characterization of stable local communities in
multiple states of the S-D614 and S-G614 proteins, we demonstrated that D614G mutation can
increase protein stability and strengthen the allosteric interaction networks in both closed and
open forms. The results indicated that D614G mutation-induced modulation of stability and
allosteric propensities could stabilize the open mutant state

by effectively restoring allosteric

signaling of the native closed state. This study provides support to the reduced shedding
hypothesis suggesting that D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically
induced changes on stability and long-range communications in the residue interaction networks.
We argue that considering functions of the SARS-CoV-2 pike proteins through the prism of an
allosterically regulated machine may prove to be useful in uncovering functional mechanisms
and rationalizing the growing body of

diverse experimental

data via allosteric models

underpinning signaling events. These models can ultimately link the allosteric mechanisms of
proteins to their functional role in regulatory processes and signaling events.122-124
