Abstract

42

Overshooting immune reactions can occur during inflammatory responses that accompany

43

severe infections, such as COVID-19. Cytokines, damage-associated molecular patterns

44

(DAMPs), and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can generate positive feedback loops of

45

inflammation, leading to long-term complications such as vascular endothelialitis,

46

thrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, neurological impairments, and chronic fatigue.

47

Dexamethasone can limit inflammation by inhibiting the activation of pro-inflammatory

48

transcription factors. High dose dexamethasone, however, has undesirable side effects.

49

Here, we show that Ceylon cinnamon and its major compound cinnamaldehyde can mitigate

50

inflammatory signaling in vitro. Cinnamaldehyde interferes with the dimerization of toll-like

51

receptor 4 (TLR4), which can be activated by DAMPs like HSP60 and HMGB1. Our results

52

suggest that supplementary treatment with Ceylon cinnamon may allow administration of

53

lower doses of dexamethasone to avoid high dose steroid side effects. Moreover,

54

preliminary results indicate that Ceylon cinnamon modulates angiogenesis, which is a

55

reactive phenomenon in COVID-19.

Introduction

58

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes an acute inflammatory response in organs

59

with frequent long-term effects. Ackermann et al. 2020 described massive pulmonary

60

vascular endothelialitis, thrombosis, and angiogenesis in COVID-19 patients (1). Long-term

61

complications include neurological disturbances, kidney and myocardial disorders, as well as

62

chronic fatigue (2-5). COVID-19 infection is also characterized by excessive immune

63

reactions, which are frequently referred to as the ‘cytokine storm’ (6, 7). Various cytokines

64

are involved in this overshooting immune reaction, including TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-

65

6, IL-8, and CRP (8-10). The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of

66

activated B cells (NF-κB, p50/p65) is also heavily involved in inflammatory processes (Fig.

1), regulating the expression of hundreds of inflammatory genes, including the pro-

68

inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF (11, 12), generating a positive feedback loop (Fig. 1).

69

Moreover, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like heat shock protein 60

70

(HSP60), high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and calprotectin (S100A8/A9 hetero tetramer)

71

can be released during immune reactions elicited by COVID-19 infection (13-16). These

72

DAMPs can activate pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2, TLR4, and RAGE (14, 16-

73

19) and generate additional positive feedback via NF-κB, as has been shown for TLR4 (Fig.

74

1), causing further cytokine release. Additionally, high amounts of reactive oxygen and

75

nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) are produced during inflammation (20). As we previously

76

reported, ROS/RNS can substantially potentiate the TLR4 stimulation potential of DAMPs in

77

vitro, suggesting that these species can probably further escalate inflammatory processes

78

(19, 21) (Fig.1).

Figure 1 Positive feedback loops amplifying the magnitude of inflammatory signaling.

81

Pro-inflammatory cytokines cause activation of NF-κB, which amplifies their production,

82

resulting in a positive cytokine feedback loop. In addition, DAMPs can be released and

83

activate NF-κB via TLR4 and other pattern recognition receptors, generating a further

84

feedback loop. Moreover, interactions with ROS/RNS can form chemically modified DAMPs

(mod-DAMPs) with enhanced TLR4-stimulating potential, additionally fueling inflammation.

86

Dexamethasone inhibits activation of NF-κB, whereas cinnamaldehyde, the major active

87

compound of ethanolic Ceylon cinnamon extract, inhibits activation of TLR4, thus disrupting

88

the feedback loops.

89
90

One of the clinical goals for the treatment of COVID-19 is to mitigate an excessive

91

inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid which

92

acts on NF-κB (22, 23) is an effective therapeutic intervention for moderate to severe

93

disease (4, 24), but it can cause unwanted side effects in high doses. TLR4 could be another

94

potential target for treatment of COVID-19 since it plays an important role in the DAMP-

95

driven positive feedback loops (Fig. 1). Cinnamaldehyde (CA), the major active compound of

96

Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) extract (CCE) (25-27) can inhibit the activation of

97

TLR4 by preventing receptor dimerization (28). As shown in an animal model, the concurrent

98

intake of Cinnamon can also mitigate the side effects of dexamethasone (29). We

99

hypothesized that Ceylon cinnamon or cinnamaldehyde might be well suited as a

100

supplementary treatment for COVID-19 to lower the risk of the ‘cytokine storm’ and allow

101

administration of reduced dosages of dexamethasone to mitigate steroid-induced side-

102

effects (30).

103

In this study, we compared CCE and CA with dexamethasone in the suppression of TLR4-

104

dependent cytokine mRNA production and IL-8 protein release in vitro. Further, we present

105

preliminary data showing that CCE inhibits tube formation, which serves as a cellular model

106

for angiogenesis.

107

We do not recommend the use of Cassia cinnamon or its extracts, due to its possibly high

108

content of liver-toxic coumarin (31).

Materials and Methods

110

Ceylon cinnamon extract and cinnamaldehyde

111

Ceylon cinnamon extract (CCE) was prepared by extraction from Ceylon cinnamon powder

112

(Cinnamomi ceylanici cortex, Caesar & Loretz GmbH, Hilden, Germany) with 70% ethanol

113

(Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) in a 1:5 ratio and incubation for 10

114

days at room temperature, protected from light and shaken once daily. After the incubation

115

period, the CCE was filtered through a 0.22-µM pore size PES membrane filter unit (Corning

116

Inc., Corning, USA) under sterile conditions and stored in brown glass bottles at room

117

temperature protected from light. In a previous study, a CCE concentration of 0.3% was

118

determined to be optimal for the treatment of THP-1 cells (26), with higher concentrations

119

resulting in cytotoxic effects; lower concentrations were, on the other hand, less potent in

120

preventing inflammation (26). CCE was diluted 1:10 in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered

121

Saline (DPBS -/-) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) and cells were treated with

122

final concentrations of 0.2% and 0.3% CCE.

123

A cinnamaldehyde (CA, Sigma-Aldrich) stock solution of 20 mg/mL was freshly prepared in

124

absolute ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). For cell culture experiments, we diluted the CA stock

125

solution in DPBS -/- to concentrations of 1 mM and 10 mM.

126

Dexamethasone

127

A dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich) stock solution (1 mg/mL in 70% ethanol) was freshly

128

prepared for each experiment. THP-1 cells were treated with final dexamethasone

129

concentrations of 3.2 µM and 6.4 µM according to Menacher et al., 2017 (32).

130

Cultivation and treatment of THP-1 monocytes

131

Cell culture experiments were performed with human THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cells

132

(ATCC, LGC Standards GmbH, Wesel, Germany). Cells were grown in Roswell Park

Scientific) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.

137

The THP-1 cells were seeded in 96-well V-bottom cell culture plates (Greiner Bio-One

138

GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 4x104 cells in 100 µL growth medium per

139

well and allowed to settle for 1 h. In duplicate, cinnamon extract or vehicle control (70%

140

ethanol) was added to the cells in final concentrations of 0.2% and 0.3%, and cells were pre-

141

incubated for 2 h. Cinnamaldehyde was added in concentrations ranging from 10 µM up to

142

70 µM, also including a vehicle control (100% ethanol), followed by pre-incubation in the

143

same way. After pre-incubation, TLR4 activation was stimulated by adding

144

lipopolysaccharide (LPS-EB from E. coli 0111:B4; InvivoGen, Toulouse, France) in a final

145

concentration of 50 ng/mL. Cells were incubated with LPS for 4 h. Supernatants were used

146

to determine IL-8 release using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; BD,

147

Heidelberg, Germany). Cell viability was determined following overnight incubation with

148

alamarBlue™ cell viability reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was added to the cells

149

in a concentration of 10%. After incubation, the fluorescence intensity was measured with a

150

Synergy™ NEO HTS multi-mode microplate reader (Biotek Instruments GmbH, Bad

151

Friedrichshall, Germany) using excitation and measurement wavelengths of 560 nm and

152

590 nm, respectively. Two independent experiments were performed.

153

For qPCR analysis, cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates at a density of 4x105

154

cells/mL and treated in triplicate with 0.3% cinnamon extract, 3.2 µM or 6.2 µM

155

dexamethasone, and CA in a range of 20 µM–50 µM plus vehicle control as described

156

above. LPS incubation was carried out for 1 h and 4 h. After incubation, cells were separated

157

from supernatants by centrifugation (500 x g, 5 min), lysed in RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit;

159

PCR. Two independent experiments were performed on different days.

160

IL-8 ELISA

161

Interleukin-8 secretion of treated THP-1 monocytes was quantified by the ELISA OptEIA™

162

Set for human interleukin-8 (BD) following the manufacturer’s protocol with optimized wash

163

buffer composition (50x dilution). The cell supernatants were diluted in a range of 1:2–1:20

164

and tested in triplicate. The absorbance wavelength of 450 nm and reference wavelength of

165

570 nm were determined on a Synergy NEO plate reader. Using Gen5 software (Biotek), the

166

reference wavelength values were subtracted from the absorbance wavelength values.

167

Based on measured standard values, a standard curve was constructed. IL-8 cytokine

168

production was calculated according to the standard curve and respective dilution factors.

169

Statistical analysis and corresponding graphs were generated with Prism 9 software

170

(GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).

171

RNA extraction and qPCR

172

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of IL1-β,

173

IL-8, and TNF. Extraction of total RNA from cells was performed using the RNeasy Mini Kit

174

(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified RNA was eluted with 30 µL

175

RNase-free water. Total RNA yield was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm,

176

280 nm, and 320 nm using Take3 Trio Micro-Volume Plates (Biotek) in combination with the

177

Synergy NEO plate reader. All samples were adjusted to an RNA concentration of 50 ng/µL.

185

thermal cycling protocol was used: 98 °C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s,

186

and 60 °C for 25 s. Data analysis was performed with CFX Manager software 3.1 (Bio-Rad)

187

using the 2−ΔΔCT method to calculate gene expression. For qPCR, all samples were tested in

188

technical duplicates and arithmetic mean and standard deviation values were calculated.

189

Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analysis.

190

Cultivation of HUVEC Cells

191

HUVEC cells (Lonza) were cultivated in endothelial cell medium (EGM-2; Lonza) containing

192

2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for rapid

193

proliferation. To analyze tube formation, the cells were first grown (seeding density 2 ×

194

104 cells/mL) in 6-well plates and then transferred to collagen-coated bottom plates without

195

basement membrane extract (CELLCOAT-coated; Biocompare, South San Francisco, CA,

196

USA). The cells were stained with Calcein-AM (#17783, Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) and

197

inspected with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) using excitation

198

and emission wavelengths of 496 nm and 520 nm.

199

Endothelial cell tube formation assay

200

A commercial assay system was used (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to

201

determine endothelial cell tube formation; the assay was performed as described in the

202

instructions from the manufacturer and following a published procedure(34). In this system,

203

HUVEC cells (from Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were cultivated in EGM-Plus Growth Medium

204

(with 5 mM glucose), containing supplements (35) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For the

205

experiments, cells at passage <11 were used. The matrix, formed from collagen/basement

206

membrane extract (Geltrex; Thermo Fisher Scientific), was layered into 12 well-plates

207

(Corning/Costar-Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). The dishes were overlaid with 1 ×

dexamethasone (Dex), or with various concentrations of cinnamaldehyde (CA). After 2 h,

221

cells were challenged or not with LPS in a final concentration of 50 ng/mL and incubated for

222

4 h. Thereafter, the alamarBlueTM assay was performed to determine cell viability. Arithmetic

223

mean values and standard deviations based on four measurement for each column; both

224

experiments were repeated with very similar results on different days.

225
226

To evaluate toxicity, an alamarBlueTM assay was performed to determine cell viability (Fig.

227

2). Ceylon cinnamon extracts at concentrations of 0.2% and 0.3% elicited no toxic effects in

228

THP-1 cells, which is in accordance with previous results (26). At concentrations of up to

229

40 µM, cinnamaldehyde showed no toxic effects in THP-1 monocytes, whereas

230

concentrations of CA of 50 µM and higher resulted in reduced cell viability. Dexamethasone

231

concentrations of 3.2 µM and 6.4 µM elicited no cytotoxic effects.

232
233

Expression of cytokine genes

234

We next tested the efficacy of CCE and CA in inhibiting IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF mRNA

235

expression and IL-8 protein release in THP-1 monocytes (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). In previous studies,

236

we determined that a concentration of 0.3% CCE is most effective in THP-1 cells (26, 27).

237

To confirm dose dependency, we also included a concentration of 0.2% CCE in the mRNA

238

expression experiments. For CA, we tested concentrations of 20 µM, 30 µM, 40 µM, and

239

50 µM CA. We compared CCE and CA with two concentrations of dexamethasone (3.2 µM

240

and 6.4 µM) as a reference standard anti-inflammatory drug.

CCE, different concentrations of CA or dexamethasone (3.2 µM and 6.4 µM) for 2 h. Then,

LPS (final conc. 50 ng/mL) was added and cells were incubated for a further 1 h or 4 h.

The mRNA expression of all tested NF-κB-regulated cytokines was strongly enhanced 1 h

253

after stimulation with 50 ng/mL LPS with sharp decreases in the induction by 4 h (Fig. 3).

254

The used ethanol concentrations had no impact on gene expression. Treatment with 0.3%

255

CCE drastically inhibited the LPS-stimulated increases in the mRNA expression of all three

256

cytokines. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of 3.2 µM and 6.4 µM dexamethasone after 1 h

257

were relatively lower, but similar to CCE after 4 h. This suggests that the effects of

258

dexamethasone on inflammatory signaling pathways are not immediate (36).

259

Cinnamaldehyde showed a clear dose dependence in reducing the mRNA expression of all

260

three cytokines examined (Fig. 3). This was expected, since the cinnamaldehyde in CCE

261

interferes with TLR4 receptor dimerization and thus inhibits the activation of NF-κB by LPS

262

(28). This can explain the faster action of cinnamaldehyde compared to dexamethasone,

263

because inflammatory TLR4 signaling is blocked already outside the cell. As shown in Figure

264

2, a CA concentration of 50 µM elicited cytotoxic effects, which additionally influences gene

265

expression. Concentrations of 30 µM CA and 3.2 µM dexamethasone were similarly potent

266

in suppressing inflammatory signaling. In these experiments, the effect of 30 µM CA on IL-1β

267

and TNF expression was comparable to that of CCE, but the effect was less pronounced for

268

IL-8. Overall, whole CCE seems to be more efficient than cinnamaldehyde in the

269

suppression of mRNA expression of inflammatory genes. We also observed this

270

phenomenon in a previous study; one possible explanation might lie in the synergistic effects

271

of CA with p-cymene, cinnamyl alcohol, and cinnamic acid, which are additional active

272

compounds of CCE (27).

281

For quantification of the effects of CCE, CA, and dexamethasone on IL-8 cytokine release,

282

THP-1 monocytes were pre-incubated with 0.2% or 0.3% CCE, equivalent concentrations of

283

ethanol, or with 3.2 µM or 6.4 µM dexamethasone (Fig. 4A), and seven different

284

concentrations of CA (Fig. 4B). LPS was added in a final concentration of 50 ng/mL, and the

285

cells were incubated for a further 4 h. Supernatants were collected and analyzed by IL-8

286

ELISA. The baseline IL-8 expression of untreated cells was set to zero, while the IL-8

287

expression of the LPS-treated cells was set to 100% in both experimental settings. The

288

addition of 0.2% and 0.3% ethanol had no effect on IL-8 protein expression. CCE in a

289

concentration of 0.2% had a similar effect to 3.2 µM or 6.4 µM dexamethasone (Fig 4A).

290

CCE at a concentration of 0.3% was more effective for the suppression of IL-8 than either of

291

the dexamethasone concentrations used. CA at concentrations of 30 µM and 40 µM

292

inhibited TLR4-dependent IL-8 expression to an extent comparable to the dexamethasone

293

concentrations used (Fig. 4B).

294
295

Taken together, CCE and CA can dampen the activation of TLR4-dependent pathways

296

during inflammation. This suggests that cinnamon compounds may also reduce the

297

ROS/RNS-stimulated, DAMP-mediated activation of TLR4 during severe inflammation

298

(Fig. 1).

In vitro angiogenesis assay

301

Reactive angiogenesis is another complication present in SARS-CoV-2-infected organs in

302

COVID-19. The tube formation assay in HUVEC cells is a common cellular model for

303

angiogenesis (37). We carried out preliminary tube formation assay experiments in vitro to

304

determine whether CCE can also mitigate this complication of COVID-19.

If HUVEC cells are cultivated onto solubilized and subsequently solidified basement

morphogenetic pattern is caused by a sprouting of endothelial cells, which is routinely used

321

as a surrogate for angiogenesis. The temporal analysis of this morphogenetic process by

322

fluorescence light microscopy revealed an inhibitory effect of 0.1% CCE after 3.5 h and 6 h

323

hours (Fig. 5B), whereas higher dosages (0.5% and 1.0% cinnamon, Fig. 5C and 5D)

324

showed direct cytotoxic effects. The analysis of this sprouting process by scanning electron

The inhibition of angiogenesis by CCE and CA is well documented in the literature (38-43).

Side effects of corticosteroids

331

Despite the clinical efficacy of dexamethasone for COVID-19 patients, unwanted side-effects

332

are known for corticosteroids, e.g. steroid psychosis (45), hyperglycemia, especially in

333

diabetic patients (46), and secondary bacterial pneumonia or invasive fungal infection from

334

immunosuppression (47). Hypothetically, cinnamon or cinnamaldehyde should act

335

synergistically with dexamethasone. A combination of both may thus allow the administration

336

of a reduced dosage of dexamethasone. As shown in an animal model, the concurrent

337

intake of cinnamon can mitigate the side-effects of dexamethasone (48). Cinnamon can also

338

positively influence insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, and glucose transport (48, 49).

339
340

Dosage form and dosage

341

Ethanolic cinnamon extract is much more suitable than cinnamon powder for cell culture

342

experiments, since, in contrast to the powder form, it can be applied quantitatively by

343

pipetting directly into the culture medium. In contrast, the majority of clinical studies on

344

cinnamon have used encapsulated cinnamon bark powder (30). Since almost no reports

345

describing ethanolic CCE for human use have been published to date, future studies on

346

COVID-19 patients should use the encapsulated powder. Typically, doses of encapsulated

347

cinnamon vary between 500 mg and 3 g per day for adults (50-54). However, to the best of

348

our knowledge, no study administering cinnamon alone or in combination with

349

dexamethasone for COVID-19 has been published to date. Therefore, clinical studies are

350

needed before the treatment of COVID-19 patients with cinnamon or its compounds can be

351

recommended. The Ceylon cinnamon should be of pharmaceutical grade as described here.

352

Since dexamethasone and cinnamon act to dampen inflammation via distinct pathways, we

353

suggest that these compounds are likely to have synergistic effects when administered

354

concomitantly.

355

Conclusions

356

Cinnamon has been used as a medicine for thousands of years in traditional medical

357

practices (55). Its anti-inflammatory effects are well documented. The inhibition of TLR4

358

dimerization, in particular, is an important anti-inflammatory mechanism (28). During the so

359

called ‘cytokine storm’, not only cytokines but also ROS/RNS and DAMPs contribute to

360

amplification of inflammation (56). Our results indicate that dexamethasone, which is now

361

being used to dampen excessive inflammation in COVID-19, could be combined with a

362

Ceylon cinnamon preparation. In contrast to dexamethasone, which inhibits the activity of

363

the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB (22), cinnamon can suppress the secondary

364

activation of TLR4 by DAMPs (28). These differences in modes of action suggest the

365

possibility of synergistic effects. Further studies may pave the way towards clinical studies of

366

cinnamon derivatives for the treatment of COVID-19.

367

Our results suggest that intake of Ceylon cinnamon in combination with dexamethasone may

368

prevent the ‘cytokine storm’ and help to reduce the dosage of dexamethasone and mitigate

369

its side effects. Preliminary results indicate that cinnamon may also reduce angiogenesis.

370

Note, however, that Ceylon cinnamon should not be substituted by Cassia cinnamon, which

371

may comprise high amounts of liver-toxic coumarin (31).
