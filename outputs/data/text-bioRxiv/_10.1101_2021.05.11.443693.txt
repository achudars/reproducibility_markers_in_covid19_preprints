Abstract

27

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third coronavirus in less

28

than 20 years to spillover from an animal reservoir and cause severe disease in humans. High

29

impact respiratory viruses such as pathogenic beta-coronaviruses and influenza viruses, as well

30

as other emerging respiratory viruses, pose an ongoing global health threat to humans. There is

31

a critical need for physiologically relevant, robust and ready to use,

32

platforms to rapidly model the infectivity of emerging respiratory viruses and discover and

33

develop new antiviral treatments. Here, we validate

34

tracheobronchial tissue equivalents and assess their usefulness as in vitro assay platforms in the

Introduction

43

Newly emerging viral pathogens such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

44

(SARS-CoV-2) and other re-emerging respiratory viral threats, including influenza viruses, are a

45

constant burden to human public health. A year after the initial discovery of the novel SARS-

46

CoV-2 in 2019 [1, 2], the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains largely

47

uncontrolled. While global vaccination efforts are underway, they are challenged by the

48

emergence of viral variants of concern (VoC) that can potentially escape humoral immunity [3,

49

4, 6, 7]. Due to immune escape as well as the potential for newly emergent CoV strains,

50

identifying effective anti-CoV drug is critical [8].

51

Several established cell lines permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection

52

high-throughput antiviral drug screening (HTS) efforts, including the African green monkey

53

kidney Vero E6 cells, human hepatoma Huh7 and Huh7.5, colon carcinoma Caco2 cells, lung

54

adenocarcinoma Calu-3, and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) overexpressing

55

adenocarcinoma A549 cells, HEK293T cells, and several other non-human cell lines [4, 9-16].

56

While these cell lines are important tools for viral research, there is now evidence that many of

57

the antiviral activities discovered are limited to the cells used for screening. For example, while

58

hydroxychloroquine potently blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells and Huh7 [4, 17], it is

59

inactive against human Calu-3 lung cells [10, 18], and in both prophylactic and post-infection

60

SARS-CoV-2’s in either rhesus macaque or golden Syrian hamster models [19-21].

61

Hydroxychloroquine is also ineffective in randomized COVID-19 human clinical trials [22, 23].

62

Animal models have been developed for pre-clinical drug development of COVID-19, but the

in vitro

have been used for

63

low-throughput nature of high biocontainment models limits drug screening. There remains

64

therefore a critical need for in

65

efficacy, which can be used to prioritize compounds selection for animal testing.

66

Air-liquid interface (ALI) lung cultures provide a bridge between cultured cell lines and animal

67

models [24-30]. In addition to more closely replicating the physiological environment of the

68

human lung epithelium, ALI lung cultures support the replication of human coronaviruses

69

(HCoV) with limited host cell range including HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-

70

OC43 [29, 31-34]. To address the current shortcomings of traditional antiviral screening models,

71

we investigated the use and predictive efficacy of ALI lung tissue equivalents modeling two

72

regions of the lower respiratory tract – the tracheobronchial region and the alveolar region – in

73

the context of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infections.

74

In light of the critical role for cytokines in severe COVID-19 development, we further

75

investigated the tissue-specific cytokine profiles of both tissue equivalents in response to SARS-

76

CoV-2 compared to influenza infection. Cytokines likely play a multifaceted role in SARS-CoV-2

77

infection. On one hand, appropriate cytokine and chemokine induction is important for local

78

viral clearance in tissues, whereas excessive cytokine production and altered cytokine balance is

79

a key component of the COVID-19-associated cytokine storm [35-41]. While elevated serum

80

cytokines associated with severe COVID-19 have been reported, major inflammatory

81

contributing cytokines in locally infected lung tissue remain unknown [41, 42], in part because

82

of the difficulty to measure intratissue cytokine levels in live patients during the course of

83

infection and the relatively short half-life of secreted cytokines. The ability to model cytokine

84

production profiles.

We established the cellular complexity of lung epithelial ALI tissue models for both SARS-CoV-2

87

and influenza, their infectivity rates and patterns, host cytokine production as it relates to viral

Results

94

Human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI lung tissue equivalents present lung epithelial cell
differentiation and expression of known SARS-CoV-2 host entry co-factors

95

ALI alveolar tissue equivalents are comprised of lung epithelial alveolar type I and type II cells,

96

pulmonary fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In contrast, the tracheobronchial tissue equivalents

97

are comprised of ciliated cells, goblet or secretory cells, and basal cells. hACE2 is a known host

98

entry factor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [43, 44] that is highly expressed (as determined

99

by scRNAseq studies) in alveolar type II cells (ATII) and also expressed at lower levels in ciliated

100

cells and some goblet cells [45-47]. By immunofluorescence with well characerrized antibodies

101

(antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1) we first examined expression of ACE2 and

102

established lung cell marker antigens in both human alveolar and tracheobronchial ALI cultures.

103

ACE2 was robustly expressed in the apical epithelium in both post-day 21 tracheobronchial ALI

104

cultures (Fig. 1a, top row), and apical epithelium of post-day 21 alveolar ALI cultures (Fig. 1b,

105

top row). Type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 is another well-characterized virus

106

entry host co-factor for both SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza viruses, and

107

transmembrane glycoprotein neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) enhances furin-dependent SARS-CoV-2

infection

109

tracheobronchial and alveolar tissues using antibody-mediated detection (Fig. 1a, 1b, second

110

and third rows). As expected, tracheobronchial tissue equivalents also exhibited robust staining

111

acetylated α-tubulin as a marker for ciliated cells (α-tubulin+), mucin 5AC which is expressed on

112

goblet or secretory cells (MUC5AC+) [53], and cytoskeletal protein cytokeratin 5 expressed in

113

basal cells (KRT5+) [54], whereas alveolar tissue equivalents stained positive for actin filaments

114

(Phalloidin+), alveolar type I (AQP5+, not shown) and alveolar type II (SP-B+) markers (Figs. 1

115

and 2). In tracheobronchial tissues, we observed positive co-staining of either ACE2, TMPRSS2,

116

or NRP-1 with both α-tubulin+ ciliated cells as well as MUC5AC+ goblet cells (Fig. 1a). While

117

most ACE2, TMPRSS2, or NRP-1 co-expressed with SP-B positive cells in alveolar tissues, a small

118

minority of cells that were SP-B negative also expressed the probed SARS-CoV-2 entry cofactors

in vitro

[44, 48-52]. We also observed robust TMPRSS2 and NRP-1 expression in both

shown in Supplemental Figure 1.

122

SARS-CoV-2 and IAV productively infect human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue
equivalents

123

We next determined whether SARS-CoV-2 and/or influenza A viruses (IAV) can infect human

124

alveolar and tracheobronchial tissue equivalents. For this, we infected both tissues with either

125

H1N1 IAV strains A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) or pandemic A/California/07/2009 (pH1N1), or

126

the clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2/WA/2020/D614, at an approximate multiplicity of infection

127

(MOI) of total cells of 0.1-0.2. At indicated time-points (24 hpi for IAV and 36 hpi for SARS-CoV-

128

2) after infection, we inactivated the virus by whole tissue fixation and stained for SARS-CoV-2

129

or IAV viral antigens, cell-type specific markers, and F-actin to observe tissue integrity, infection

130

rates, and infected cell types (Supplementary Table 1). In IAV exposed tracheobronchial tissue

131

equivalents, we observed infection of multiple cell types at 24 hpi, with basal cells being the

132

dominant infected cell type, followed by ciliated cells and goblet cells (Fig. 2a, Supplemental

133

Fig. 2a and 2b). In SARS-CoV-2 infected tracheobronchial tissue equivalents, we observed co-

134

staining of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen with both ciliated and goblet cells 36 h after initial infection

135

(Fig. 2a; Supplemental Fig. 2c), in agreement with the location of known SARS-CoV-2 host entry

136

co-factors, as described above. In alveolar tissues, the majority of cells infected by IAV or SARS-

137

CoV-2 were positive for SP-B, indicating primary infection of AT-IIs, although another SP-B

138

negative cell subpopulation was also positive for SARS-CoV-2 N antigen (Fig. 2b).

139
140

Human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue equivalents exhibit slower viral infection
kinetics for SARS-CoV-2 compared to IAV

141

Unlike IAV, which has a relatively short clinical incubation period of 1.5-2 days, SARS-CoV-2 has

142

an average incubation period of 5.5 days after initial infection [55]. Thus, we investigated

143

whether this is reflected in the tracheobronchial and alveolar lung tissue equivalents. Our data

144

indicate that the number of IAV PR8 infected cells (MOI 0.1, per total cells) in both

145

tracheobronchial and alveolar tissues rapidly spiked at 24 hpi, followed by a gradual decline in

146

both infected ALI systems (Fig. 3a and b) and in secreted virus (Fig. 3c), in agreement with the

147

robust and rapid replication described in the human host. Infection with IAV pH1N1 (MOI 0.1)

148

resulted in the highest staining of IAV antigen at 48 hpi in both ALI tissue systems (Fig. 3a and

149

3b), with peak viral release at 48 hpi in alveolar ALI tissues and 72 hpi in tracheobronchial ALI

150

tissues, followed by a decline in infectious virion production by 144 hpi post-infection (Fig. 3c).

151

Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 replication in both tissues was slower and of less magnitude (as shown

152

by the total viral titers/insert shown in Fig. 3c) when compared to IAV, and in agreement with a

153

longer incubation period in the human host. Indeed, the number of SARS-CoV-2 N antigen

154

positive cells in both tissues was low at early timepoints, but continued to increase steadily

155

over time in infected tissues independently of the MOI used for the stainings (0.1 to 1), with

156

tracheobronchial tissues exhibiting peak infection at 72 hpi (Fig. 3a) and alveolar tissues at the

157

latest time-point tested (144 hpi) (Fig. 3b). Correspondingly, infectious virion production from

158

SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar tissues peaked at 144 hpi indicating a steady and increasing

159

infection over the tested 6 days period (Fig. 3c). In tracheobronchial tissues, viral production

160

was also dose-dependent, although infection with higher MOIs (approximately 3 and 10)

161

resulted in a higher virion production at 24 hpi, followed by a decline in later timepoints, which

162

may be due to cell death as a result of an initially high viral exposure (Fig. 3c). Interestingly,

163

alveolar tissues seemed to be more susceptible to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection than

164

tracheobronchial cultures, as evidenced by the higher number of infected cells (Fig. 3b) and

165

viral titers (Fig.3c). Cellular markers for each time-point are shown in Supplemental Fig. 2. Thus,

166

both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 can productively infect lung tissue equivalents, though with different

167

kinetics that may contribute to their different clinical incubation periods.

168
169

Human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissue equivalents exhibit distinct inflammatory
cytokine profiles in response to IAV or SARS-CoV-2 infection

170

Secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines during respiratory viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 or IAV

171

is a major contributor to severe COVID-19 disease and severe influenza in humans, respectively

172

[1, 56-59]. The cellular sources of these cytokines and underlying inflammatory mechanisms,

173

however, remain uncertain. It has been proposed that both lung epithelial cells and alveolar

174

macrophages may directly produce local tissue cytokines and immune markers in response to

175

SARS-CoV-2 infection [45, 60, 61]. In IAV infection, the interplay between epithelial, endothelial,

176

and innate immune cells is likely critical to cytokine storm development, with pulmonary

177

endothelium playing a critical amplifier role[59, 62]. Although our lung tissue equivalents

178

modeled in this study lack the myeloid cellular compartment, which plays an important role in

179

the innate immune response, we were still able to investigate alveolar with endothelium

180

tracheobronchial epithelial chemokine and cytokine production in response to viral infection.

181

To determine this tissue-specific immune response, we infected both lung tissue equivalents at

182

indicated MOIs and sampled basal media supernatants at 24, 48, 72, and 144 hpi. We used a a

183

custom multiplex Luminex assay to measure COVID-19 associated cytokines/chemokines [1, 56,

184

57, 63] including interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 or interferon gamma-

185

induced protein 10 (CXCL-10/IP-10), C-C motif ligand 3 or macrophage inflammatory protein 1

186

alpha (CCL3/MIP-1α), C-C motif ligand 2 or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2/MCP-1),

187

interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 1a (IL-1RA) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),

188

as well as several other Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines and interferons (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Supplemental

189

Fig. 3).

190

We observed that the level of induction for most of the immune markers varied significantly in

191

a virus- and tissue-dependent manner (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Supplemental Fig. 3). Overall, tissues

192

infected with influenza virus showed a stronger immune response (Fig. 4, Fig. 5), corresponding

193

with the higher viral titers reported in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 3). Chemokine

194

levels were significantly increased in both tracheobronchial and alveolar tissues infected with

195

either A/Cal/07/2009/H1N1 or A/PR/8/1934/H1N1 influenza strains (with the exception of

196

CCL2/MCP-1 in tracheobronchial tissues), showing an early and robust response at 24 or 48 hpi,

197

correlated with maximum viral production (Fig. 3), that was maintained until later timepoints

198

(Fig. 4). Interestingly, chemokine production after SARS-CoV-2 infection was greatly dependent

199

on tissue type and appeared to be mostly restricted to tracheobronchial tissues, which showed

200

significantly higher production compared to uninfected controls at either early (CCL2/MCP-1

201

and CCL3/MIP-1α, Fig. 4a, Fig. 4b) or later (CXCL-8/IL-8 and CXCL-10/IP-10, Fig. 4c, Fig. 4d)

202

timepoints. CXCL-10/IP-10, an important chemoattractant for neutrophils, was the only

203

chemokine in our panel induced in SARS-CoV-2 infected alveolar tissues, starting at 48 hpi and

204

significantly increased at 72 and 144 hpi (Fig. 4d), corresponding to the increased number of

205

infectious viral particles at later timepoints (Fig. 3c). The increased chemokine levels observed

206

in lung tissue equivalents, especially in the tracheobronchial model, are in agreement with the

207

chemokine storm observed in severe human COVID-19 cases and different SARS-CoV-2

208

experimental models [64], where the role of CXCL-10 has been particularly highlighted in

209

COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as well as in severe

210

influenza[59].

211

We next examined inflammatory Th1, Th2, and Th17 immune responses to IAV and SARS-CoV-2

212

infection, including type I (IFN-α and IFN-β), type II (IFN-γ), and type III (IFN-λ) interferons.

213

Although not in high amounts, we observed a modest but significant type I/II interferon

214

response in some of the IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues compared to the uninfected

215

controls (Fig. 5). IL-28A/IFN- λ2 protein levels were below the limit of detection. Specifically, in

216

SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues, IFN-α and IFN-γ levels were increased in the tracheobronchial

217

model but not in the alveolar, suggesting a tissue-specific response to the viral infection at early

218

timepoints, whereas IFN-β was not detected in either tissue (Fig. 5, Supplemental Fig.3). In

219

addition, most Th1 (TNF-α, TNF-β, IL-2), Th2 (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18), and Th17 (IL-17) immune

220

markers tested were elevated in both IAV infected tissue equivalents compared to uninfected

221

controls at several timepoints (Fig. 6, Supplemental Fig. 3), demonstrating a modest but

222

sustained inflammatory response to influenza, especially in the alveolar model. In contrast, the

223

cytokine response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was again mostly observed in tracheobronchial

224

cultures, with highest detected secretion at early timepoints but decreasing after 72 hpi (with

225

the exception of IL-10 that was maintained until 144 hpi, Fig. 6d) (Fig. 6, Supplemental Fig. 3).

226

Only TNF-α (Fig. 6a), IL-10 (Fig.6d), and IL-18 (Supplemental Fig. 3) showed moderate but

227

significant increased levels in alveolar tissues at 72 and 144 hpi, respectively, in correlation with

228

maximum viral production (Fig. 3). IL-1β was not detected in either tissue during SARS-CoV-2

229

infection.

230

We also measured secreted IL-6, which has been associated with the acute inflammatory

231

response and cytokine storm characteristic of severe COVID-19 and severe influenza, as well as

232

the increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to maintain immune homeostasis

233

[57, 65-67]. The presence and ratio of IL-6 and IL-10 may be used as predictors of COVID-19

234

disease severity. In our SARS-CoV-2 infected tissue lung equivalents, IL-6 was only increased in

235

tracheobronchial cultures at 24 and 48 hpi (slightly decreasing at 72 hpi and normalizing to

236

uninfected control levels at 144 hpi), whereas IL-10 was significantly higher in both

237

tracheobronchial and alveolar cultures starting at 48 hpi and maintained at later timepoints

238

(Fig. 6c, Supplemental Fig. 3). In addition, both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues showed an

239

elevated production of another anti-inflammatory protein, IL-1RA (Fig. 6e), indicating that these

240

models are capable of producing reported COVID-19 associated molecules to suppress

241

inflammation during viral infection.

242

Lastly, we observed increased production of other immune markers such as G-CSF, which

243

controls neutrophil development and function, and EN-RAGE/S100A12, which participates in

244

the migration and recruitment of leukocytes and promotes cytokine and chemokine

245

production, as well as IL-7 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) which can mediate T-cell

246

development and are markers of neutrophil activation. All four markers have been found

247

elevated in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients [68, 69], and increased levels have also

248

been correlated with the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 disease severity. We

249

observed increase of all four proteins in response to both IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in

250

tracheobronchial tissues up to 72 hpi; but not in alveolar cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2

251

(Fig. 4e, Fig. 4f, Fig. 6f, Supplemental Fig. 3).

252

Validation of antiviral drugs in lung tissue equivalents

253

To evaluate the ability of these physiological relevant ALI tissues to measure antiviral drug

254

activity, we tested a panel of antiviral drugs on either tracheobronchial or alveolar cultures for

255

antiviral activity. We first tested remdesivir, which has been granted emergency use

256

[70], and type I interferon (IFN-β) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. As expected, both remdesivir

258

and IFN-β robustly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection as seen by qRT-PCR and direct SARS-CoV-2

259

antigen staining in the tracheobronchial tissue model (Fig. 7, Supplemental Fig. 4).

260

Furthermore, we tested two other compounds: cyclosporine, previously identified in a high-

throughput screen with anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in both human hepatoma (Huh7.5

262

cells) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (Calu-3) in a monolayer cell-based model [10], as

263

well as hydroxychloroquine. Neither cyclosporine nor hydroxychloroquine reduced SARS-CoV-2

264

infection in the tracheobronchial lung model (10μM, Fig. 7a, bottom two rows, Fig. 7c,

265

Supplemental Fig. 5a, 5c). Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine failed to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral

266

production in the alveolar model (10μM, Supplemental Fig. 5d). However, when we tested

267

camostat, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, and nelfinavir, an anti-retroviral, currently being tested in

268

clinical trials [44, 71-74], both reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in the tracheobronchial ALI tissue

269

(Fig. 7a, 7c, Supplemental Fig. 5a, 10μM) and alveolar ALI tissue (Supplemental Fig. 5b, 10μM).

270

We next tested whether anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds remdesivir and nelfinavir would also

271

reduce IAV infection in the tracheobronchial (Fig. 6b) or alveolar (Fig. 7c) ALI tissue models.

272

Neither remdesivir nor nelfinavir reduced IAV antigen staining in these tissues. However,

273

clinically approved anti-IAV compounds zanamivir and oseltamivir, as well as the reported anti-

274

IAV drug salinomycin, did inhibit IAV infection using a single dose approach in the

275

tracheobronchial (Fig. 7d) ALI tissues at 10μM, as well as in a dose-dependent manner as

276

expected (Supplemental Fig. 5). The TMPRSS2 inhibitor nafamostat also failed to block IAV

277

infection in the tracheobronchial model, although we did observe a significant reduction in viral

278

production (data not shown). Taken together, these findings validate the use of lung tissue

279

equivalents for studying the efficacy of anti-viral drugs.

281

Discussion

282

We have shown that both primary human tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues in a

283

transwell plate format are relevant models for studying multiple aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV

284

infection, in addition to being a valuable platform for antiviral drug testing. Progression of

285

infection from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract is necessary for both

286

severe COVID-19 and influenza. Samples taken from patients with fatal COVID-19 have shown

287

infection in ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, AT-IIs, goblet cells, club-like cells, and

288

endothelial cells [75-77]. Similarly, in the described tissue models we see SARS-CoV-2 infection,

289

peaking at 3-6 dpi, of both ciliated (α-tubulin+) and goblet (MUC5AC+) cell populations in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443693; this version posted May 12, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

290

tracheobronchial ALI tissues, as well ATs in the alveolar ALI tissue model. We also observed

291

robust SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infectious viral production in both tissues, although apical

292

washes collected from alveolar tissues exhibited slightly higher SARS-CoV-2 titers than

293

tracheobronchial (approx. 2x103 PFU/tissue in apical wash of tracheobronchial ALI tissues and

294

approx. 8x103 PFU/tissue in an apical wash of alveolar ALI tissues). In contrast, a previously

295

reported lung-on-chip model, consisting of primary human ATs and human lung microvascular

296

endothelial cells, did not find productive infection with SARS-CoV-2 in ATs (Thacker et al., 2020).

297

This may be due to the absence of hACE2 expression in ATs in the lung-on-chip model

298

compared to robust hACE2 expression in the alveolar tissues in this study. While we did not

299

observe SARS-CoV-2 N antigen in endothelial cells in our ALI tissue models, this may be because

300

we only exposed the tissue apical side to the viral inoculum. In this regard, future studies will

301

need to look at viral infection over an extended period to further characterize the full infection

302

dynamics in the tracheobronchial and alveolar lung tissue equivalents, in addition to direct

303

exposure of lung endothelial cells to SARS-CoV-2.

304

Elevated cytokine levels and pathogenic inflammation plays a central role in COVID-19

305

morbidity and mortality. Circulating chemokines, interferons, interleukins, growth factors and

306

other pro-inflammatory cytokines as the main molecules involved in the development of the

307

cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 severity, including IL-6, IL-2, IL-10, CXCL-10/IP-10,

308

TNF, IFN-γ, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL4/MIP1β, or G-CSF. In particular, high levels of IL-6 and TNF are

309

strongly associated with increased mortality, and elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines

310

IL-10 and IL-1RA have also been correlated with disease severity and fatal outcome [1, 56, 57,

311

63, 65, 78]. Circulating cytokines observed in serum may not, however, represent local tissue

312

cytokine levelswhich may be key potentiators of the systemic hyperinflammatory response.

313

There have been extensive investigation into immunomodulatory drugs for the treatment of

314

COVID-19 [42].

315

In agreement with previous COVID-19 reports, we did find a significant induction of IP-

316

10/CXCL10 levels in both tracheobronchial and alveolar SARS-CoV-2 infected tissues (up to 25-

317

fold increase in alveolar cultures compared to uninfected controls), as well as other important

318

chemokines and growth factors (CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CXCL-8/IL-8, G-CSF) that were

319

elevated in tracheobronchial cultures. Interferon (IFN-α and IFN-γ) and Th1, Th2, and Th17

320

cytokine responses were only moderate but significant, and mostly restricted to

321

tracheobronchial tissues. It included pro-inflammatory (IL-6 and TNF-α), and anti-inflammatory

322

(IL-10 and IL-1RA) immune modulators, both which are known to have key roles in the

323

pathogenesis associated to COVID-19 disease [1, 56, 57, 65, 78]. As demonstrated by the

324

Luminex data, the cytokine induction after SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be tissue-

325

dependent in our ALI models. Interestingly, even though alveolar tissues had a more robust

326

infection compared to tracheobronchial cultures (as shown by the higher viral loads reported in

327

Fig. 3), the cytokine and chemokine production was not as strong when compared to the

328

response observed in tracheobronchial cultures. Still, both tissues had an overall immune

329

response that corresponded with the infection dynamics, with alveolar tissues showing slight

330

increases in some cytokines at later timepoints (72 to 144 hpi) compared to earlier responses

331

(24 to 72 hpi) in the tracheobronchial model.

332

A major limitation of these models is that we were only able to study the local epithelial-driven

333

response by itself, without the contribution of myeloid cells or lymphocytes, which are

334

important in mounting an appropriate innate immune response against viral infections. In

335

general, we observed that both tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues are capable of

336

mounting a local epithelial-driven response to IAV and SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Overall, IAV

337

infected tissues had a stronger and earlier inflammatory response than SARS-CoV-2 infected ALI

338

tissues, including inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory immune modulators. And although

339

myeloid cells were not included in this model, we hypothesize that the addition of the myeloid

340

compartment in both tissues will show a more pronounced immune response that may reflect

341

more accurately the different stages of human COVID-19 and severe influenza disease

342

progression. Future studies will address the contribution of the lung epithelium and its role in

343

recruiting additional inflammatory immune cells.

344

While there has been intense high-throughput screening efforts to discover potential antivirals

345

for SARS-CoV-2, relatively few compounds have proven to be effective in clinical settings. Most

346

of the studies published have relied on traditional mono-cellular tissue culture models, which

347

do not allow crosstalk among different cell populations. In some cases, relying on

in vitro

348

activity profiles may prove detrimental. This is the case for hydroxychloroquine, initially shown

349

to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

350

patient outcome or hospitalization stay [22, 23]. Interestingly, hydroxychloroquine failed to

351

reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in our

352

models might mimic better human tissue responses than other in vitro systems.

353

A 3D lung tissue model may be more high throughput and more accessible route for drug

354

validation studies for newly emerged viral pathogens compared to small animal models, as they

355

can readily be deployed and utilized in labs that do not specialize in animal models, do not

356

require pharmacokinetics studies to be carried out prior to antiviral evaluation, and can easily

357

be scaled up to include dose-response testing. While the study described here used 9mm and

358

12mm transwell inserts, these models can be readily adapted for use in a further miniaturized

359

96-well format which will increase throughput of the model for drug testing. In both the

360

tracheobronchial and the alveolar ALI models, we were able to demonstrate robust antiviral

361

activity of known anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound remdesivir, while also excluding hit compounds

362

from 2D monolayer culture systems. Whether ALI tissue models can provide more accurate

363

results regarding their efficacy

364

consideration with a compound’s pharmacokinetic properties. These models can also work in

365

parallel with animal model efforts, by serving as an accessible and physiologically relevant

366

human-based platform on which to prioritize compound selection for animal testing and further

367

pre-clinical evaluation.

368

Several lung ALI models have been described within the last year to assess both IAV and CoV

369

infectivity, including SARS-CoV-2, each with advantages and limitations. Small airway and

370

alveolar lung-on-chip models have been published or reported in pre-prints [29, 79-83]. In

371

addition, upper respiratory tract models such as nasal epithelium, which express high levels of

372

SARS-CoV-2 receptors, have also been reported as successful in vitro culture systems for SARS-

373

CoV-2 infection [84, 85]. Lung-on-chip models mostly recreate the interface between lung

374

epithelial cells at the ALI and an endothelial cell monolayer. In many instances, the endothelial

375

cells are exposed to liquid flow, and in some models, mechanical stretching is included in the

376

chip design to mimic breathing[83]. Many of the lung-on-chip systems are low throughput, not

377

readily compatible with laboratory automation used in drug screening facilities, and some cases

378

chips are made of polydimethylsiloxane PDMS, thus limiting its use for drug testing. The use of

379

a transwell-based multi-well plate assay platform as described in our study enables a versatile

380

and modular approach for the future biofabrication of tissue ALI models with tailored

381

physiological complexity and disease relevance. As an example, we have reported the use of

382

bioprinting technique to create a vascularized skin tissue [86] and the same approach can be

383

applied to recreate a vascularized lung ALI tissue model. Addition of non-lymphocyte immune

384

cells has also been explored using transwell plates with biofabricated tissue equivalents [87]

385

which can be applied to the lung ALI assay systems to assess the participation of innate immune

386

cells in infectivity and COVID-19 relevant immune responses. Transwell multi-well plates are

387

compatible for laboratory automation equipment for the implementation of drugs screens.

388

Lung ALI tissue equivalents can be biofabricated in a 96-well transwell plate to enable a

389

remarkable increase in the numbers of compounds that can be tested and therefore serve as an

390

effective selection step for animal testing and reducing cost. We envision that newer lung ALI

391

platforms will be developed based on these protocols and the benchmarks described in this

392

study, and will include additional physiological features desired in a lung tissue model. In this

393

regard, Zamprogno et al. have described a lung-on-chip platform that is open access and

394

includes stretching, and it is high-throughput compatible[83].

395

In summary, we have described the characterization of two distinct lower respiratory tract lung

396

epithelial ALI tissue models for studying SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infection in relation to complex

397

tissue-related

recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, including a variant of the 2009 pH1N1. In

400

addition, using known and novel antivirals we demonstrate the pharmacological validity of

401

these two models as antiviral drug screening assay platforms. This characterization will serve as

402

the foundation to biofabricate lung ALI tissue models, which may include additional

physiological features that are relevant for the infection of respiratory viruses and the disease

Methods

407

Viral Propagation - Vero E6 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection

408

(ATCC CRL-1586) and cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1%

409

penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% L-Glutamine. SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks were generated as

410

previously described[10, 88, 89]. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS +

411

10mM HEPES buffer for 1 day prior to inoculation with the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain

412

(BEI resources, NR-52281) (GenBank MN985325.1) using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI,

413

0.001), in order to generate an initial viral seed stock. At 72 hpi, tissue culture supernatants

414

were collected and clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at −80°C. The virus stock

415

obtained from BEI Resources was a passage 4 (P4) stock and was used to generate a master

416

seed stock (P5, or P0’) and working stock (P6, or P1’). Viral stock titers were determined by

417

standard plaque forming assay (PFU/ml) as described below. Only stocks passaged once after

418

seed stock (P1’) were used for experiments. All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was carried

419

out in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility following approved protocols.

420

IAV H1N1 strains A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) and A/California/07/2009 (pH1N1) were

421

propagated in the allantoic cavity of 11 days-old embryonated chicken eggs. At 48 hpi, allantoic

422

fluid were collected and aliquots stored at −80°C.

423

Culturing of human 3D in vitro respiratory tissue models - Human tracheobronchial air liquid

424

interface (ALI) cultures (“Epiairway”) and human alveolar ALI cultures (“Epialveolar”) were

425

obtained from MatTek Life Sciences (MA, USA) and cultured according to the manufacturer’s

426

recommended protocol. Epiairway tissues were obtained at day 15 or day 21 post-seeding of

427

primary donor lung cultures. Epiairway tissues obtained at day 15 post-seeding of primary

428

donor lung cultures were further matured in-house in ALI interface for 7 days after receiving

429

with 5 ml basolateral media changes every other day, with mucus washes (400 microliters 1X

430

PBS on apical side) every 3-4 days during maturation, prior to infection. Epialveolar tissues were

431

obtained at day 21 post seeding of primary donor lung cultures and reconstituted overnight

432

with 5ml and 75 μl of Epialveolar media at the basal and apical sides of the tissue, respectively.

433

Medium was changed after overnight recovery, prior to infection. Every other day, 5 ml

434

basolateral media changes (and 75 μl apical media changes for Epialveolar tissues) were

435

performed in both tissues for the duration of the experiments. For all SARS-CoV-2 infection

436

kinetic studies, tissues were infected at day 23.

437

Viral infection of lung tissue equivalents with SARS-CoV-2 or IAV - Tracheobronchial tissues

438

were infected at day 21 or later of maturation to maximize matured ciliated cell populations at

439

time of infection. Prior to viral inoculation, mucus was removed by washing twice the apical

440

surface of tissues with 400 µl of TEER buffer (1X PBS with magnesium and calcium). Tissue

441

inserts were inoculated with 1x105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (for 36 h time-points and antiviral drug

442

screening) or MOI of 0.1 and 1 of IAV (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 or A/California/04/2009) or MOI of

443

0.1, 1, 3, or 10 of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020), assuming an average of 900,000

444

cells/tissue insert, for 1 h (IAV) or 1-4 h (SARS-CoV-2). Viral inoculum was removed and tissue

445

inserts washed with PBS before continued culture. Inserts were cultured in ALI at 37°C, 5% CO2

446

for 24-36 h for antiviral compound validation or 24, 48, 72, and 144 h for viral kinetics profiling,

447

with basal media changes every other day. Alveolar tissues were infected post day 21 with

448

either SARS-CoV-2 or IAV in the manner described above. Multiplicities of infection were

449

calculated based on an average of 600,000 cells/tissue insert). No pre-infection apical washes

450

were carried out for alveolar tissues. Basal media was replaced with fresh media every other

451

day. In alveolar cultures, 75ul of apical media was exchanged every other day. For both

452

tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, mock-infected controls were treated in an identical

453

fashion to viral inoculated controls.

454

Plaque assay for SARS-CoV-2 production - At the corresponding time-points, secreted SARS-

455

CoV-2 was captured by washing the apical tissue with 500 µl or 150 µl of pre-warmed tissue

456

media (for tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues, respectively). Plaque assay to determine

457

viral loads of SARS-CoV-2-infected tissue culture supernatants was performed as previously

458

described (Park et al., 2020; Oludanni et al., 2020). Briefly, Vero E6 monolayers in a 96-well

459

plate format (45×5104 cells/well, performed in duplicate) were infected with 10-fold serial

460

dilutions of collected apical supernatants in infection media (DMEM supplemented with 1%

461

PSG). After viral adsorption (1h at 37°C, 5% CO2), cells were washed with PBS and incubated in

462

post-infection media (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% PSG) containing 1%

463

microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. Plates were then

464

inactivated in 10% neutral buffered formalin (ThermoFisher Scientific) for another 245h prior to

465

removal from the BSL3. For immunostaining, fixed monolayers were washed with PBS three

466

times, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 155min at room temperature (RT), and blocked

467

with 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA in PBS) for 15h at 37°C, followed by incubation with a

468

SARS-CoV N cross-reactive monoclonal antibody (MAb, at 15µg/ml), 1C7C7, diluted in 1% BSA

469

for 15h at 37°C. After incubation with the primary MAb, cells were washed three times with

470

PBS, and developed with the Vectastain ABC kit and DAB Peroxidase Substrate kit (Vector

471

Laboratory, Inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Viral counts were

472

performed using the C.T.L. Immunospot v7.0.15.0 Professional Analysis DC and calculated as

473

PFUs/insert.

474

Focus forming unit (FFU) assay for IAV - At indicated time-points, secreted IAV was captured by

475

washing the apical side of the tissues with 200 µl of 1X PBS. IAV titers produced from

476

tracheobronchial and alveolar ALI tissues were measured by focus forming unit assay. Rhesus

477

monkey kidney epithelial cells LLC-MMK2, overexpressing SIAT1 were seeded 1 day prior in

478

black, 96-well, clear bottom plate to reach a confluency of 95-100% at time of FFU assay. Apical

479

washes containing secreted virus from lung tissue equivalents was diluted in 2% FBS containing

480

EMEM media and used to inoculate LLC-MMK2-SIAT1 cells for 2 h at 37°C. Viral inoculum was

481

removed and replaced with an Avicel-media overlay and cells incubated at 37C/5%CO2 for 48 h.

482

After 48 h, the overlay was removed, cells washed twice with 1X PBS prior to fixation with 4%

483

paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed with 1X PBS three times prior to immunostaining

484

for IAV NP protein and counterstain with Hoechst. All plates were imaged on the InCell2200 and

485

FFU quantified using Columbus Analysis software. All antibodies can be found in

486

Supplementary Table 1.

487

Drug treatments - All compounds were dissolved in DMSO unless otherwise specified. DMSO or

488

compounds were diluted at indicated concentration directly into the basolateral media

489

chamber of the tissue inserts for one hour prior to viral exposure and remained in the media for

490

duration of experiment (24 h for IAV, 36 h for SARS-CoV-2). Hydroxychloroquine was dissolved

491

in water.

492

Immunofluorescence staining and analysis - Tissue inserts were completely submerged in 4%

493

paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for a minimum of 1.5 h or 30 min (if analyzed inside the BSL3)

494

in 12- or 24-well plates (for EpiAlveolar and Epiairway tissues, respectively) before removal of

495

PFA and washing with PBS three times. Tissues were permeabilized in a 0.3%-0.5% Triton X-100

496

in PBS solution for 15 min, followed by blocking in PBTG (1% BSA + 5% goat serum + 0.1% Triton

497

X-100 in PBS) for 30 min to 1 h at RT or overnight at 4°C. Tissues were then stained directly in

498

inserts or removed from inserts using a scalpel and stained whole or as cut into four equal

499

quarters. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBTG (see Supplementary Table 1) and incubated

5% goat serum + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and incubated for 2 h at RT or 1h at 37°C followed by

502

three washes with 1X PBS. Hoechst or DAPI were used to stain DNA (nuclei) of tissues infected

503

with IAV and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Tissues were imaged in the transwell insert or mounted

504

in glass-bottom plates in an automated high content confocal microscope (Opera Phenix, Perkin

505

Elmer) or using the Cytation 5 cell imaging multi-mode reader (Biotek) at 4X magnification,

506

WFOV mode with laser autofocus; whole well images were acquired and analyzed using Gen 5

507

v3.8.01 software.

(forward:AACCCGTTGAACCCCATT, reverse:CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG) or the SARS-CoV-2 N

513

gene (forward: TTACAAACATTGGCCGCAAA, reverse: GCGCGACATTCCGAAGAA) and Power SYBR

514

Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) were used to amplify cellular RNA and viral RNA by

515

QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems). The relative expression levels

516

of SARS-CoV-2 N gene was calculated using the standard curve method and normalized to 18S

517

ribosomal RNA as an internal control.
