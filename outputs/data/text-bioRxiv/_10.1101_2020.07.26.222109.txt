Emergency Use. To maximize delivery to the lungs, we formulated remdesivir as a dry powder for
inhalation using thin film freezing (TFF). TFF produces brittle matrix nanostructured aggregates that
are sheared into respirable low-density microparticles upon aerosolization from a passive dry
powder inhaler. In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type
affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients
exhibited desirable aerosol performance (up to 93.0% FPF; 0.82µm MMAD). Remdesivir was
amorphous after the TFF process, which benefitted drug dissolution in simulated lung fluid. TFF
remdesivir formulations are stable after one-month storage at 25 C/60%RH. In vivo
pharmacokinetic evaluation showed that TFF-remdesivir-leucine was poorly absorbed into systemic
circulation while TFF-remdesivir-Captisol® demonstrated increased systemic uptake compared to
leucine. Remdesivir was hydrolyzed to the nucleoside analog GS-441524 in lung, and levels of GS441524 were greater in lung with the leucine formulation compared to Captisol®. In conclusion, TFF
technology produces high potency remdesivir dry powder formulations for inhalation suitable to treat
patients with COVID-19 on an outpatient basis and earlier in the disease course where effective
antiviral therapy can reduce related morbidity and mortality.

Introduction

28

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing worldwide pandemic. As of

29

September 2020, laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported in 213 countries and territories with

30

more than 30 million reported cases and close to 1 million reported deaths [1]. Although this disease

31

is asymptomatic to mild in most people, in some cases, it can develop into pneumonia, acute

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction [2]. While effective treatments for

33

COVID-19 are urgently needed, including therapeutics and vaccines, currently no drugs are approved

34

to treat COVID-19. Only one drug, remdesivir that is administered by intravenous (IV) injection, has

35

been granted emergency use authorization in adult and pediatric patients hospitalized with severe

36

disease. Therefore, additional therapeutics and routes of administration are needed to treat this

37

respiratory virus.

38

Remdesivir (GS-5734), an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral agent, was developed by

39

Gilead Sciences Inc. [3]. Remdesivir is a monophosphoramide prodrug that is intracellularly

40

metabolized into an adenosine analog (GS-441524) [4]. Both GS-441524 and remdesivir (GS-5734)

41

are metabolized into the active nucleoside triphosphate (GS-443902) by the host [5]. The adenosine

42

nucleoside analog can inhibit viral RNA polymerases, evade proofreading by viral exonucleases, and

43

subsequently decreases viral RNA production [4]. Previous studies demonstrated that remdesivir has

44

broad-spectrum activity against members of the filovirus (e.g., EBOV, MARV) [6], CoVs (e.g., SARS-

45

CoV, MERS-CoV) [7, 8], and paramyxovirus (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra

46

virus) [9].

47

Remdesivir was initially developed for the treatment of EBOLA virus disease [3]. Recently, in

48

vitro studies showed that remdesivir was effective against COVID-19 in the human airway epithelial

49

cell [10]. Short term outcomes of remdesivir were reported for 53 patients infected with COVID-19

50

treated in over 20 hospitals [11]. It was reported that overall clinical improvement was observed in 36

51

of 53 patients (68%) receiving a 10-day regimen of IV remdesivir [11]. However, 32 patients (60%) in

52

the study experienced at least one adverse event, and 12 patients (23%) reported serious adverse

53

events [11]. The most common adverse events included diarrhea, rash, septic shock, acute kidney

54

injury, renal impairment, and hypotension [11, 12]. Several studies are ongoing, including two clinical

55

studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 respiratory

56

disease in humans [13, 14]. In one study, 308 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were given

57

remdesivir as a 200 mg loading dose on day 1, then 100 mg IV once-daily for 9 days [13]. In another

58

study, the same regimen was given to 452 patients with severe clinical manifestations of COVID-19

59

[14].

60

The feasibility to deliver remdesivir via different administration routes (e.g., intravenous (IV)

61

injection, intramuscular (IM) injection and oral administration) has been investigated [3]. Unfortunately,

62

remdesivir is not suitable for oral delivery since the drug is mostly metabolized and cleared by first-

63

pass metabolism, resulting in poor hepatic stability and poor bioavailability [3]. The delivery of

64

remdesivir by the IM route also faces the challenge of variable release from muscle and slow acting

65

of the active compound in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [3]. Therefore, remdesivir is

66

administrated by IV injection since this route allows wide distribution to most tissues including kidney,

67

kidney medulla, and liver [3].

68

For IV administration, remdesivir was developed in two dosage forms, a concentrate solution

69

intended for dilution and administration by infusion and a lyophilized powder for reconstitution and

70

dilution intended for administration by infusion [3]. Since remdesivir is practically insoluble in water,

71

both formulations contain sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBECD) as a solubility enhancer by

72

complexation [3, 15-17]. Since the excipient, SBECD, is cleared by the kidneys, remdesivir is

73

contradicted in patients with several renal impairment [3]. A pharmacokinetic study showed that both

74

formulations are interchangeable based on similar plasma concentrations [3]. Lyophilized remdesivir

75

powder is stable when stored below 30 °C and has a shelf-life of 51 months, while remdesivir

76

concentrate solution for dilution requires the product to be stored at freezing storage conditions

77

(−25 °C to −10 °C) for a shelf-life of 48 months [3].

78

Currently, remdesivir is administered by injection into a vein as an infusion to treat patients

79

with COVID-19 only in hospitals. However, due to the pandemic, many patients are not able to be

80

hospitalized, and they do not have access to injectable administration of remdesivir. To provide

81

remdesivir for other patients besides those most severely ill, more convenient and accessible dosage

82

forms for different routes of administration must be quickly developed and tested so that patients have

83

more options to get treated.

84

Intriguing strategies for future improvement of remdesivir include the development of inhaled

85

dry powder of remdesivir for direct administration to the primary site of infection, the lungs. The

86

mechanism of coronavirus infection is mostly in the respiratory tract, especially in the deep lungs.

87

Hence, the inhalation route must be immediately pursued as the most promising route of

88

administration to maximize direct delivery to the target site without first-pass metabolism, boost local

89

antiviral activity in the lungs, and limit the potential for systemic side effects [18]. In addition, the cost

90

of the drug can be reduced, and the supplies of the drug can be maximized, thus treating more

91

patients due to less dose required by inhalation as compared to injectable forms. The treatment cost

92

can also be decreased when administered by inhalation, since patients may not need to visit hospitals

93

as is required to administer the IV injectable dose. Therefore, more affordable and early stage

94

treatment can be provided to patients with inhaled remdesivir.

95

Nebulization of the current IV formulation in a diluted form is a potential method of pulmonary

96

administration; however, the drug is prone to degrade by hydrolysis in aqueous solution to form the

97

nucleoside monophosphate, which has difficulty penetrating cell membranes, thereby minimizing the

98

antiviral activity in the lung cells [19]. Another concern is the use of SBECD as an excipient in

99

inhalation dosage forms. Although cyclodextrin is not an excipient in an approved FDA inhaled

100

product [20], several reports demonstrated the use cyclodextrin in inhaled formulations. Tolman et al.

101

[21, 22] previously demonstrated that aerosolized voriconazole nebulized solution that contained a

102

diluted form of the commercially available Vfend®, an IV voriconazole dosage form containing

103

SBECD, is capable of producing clinically relevant lung tissue and plasma concentrations of the drug

104

in animals. However, in this form, voriconazole in lung tissue was not able to be detected 6-8 h after

105

administration of a single inhaled dose in the animal study by Tolman et al. [21], while voriconazole

106

dry powder lasted longer in the lungs (up to 24 h) in an animal study by Beinborn et al [23]. Therefore,

107

a dry powder formulation for inhalation can be more favorable with a smaller number of daily doses.

108

The advantages of dry powders for inhalation over liquids administered by nebulizers are not

109

limited only to improve the stability of the drug during inhalation, but also dry powder inhalers provide

110

the ease of maintenance and having a short administration time [24]. The inconvenience of nebulized

111

inhalation solutions includes the use of a large nebulizer device requiring electric power and water,

112

user manipulation for cleaning and operating, and long nebulization times. Also, the cost per dose

113

and initial cost of the nebulizer are higher than a DPI device [24]. Hence, dry powder inhalation is an

114

ideal dosage form for the treatment of COVID-19 in an outpatient setting, which would minimize the

115

risk of spreading the virus to healthcare professionals.

116

Although several techniques have been used to prepare inhalable powders, including

117

mechanical milling and spray drying, the advantages of thin film freezing (TFF) over other techniques

118

rely on the ability to produce aerosolizable particles composed of brittle matrix, nanostructured

119

aggregates. These are high surface area powders that are ideally suited for dry powder inhalation.

120

TFF employs ultra-rapid freezing (on the order of 100-1,000 K/sec) such that precipitation (either as

121

a crystalline nanoaggregate or amorphous solid dispersion) and particle growth of the dissolved

122

solute can be prevented [25]. Subsequently, nanostructured aggregates are formed as a low-density

123

brittle matrix powder [26], which is efficiently sheared into respirable low-density microparticles by a

124

dry powder inhaler upon inhalation by the patient [27]. Despite a large geometric diameter (>10

125

microns), low-density microparticles composed of these nanostructured aggregates can be delivered

126

to the deep lung with optimal aerodynamic diameters of <3 to 4 microns [27]. Additionally, it has been

127

reported that the engineered particles with a geometric diameter greater than 10 microns can extend

128

drug retention time in the lungs due to the ability of the deposited particles to escape from

129

macrophage phagocytosis [28]. According to a recent study by Longest et al., computational models

130

demonstrated that nanoaggregates are favorable for higher drug absorption efficiency and dose

131

uniformity in the lungs, compared to microparticles [29]. Furthermore, TFF can produce amorphous

132

high surface area powders with submicron primary particles, which can enhance the dissolution rate

133

and subsequently improve the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs like remdesivir in the lungs

134

[30].

135

This work aims to apply the TFF technology to develop remdesivir dry powder formulations

136

for inhalation administered by a commercially available dry powder inhaler. We hypothesize that the

137

ultra-rapid freezing rate of the TFF technology will produce low-density, high porosity brittle matrix

138

powders of remdesivir, which are aerosolizable by the shear forces generated from the passive dry

139

powder inhaler, and thus allow high doses of remdesivir to be administered to the lung.

Preparation of dry powder for inhalation using thin film freezing

153

Remdesivir and excipients (i.e., Captisol®, mannitol, lactose and leucine) were dissolved in

154

a mixture of either acetonitrile/water (50/50 v/v) or 1,4-dioxane/water (50/50 v/v) at the solid contents

155

shown in Table 1. The solutions were stored in the refrigerator at 2-8°C before the thin film freezing

Drug quantification (HPLC)

165

The content of remdesivir was determined through analysis with a Thermo Scientific™

166

Dionex™ UltiMate™ 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at a wavelength

167

of 246 nm. A Waters Xbridge C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3.5 m) (Milford, MA) was used at 30 °C

168

and a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The isocratic method was performed for 4.5 minutes using a mobile

169

phase of 50:50 (%v/v) water –acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) TFA. The retention time of remdesivir

170

was approximately ~3.5 minutes. Dimethyl sulfloxide: acetonitrile: water (10:60:30, v/v) was used as

171

diluent. All analyses exhibited linearity in the range tested of 0.2–250 g/mL. All chromatography

172

data were processed by Chromeleon Version 7.2.10 software (Thermo Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA,

173

USA).

174

For quantity and quality analysis of stability samples of TFF-remdesivir powders, Agilent 1220

175

Infinity II LC system equipped with Agilent 1290 Infinity II evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD)

176

was utilized. Waters XBridge BEH C18 column (4.6 x 150 mm, 3.5 m) (Milford, MA) was used at

177

30 °C and a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The gradient method with a mobile phase ratio of 5 to 95 %

178

acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used for total running time of 20 minutes. 10

179

L of each sample was injected. The stability samples were monitored with 246 nm UV and ELSD to

180

detect possible degradants. For ELSD, evaporator and nebulizer temperatures were set at 60 °C, and

181

nitrogen gas flow was 1.6 L/min. The chromatography data were processed by Chemstation version

182

C.01.10.

In vitro aerosol performance

184

The aerodynamic properties of the TFF powder samples were determined using a Next

185

Generation Pharmaceutical Impactor (NGI) (MSP Corp, Shoreview, MN) connected to a High

186

Capacity Pump (model HCP5, Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK) and a Critical Flow Controller

187

(model TPK 2000, Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK). The pre-separator was not used in this study.

188

To avoid particle bounce, the NGI collection plates were coated with 1.5% w/v polysorbate 20 in 100%

189

methanol and then let the plates dry before analysis. A high resistance Plastiape® RS00 inhaler

190

(Plastiape S.p.A, Osnago, Italy) containing size #3 HPMC capsules (V-Caps® Plus, Lonza,

191

Morristown, NJ) and 1-3 mg of powder was attached to a USP induction port by a molded silicon

192

adapter, and the powder was dispersed to the NGI at the flow rate of 60 L/min for 4 s per each

193

actuation. The deposited powders from the capsule, inhaler, adapter, induction port, stages 1-7, and

194

the micro-orifice collector (MOC) were collected by diluting with a mixture of DMSO/water/acetonitrile

195

(10:30:60 v/v). The remdesivir content in the deposited powders was determined using the HPLC

196

method as described in Section 2.3.

197

Copley Inhaler Testing Data Analysis Software (CITDAS) Version 3.10 (Copley Scientific,

198

Nottingham, UK) was used to calculate the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), the

199

geometric standard deviation (GSD), the fine particle fraction (FPF), and the emitted fraction (EF).

200

The EF was calculated as the total amount of remdesivir emitted from the device as a percentage of

201

total amount of remdesivir collected. The FPF of recovered dose was calculated as the total amount

202

of remdesivir collected with an aerodynamic diameter below 5 µm as a percentage of the total amount

203

of remdesivir collected. The FPF of delivered dose was calculated as the total amount of remdesivir

204

collected with an aerodynamic diameter below 5 µm as a percentage of the total amount of remdesivir

205

deposited on the adapter, the induction port, stages 1- 7 and MOC.

TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). Samples of 2-3 mg were weighed and loaded into a T-zero pan.

216

The pan with a T-zero hermetic lid were crimped, and a hole was drilled in the lid before placing the

217

pan in the sample holder. To evaluate the glass transition and glass forming ability type of remdesivir

218

unprocessed powder, samples were heat at a heating ramp rate of 10 °C/min from 25 °C to 150 °C,

then cooled down to −40 °C, and then heated again to 250 °C. To investigate crystallinity of the TFF

220

formulations, samples were heated from 25 °C to 350 °C with a heating ramp rate of 5 °C/min. The

221

scans were performed with a modulation period of 60 s and a modulated amplitude of 1 °C. Dry

222

nitrogen gas at a flow rate of 50 mL/min was used to purge the DSC cell throughout the analysis.

223

Data were processed by TA Instruments Trios V.5.1.1.46572 software.

224

2.7

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

225

Scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss Supra 40 C SEM, Carl Zeiss, Heidenheim an der Brenz,

226

Germany) was used to identify surface particle morphology of the TFF remdesivir powder

227

formulations. A small amount from each of the powder formulations was placed on a carbon tape. A

228

sputter coater was used to coat all samples with 15 nm of 60/40 Pd/Pt before capturing the images.

spectra were obtained using a Varian® NMR 400 MHz Spectrometer (Agilent Inc.,

231

Palo Alto, CA, USA) at 25 °C and were used to confirm the purity of remdesivir in the TFF powders,

232

and to study interactions between excipients and remdesivir of TFF powders. Formulations F7, F8,

233

F9, F10, F14 and unprocessed L-leucine and remdesivir drug substance were dissolved in dimethyl

234

sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6). Solutions were then transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR data

235

acquisition. Chemical shifts were referenced to a residual solvent, DMSO, at 2.50 ppm. The NMR

236

spectrum peaks of remdesivir in the formulations produced by TFF were compared to those of

remdesivir unprocessed powder as received from the vendor. Excipients peaks in TFF-remdesivir

238

powders were also compared to those of unprocessed excipients.

2.9

Dissolution test

240

Simulated lung fluid (SLF) was used as a dissolution medium. SLF contained

241

dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol, albumin, transferrin, ascorbic acid and Hank’s

242

balanced salt solution (HBSS). The SLF was prepared by two steps including a preparation of

243

liposomal dispersion and freeze drying. In the first step, a liposomal dispersion was prepared by

244

mixing 2.12 mL of 25 mg/mL DPPC and 5 L of 200 mg/mL cholesterol in chloroform. Then, the

245

solution was dried using an evaporator until the dry film was obtained. The thin film of lipid was

246

dispersed by adding 8 mL of 57 mg/mL bovine serum albumin in water, 1 mL of 15 mg/mL transferrin

247

in water, and 88.5 µL of 10 mM ascorbate solution. The mixture was sonicated until it fully dispersed.

248

The dispersion was adjusted to 10 mL by adding 1M HBSS). The dispersion was frozen at -20 C for

249

6 hours, and primary dried in the lyophilizer at -40 C for 30 hours and ramp to 25 C for 12 hours

250

and finally secondary dried at 25 C for 20 hours. The lyophilized SLF was stored at 2-8 C and

251

reconstituted with purified water upon dissolution testing.

252

Dissolution testing of F10, F11, F12, F13, F14 and unprocessed crystalline remdesivir was

253

performed under sink conditions in SLF. An NGI (MSP Corp, Shoreview, MN) connected to a High

254

Capacity Pump (model HCP5, Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK) and a Critical Flow Controller

255

(model TPK 2000, Copley Scientific, Nottingham, UK) was used to load aerosolized powder. Three

256

24 mm diameter filter papers were placed on stage 4 on the NGI to capture aerosolized powder to be

257

used in the dissolution test. The transwell systems were modified as described in Rohrschneider et

258

al. The filter papers were loaded in the donor compartment of the modified transwell systems.

259

Reconstituted SLF was heated up to 37 C before loading 1.5 mL in the six-well plate. The experiment

260

was initiated after placing the donor compartment in the plate and adding 0.1 mL of SLF onto the filter

261

papers. The modified transwell systems was placed on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm and 37 C.

262

Samples of 0.1 mL were collected at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 540 mins.

263

Samples were centrifuged and diluted with DMSO/acetonitrile (10/90) to separate proteins in SLF.

264

Supernatants were collected and analyzed by HPLC as described in section 2.3. Removed volumes

were refilled with fresh SLF to maintain the dissolution volume. At the last time point, the filter

266

membranes were removed and washed with DMSO/acetonitrile (10/90) to analyze the amount of

267

undissolved drug.

268

2.10 Stability study

269

TFF powder of F10, F12 and F13 was transferred to a borosilicate glass vial. The vials were

270

dried in a lyophilizer at 25 C and 100 mTorr for 6 h, then backfilled with nitrogen gas before stoppering

271

inside the lyophilizer. The vials were sealed with aluminum caps before packing in an aluminum foil

272

bag with a desiccant. All samples were stored at 25 C/60%RH. After one month, samples were

273

collected and analyzed to determine physical stability and chemical stability. Additionally, samples

274

were analyzed to determine aerosol performance.

275

2.11 In vivo pharmacokinetic study

276

2.11.1 Single-dose dry powder insufflation

277

In vivo pharmacokinetic study was conducted using Sprague–Dawley rats in compliance with

278

the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; Protocol Number AUP-2019-00253)

279

guidelines at The University of Texas at Austin. Rats weighing 200 to 250 g (average weight of 214.3

280

g) were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle with access to food and water ad libitum and were subjected

281

to one week of acclimation time to the housing environment.

282

Intratracheal administration was carried out using the dry powder insufflator (DP-4M model,

283

Penn-Century Inc., Philadelphia, PA) connected to the air pump (AP-1 model, Penn-Century Inc.,

284

Philadelphia, PA). TFF powder was passed through a No. 325 sieve (45 m aperture) to break down

285

large aggregates. TFF remdesivir F10 and F13 were given to 5 rats per group. A precisely weighed

286

quantity of sieved TFF powder was introduced into the sample chamber of the insufflator device. The

287

dose was targeted at 10 mg/kg. Each rat was placed on its back at a 45  angle, and its incisors were

288

secured with a rubber band. A laryngoscope was used to visualize the trachea and insert the

289

insufflator device into the trachea. The sieved TFF powder was actuated into the lung using 3-5

290

pumps (200 L of air per pump). The mass of powder delivered was measured by weighing the

291

chamber before and after dose actuations.

292

Following insufflation, whole blood was collected at each time point (5, 15, 30, 2, 4, 8, and 24

293

hours) by cardiac puncture into heparinized vials. The blood samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm

294

for 3 mins to obtain plasma. Lung were harvested after collecting blood at the last time point. Plasma

295

samples and lungs were frozen and stored at -20 C until analysis.

296

2.11.2 Analysis of remdesivir and its metabolites in plasma and lung tissue

297

Plasma samples were prepared by combining 100 μL of plasma with 100 μL of methanol that

298

contained 100 ng/mL of the heavy labeled internal standards for remdesivir and GS-441524, followed

299

by vortexing and centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was placed in a 96 well

300

plate for LC/MS/MS analysis.

301

Lung tissue samples were cut in small pieces, added into a 2 mL tube with 3.5 g of 2.3 mm

302

zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Producs, Bartlesville, OK), and homogenized at 4800 rpm for 20

303

seconds. After homogenization, 1000 μL of methanol, containing 100 ng/mL internal standards for

304

remdesivir and GS-441524 was added to the tube, and the tube was vortexed and centrifuged at

305

12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was placed in a 96 well plate for LC/MS/MS analysis.

306

Calibration standards were prepared for plasma and lung tissue in the same fashion, spiking

307

remdesivir and GS-441524 standard solutions into the blank plasma and lung tissue to obtain matrix

308

matched calibrations. The calibration range was 0.1 ‒ 1000 ng/ml for plasma and 50 ‒ 10,000 ng/ml

309

for lung tissue. The calibration range was chosen to bracket sample levels measured.

310

Remdesivir and GS-441524 were separated on an Agilent Poroshell column (2.1 x 50 mm, 2.7

311

μm) (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using a gradient of 0 to 90.25% of acetonitrile with 0.025%

312

trifluoroacetic acid in 5 minutes at a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min, and the column temperature of 40°C.

313

10 μL of each sample was injected to analyze with an Agilent 6470 triple quadrupole LC/MS/MS

314

system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).

315

2.11.3 Pharmacokinetic analysis

Results

324

3.1

Physical properties of TFF remdesivir

325

The particle morphology of TFF remdesivir powder formulations containing different drug

326

loading concentrations and different excipients was determined using SEM. All formulations exhibited

327

a brittle matrix structure of highly porous particles (Figure 1). For acetonitrile/water solvent system,

328

Captisol®- and leucine-based formulations containing the same drug loading showed relatively

329

smaller nanostructure aggregates, compared to mannitol- and lactose-based formulations. Different

330

cosolvent systems resulted in different brittle matrix powder morphologies as observed by SEM. At

331

the same drug load, mixture prepared from 1,4-dioxane/water produced smaller nanostructure

332

aggregates, compared to an equivalent mixture prepared from acetonitrile/water (Figure 1B).

337

Figure 2 shows the x-ray diffraction patterns of TFF remdesivir powder formulations. No sharp

338

peaks of remdesivir were observed in any of formulations indicating remdesivir was amorphous after

339

the TFF process. The drug loading and type of co-solvent did not affect the morphology of remdesivir.

340

For excipients, sharp peaks of mannitol (13.5, 17, 18.5, 20.2,21, 22, 24.5, 25, 27.5, and 36 degree

341

two-theta) were observed in F3, F7 and F11, indicating that mannitol in these formulations remained

342

crystalline as a mixture of  and  form [31]. Similarly, some peaks of leucine (6 and 19 degree two-

343

theta) were observed in the TFF remdesivir – leucine formulations, F5, F9, F13, and F20, indicating

344

that leucine remained crystalline after the process. In contrast, Captisol® and lactose in the

345

compositions were amorphous after the TFF process.

mDSC was employed to identify the glass-forming ability of remdesivir and determine the

glass transition temperature (Tg) of remdesivir in each formulation. Figure 3A shows a mDSC

355

glass transition temperature of remdesivir was about 60 °C. No recrystallization peak was observed

356

in any cycle.

357

Figure 3B shows the physical state of remdesivir and excipients. Despite the different

358

formulation compositions, no melting peak of remdesivir was observed in any formulations, it

359

remained amorphous. These results agree with XRD diffractograms showing that remdesivir was

360

amorphous after the TFF process. The mDSC thermograms showed that the Tg of remdesivir in all

361

formulations was in the range 56-61 °C. Captisol® in both F6 and F9 showed no endothermic peaks,

362

demonstrating that Captisol® was in amorphous form. Endothermic peak of mannitol in F7 and F11

363

was observed at ~165 °C and ~160 °C, respectively, indicating mannitol was crystalline after TFF

364

process. For lactose-based formulations, two glass transition temperatures were observed, including

365

Tg of remdesivir (~59 °C) and Tg of lactose (~117 °C), indicating lactose and remdesivir were not

366

molecularly miscible. For leucine-based formulations, an endothermic peak was observed in F9 and

367

F13 at ~227 °C and ~203 °C, respectively, which are not identical with the melting peak of

368

unprocessed leucine (~300 °C) [32]. Therefore, the melting point depression of leucine can be

369

attributed to an interaction of remdesivir and leucine.

3.2

Aerodynamic properties of TFF remdesivir

374

The aerodynamic particle size distribution of TFF remdesivir formulations was evaluated

375

using a Plastiape® RS00 high resistance DPI and NGI apparatus. Figure 4 and Table 2 show

376

aerodynamic diameter distribution and aerosol performance of TFF remdesivir formulations,

377

respectively. In vitro aerodynamic testing revealed that drug loading affected the aerosol performance

378

of the TFF formulations. Despite using different excipients, the aerosol performance generally

379

increased as the drug loading was increased. The FPF (of recovered dose) of Captisol®-based

380

formulations containing 5%, 20%, 50% and 80% of remdesivir (F1, F2, F6, F10, respectively) were

381

30.73  1.11%, 45.84  6.03%, 65.19  1.18% and 68.29%, respectively. The MMAD of these TFF

382

remdesivir powder formulations was 3.10  0.04 µm, 2.59  0.15 µm, 2.22  0.14 µm, and 2.16 

383

0.21µm, respectively. For lactose- and mannitol-based formulations, there were significant increases

384

in FPF (of recovered dose) when the drug loading was increased from 20% to 50%; however, FPF

385

did not significantly change when the drug loading was increased further from 50% to 80% with these

386

materials. Interestingly, FPFs of leucine-based formulations containing 20%, 50% and 80% of

387

remdesivir were not significantly different. However, MMADs of these leucine-based formulations at

388

drug loadings of 20%, 50% and 80% increased from 0.74  0.06 µm to 0.82  0.07 µm to 1.45  0.07

389

µm, respectively. When the drug loading was increased to 100% (i.e., excipient free), F14 exhibited

390

an FPF of 62.33% (of recovered drug) and an MMAD of 2.06 µm.

391

An effect of the excipient on aerosol performance was also observed. At the same drug

392

loading, leucine-based formulations exhibited significantly greater FPF (81-85% FPF), and smaller

393

MMAD (0.7‒1.5 µm), compared to other excipients, which indicates that leucine has distinct

394

advantages over other compositions in terms of aerosol performance.

395

We also investigated the effect of co-solvent mixture and solid content on the aerosol

396

performance of the formulations. For 100% drug loading (i.e., no excipient present in composition),

397

significant differences in MMAD, FPF, and EF were observed between the formulations prepared

398

from the acetonitrile/water (F14) and a 1,4-dioxane/water (F15 and F16) co-solvent systems. F15 and

399

F16 exhibited smaller MMAD, larger FPF and EF, compared to F14. Comparing the formulations

400

prepared in the same solvent system, F16 showed better aerosol performance although it was

401

prepared at higher solid content.

402

Similar trends were observed in the Captisol®, mannitol, lactose, and leucine-based

403

formulations. Captisol®, mannitol, lactose, and leucine-based formulations that were prepared in a

404

1,4-dioxane/water co-solvent (F17, F18, F19, F20, respectively) showed smaller MMAD, compared

405

to the same compositions prepared in an acetonitrile/water cosolvent system (F10, F11, F12 and F13,

406

respectively).

Interactions between TFF remdesivir and excipients

417

1H-NMR was performed to identify interactions between remdesivir and excipients. Figure 5B

418

demonstrates an expansion of 1H-NMR spectra for selected TFF remdesivir powder formulations and

419

remdesivir unprocessed powder. While the peak at 6.03 ppm is sharp and does not show any

420

differences from the presented samples, the peaks at 5.37 and 6.33 ppm of F9 exhibited broader

421

peak. Also, these peaks were slightly shifted to downfield. Figure 5C shows an expansion of 1H-NMR

422

spectra of F9 and leucine unprocessed powder. The peak at 3.09 ppm of leucine was also shifted

423

downfield to 3.13 ppm in F9. These results indicate that remdesivir and leucine form interactions

424

during the TFF process.

3.4.1 Chemical stability of TFF remdesivir compositions

Stability study of TFF remdesivir

427

Chemical stability of remdesivir after TFF processing was confirmed by 1H-NMR. Figure 5A

428

presents the 1H-NMR spectra of selected TFF remdesivir powder formulations and remdesivir

429

unprocessed powder. Remdesivir peaks from the TFF remdesivir powder formulations consisting of

430

50% (w/w) remdesivir with mannitol, lactose, and leucine (F7, F8, and F9, respectively) are identical

431

to the peaks of remdesivir unprocessed powder. The 80% (w/w) remdesivir with Captisol® (F10) and

432

100% remdesivir without excipient (F14) powders also presented indistinguishable peaks

433

corresponding to remdesivir.

434

conditions used in the TFF process affected the chemical stability of remdesivir.

Therefore, neither the aqueous-organic cosolvent mixture nor the

435

After one-month storage at 25 °C/60% RH, samples were analyzed for chemical stability by

436

NMR and HPLC. NMR spectra demonstrated that no chemical shift of remdesivir peaks and no new

437

peaks were observed in F10, F12 and F13. Additionally, no degradant peak was observed in the

438

HPLC chromatograms (data not shown), which agrees with NMR spectra. Both analyses indicated

439

that remdesivir was chemically stable without degradation after storage.

C/60%RH. Overall, MMAD and FPF (of recovered dose) of F10, F12, and F13 was in the range of

460

1-2 m and 74-83%, respectively (Table 3). Although MMAD was slightly decreased in all three

formulations, there was no significant change in aerosol performance after one-month storage at 25

In vivo pharmacokinetic study

478

The plasma concentration-time profiles of remdesivir and GS-441524 following a single

479

inhalation dose of TFF remdesivir formulations are shown in Figures 9A and 9B, respectively.

480

Remdesivir was detected in plasma at 5 min (0.068 ng/mL) and reached a maximum 30 min (1.149

481

ng/mL) following pulmonary dosing of F10. A much smaller amount of remdesivir (< 0.01 ng/mL) was

482

detected at 5 and 15 mins following pulmonary dosing of F13. Remdesivir concentrations were below

483

the lower limit of quantitation in plasma after 2 hours and after 30 minutes following pulmonary dosing

484

of F10 and F13, respectively.

485

Figure 9B shows a comparison of plasma GS-441524 concentration-time profile from F10

486

and F13, and the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters following pulmonary administration are

487

presented in Table 4. The plasma GS-441524 profiles following pulmonary dosing of F10 and F13

488

has peak concentrations (Cmax) of 220.4 ± 118.0 ng/mL at 2 hours and 264.3 ± 88.5 ng/mL at 4 hours,

489

respectively, before plasma concentrations started decreasing. AUC0-24 and AUCinf of F13 were

significantly greater than those of F10 (p<0.05).

Thin film freezing produces high potency remdesivir dry powders for inhalation with

high aerosol performance

508

We investigated the feasibility of using the thin film freezing process to prepare inhalable

509

remdesivir powder formulations. Different excipients including Captisol®, mannitol, lactose, and

510

leucine were evaluated in this study. Mannitol and lactose are presently contained in FDA approved

511

inhalation dosage forms, while leucine has gained recent interest for pulmonary delivery and is being

512

used in an inhaled product in FDA clinical trials [33-35]. Captisol® was selected in this study since it

513

is a solubilizer used in both the solution concentrate for dilution and infusion and the lyophilized

514

powder for reconstitution/dilution and infusion of current remdesivir products [3].

515

The RS00 high resistance monodose DPI is a capsule-based DPI device that is available for

516

commercial product development, and it functions to disperse the powder based on impaction force.

517

A previous study confirmed that this impact-based DPI can disperse low-density brittle matrix powders

518

made by TFF process into respirable particles better than a shear-based DPI (e.g., Handihaler®) [36].

519

Another study also evaluated the performance of different models of the monodose DPI (RS01 and

520

RS00) on the aerosol performance of brittle matrix powders containing voriconazole nanoaggregates

521

prepared by TFF [37]. It was shown that the RS00 device exhibited better powder shearing and

522

deaggregation through smaller holes of the capsule created by the piercing system of the RS00

523

device [37]. Therefore, the RS00 high resistance Plastiape® DPI was selected for this study.

524

We found that excipient type and drug loading affect the aerosol performance of TFF

525

remdesivir powder compositions. Overall, the aerosol performance of TFF remdesivir powders

526

increased as the drug loading was increased, a highly desirable feature. This trend is obvious for the

527

Captisol®-, lactose-, and mannitol-based formulations when the drug loading was increased from 20%

528

to 50%. Furthermore, high potency TFF remdesivir powder without excipients (F14 and F15) also

529

exhibited high FPF and small MMAD, which indicates remdesivir itself has a good dispersing ability

530

without the need of a dispersing excipient when prepared using the TFF process. This shows that the

531

TFF technology can be used to minimize the need of excipient(s) in the formulation, thus maximizing

532

the amount of remdesivir being delivered to the lungs by dry powder inhalation.

533

The aerosol performance of the leucine-based formulations did not significantly change when

534

the drug loading was increased from 20% to 80%, and these formulations exhibited superior aerosol

535

performance compared to the other excipient-based formulations studied in this paper. This is likely

536

attributed to the surface modifying properties of leucine. Several papers report that leucine can

537

minimize the contact area and distance between particles [38, 39]. This decreases Van der Waal

538

forces between drug particles and subsequently increases aerosol performance.

539

Additionally, different co-solvent systems affected the aerosol performance of TFF remdesivir

540

powders. The formulations, except for the TFF remdesivir-leucine, prepared in a 1,4-dioxane/water

541

co-solvent system exhibited smaller MMAD and higher FPF than the formulations prepared in an

542

acetonitrile/water co-solvent system. Interestingly, the co-solvent systems did not affect the aerosol

543

performance of the TFF remdesivir-leucine formulation. This agrees with SEM figures showing that

544

the formulations prepared in a 1,4-dioxane/water co-solvent system has smaller nanostructured

545

aggregates than the formulations prepared in an acetonitrile/water cosolvent system. This may be

546

due to the difference in viscosity of the solvent system. The viscosity of ACN/water (50/50 v/v) was

547

lower than that of 1,4-dioxane/water (50/50 v/v) (0.81 vs. 1.62 mPa·s) [40, 41]. Our results agree with

548

previous studies by Beinborn et al. [42] and Moon et al. [37] showing that the viscosity of the solvent

549

system has an impact on the aerosol performance of TFF powder. The higher viscosity of the co-

550

solvent minimizes the movement of molecules during the ultra-rapid freezing step, resulting in more

551

homogenous distribution in the frozen state [37]. On the contrary, the lower-viscosity solvent allows

552

molecules to move more readily, which increases the chance of molecular aggregation and

553

subsequently decreases the aerosol performance [37].

554

4.2

Physical and chemical stability of remdesivir dry powder produced using TFF

555

Both XRD diffractograms and DSC thermograms showed that remdesivir was amorphous

556

after the TFF process. An amorphous form of the drug generally provides for faster dissolution rate

557

than its crystalline form. Since the drug needs to be absorbed and then penetrate through the cell

558

membrane before it is hydrolyzed to nucleoside monophosphate GS-441524, TFF remdesivir

559

powders provide benefits for the dissolution of the deposited powder in the lung fluid that leads to

560

improvement in the bioavailability and efficacy of the drug when administered by inhalation.

561

One potential concern related to the amorphous drug is physical instability due to its high

562

energy state. According to criteria described by Wyttenbach et al., our study confirmed that remdesivir

563

is categorized as a class III glass-forming drug (i.e., it is a stable glass former) [43], because no

564

crystallization peak was observed in both the cooling and heating cycles on DSC. It was reported that

565

the glass forming ability (GFA) has an influence on the physical stability of drug [44]. The GFA class

566

III drugs have a strong tendency to transform into its amorphous state, resulting in the highest physical

567

stability compared to class I and class II APIs [44, 45].

568

Additionally, NMR spectra demonstrated that Captisol® and leucine have interactions with

569

remdesivir, which may help to stabilize remdesivir during storage. Also, DSC thermograms indicated

570

that lactose and remdesivir were not molecularly dispersed in one single amorphous phase. To

571

investigate an effect of drug and excipient interaction on physical and chemical stability, we selected

572

F10, F12 and F13 in the stability study.

573

We found that the properties of a class III glass-forming drug agree with the physical stability

574

of remdesivir. After one-month storage at 25oC/60% RH, the results showed remdesivir in all three

575

formulations was physically stable. Different types of excipients did not affect the physical stability of

remdesivir. Even though lactose was not molecularly dispersed with remdesivir, it’s use did not affect

577

the physical stability of remdesivir. Lastly, these results indicate that amorphous remdesivir was

578

physically stable without a stabilizer.

579

In addition to the physical stability, remdesivir, as a prodrug, is prone to degrade by hydrolysis

580

in aqueous solution. Since an organic/water co-solvent system is required to dissolve the drug and

581

excipients in the TFF process, chemical stability is another concern during preparation. NMR spectra

582

demonstrated that remdesivir did not chemically degrade as a result of the TFF process. Even though

583

remdesivir was exposed to binary co-solvent systems consisting of water during the process, the

584

entire TFF process used to produce remdesivir dry powder inhalation formulations did not induce

585

chemical degradation of the parent prodrug. Furthermore, remdesivir was chemically stable by HPLC

586

(data not shown) and NMR after one-month storage at 25C/60%RH.

GS-441524 in the lungs.

Remdesivir in TFF powder compositions can be dissolved, absorbed and metabolized to

589

Since remdesivir is a poorly water-soluble drug, its dissolution may be a critical factor of drug

590

release in the lung fluid, especially in high drug load formulations. Undissolved particles can be

591

cleared by mucociliary clearance or macrophage uptake, causing lower drug concentration, lung

592

irritation, and inflammatory response [46]. Therefore, a dissolution test was evaluated in this study.

593

The dissolution profile demonstrated that physical form of drug appears to have a significant effect

594

on the dissolution rate. Amorphous remdesivir prepared using TFF had a much faster dissolution rate

595

in simulated lung fluid as compared to crystalline remdesivir. Moreover, the high porosity and high

596

surface area of the TFF powders also contribute to faster wetting, thereby enhancing the dissolution

597

rate [30, 47].

598

The presence of excipients also affected the dissolution rate of remdesivir. The dissolution

599

rate of 100% drug load formulation (i.e., no excipient was used), even though it is amorphous, was

600

slower, compared to 80% drug loading formulations. The enhancement of dissolution rate is likely

601

attributed to improved wetting from the use of excipients. Lactose and mannitol are hydrophilic

602

carriers that can wet the powder formulations rapidly, promoting faster exposure of the drug particles

603

to the dissolution medium [48]. In the case of Captisol®, cyclodextrins and their derivatives have been

604

widely used as solubility and dissolution modifying excipients. In our study, the molar ratio of

605

remdesivir to Captisol® in the high drug load composition (80/20 w/w) was 10:1, meaning that only

606

about 10% of remdesivir was present in a complex with Captisol® in the solubilized form, the

607

remaining remdesivir was not complexed with Captisol® and was present as amorphous powder in

608

the matrix. It is known that certain drugs form a complex with Captisol® by hydrophobic interactions

609

[15-17]. The inclusion complexation between cyclodextrin and drug can increase the aqueous

610

solubility of drug, and increase the dissolution rate [49]. It was previously reported that the solubility

611

of remdesivir can be increased by Captisol®, and Veklury®, the commercial product containing

612

remdesivir, includes Captisol® to solubilize remdesivir for the IV solution formulation [15]. Interestingly,

613

the TFF leucine-based formulation exhibited a higher dissolution rate than the TFF remdesivir

614

formulations that contain mannitol or lactose, despite its hydrophobic properties. The faster

615

dissolution rate of the leucine-based formulation is likely attributed to interactions (e.g., hydrogen

616

bonding) between remdesivir and leucine. Peaks corresponding to acidic protons (-‒OH or -‒NH) of

617

remdesivir from F9, a leucine-based formulation, became broader than those from the other

618

formulations without leucine, and shifted downfield. These wider peaks result from inter-molecular

619

interactions [50]. A peak shift in NMR spectra indicates magnetic field changes. The downfield shift

620

of the acidic protons from F9 is caused by deshielded proton, reduced electron density, indicating

621

hydrogen bonding at the protons [51, 52]. Along with a leucine corresponding peak shift from F9, it

622

was concluded that remdesivir favorably interacts with leucine in hydrogen bonding. The molar ratio

623

of remdesivir to leucine of the high drug load TFF compositions (80/20 w/w) was 1:1.5, meaning that

624

leucine in this composition was in excess in terms of its ability to interact with remdesivir. Similarly,

625

leucine interactions have been reported in Mangal’s study to enhance the solubility of azithromycin

626

[53]. Specifically, leucine formed a complex with azithromycin through hydrogen bonding [53].

627

Generally, even though leucine is a hydrophobic amino acid, it is a water-soluble excipient that has

628

higher solubility than poorly water-soluble drugs like remdesivir. Therefore, the interactions between

629

drug and leucine at the molecular level can increase the dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble drug

630

[53, 54], like that observed in our study .

631

Significantly higher plasma levels of GS-441524 than remdesivir were observed in our rat

632

pharmacokinetic study. The half-life of remdesivir is reportedly much shorter than that of GS-441524.

633

While half-life of GS-441524 is approximately 24.5 hours, for remdesivir it is only about 1 hour in

634

humans following multiple once-daily IV administrations [3]. In rats, the half-life of remdesivir in

635

plasma is reported to be less than 0.9 minute, which is much shorter than that in humans, due to

636

higher esterase activity in rodent plasma [3]. Therefore, with a Tmax of 30 minutes and a level of

637

remdesivir in plasma that is lower than the detection limit at 2 hours, F10 presented an initial rapid

638

systemic absorption of remdesivir that was complete at less than 2 hours. Tmax of GS-441524 plasma

639

concentration (2 hours) also supports this observation. In comparison, remdesivir plasma

640

concentrations of F13 were lower than those of F10 at 5 and 15 minutes, and it was lower than the

641

detection limit at the other time points, indicating that the initial systemic absorption of remdesivir from

642

lung was much slower with F13. With the later Tmax of GS-441524 plasma concentration, however,

643

more sustained release of remdesivir from lung to plasma was observed.

644

The initial faster systemic absorption of F10 from the lungs is likely due to the fact that F10

645

contains about 10% remdesivir (on a molar basis) that is complexed with Captisol® in a solubilized

646

form. Higher concentrations of both remdesivir and GS-441524 were detected in plasma following

647

administration of F10, which contains 20% w/w of Captisol®. Captisol® (i.e., sulfobutylether-β-

648

cyclodextrin), is known to enhance stability, solubility, and bioavailability of drugs [55]. When

649

Captisol® forms a complex by hydrophobic interactions with drugs, these interactions are even

650

greater than with simple physical mixtures of drug and Captisol® [16, 17]. Although F10 and F13

651

consist of amorphous remdesivir in the TFF remdesivir powder formulations, inclusion of Captisol®

652

in F10 likely increased the absorption of the complexed remdesivir into systemic circulation due to its

653

improvement in solubilization [15, 56]. Even though F10 incorporates a high molar ratio of drug to

654

Captisol® (10:1), and not all of remdesivir in F10 complexes with Captisol®, partial remdesivir-

655

Captisol® complex will still dissolve faster in lung fluid, rapidly becoming a solution and absorbed

656

faster into systemic circulation than the non-complexed remdesivir fraction with Captisol® of F10.

657

Eriksson et al. described that drugs in solution can be absorbed faster than dry powder in lungs in

658

the isolated perfused lung model [57]. Enhanced absorption of inhaled drug complexed with Captisol®

659

from lung to systemic circulation was reported in inhaled voriconazole studies. A solution form of

660

nebulized voriconazole formulation with Captisol® resulted in an 8-fold higher AUCplasma to AUClung

661

ratio as compared to nanostructured amorphous voriconazole powder formulations when delivered

662

to the lung directly (0.64 vs. 0.08 respectively) [21, 23].

663

Lastly, and related to potential use in COVID-19 therapy, the 50% maximal effective

664

concentration (EC50) value is important to evaluate antiviral efficacy of drugs. While there are studies

665

reported to evaluate remdesivir potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, only one study has

666

reported antiviral efficacy of GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2. Pruijssers et al. determined inhibition

667

of SARS-CoV-2 replication in established cell lines by GS-441524, and reported that EC50 is 0.62 μM

668

(180.6 ng/mL) in Calu3 2B4 cells, and 0.47 μM (136.9 ng/mL) in Vero E6 cells [58]. The target dose

669

of 10 mg/kg by dry powder insufflation in our rat pharmacokinetic study achieved these EC 50 values

670

necessary to reach EC50 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The plasma concentrations of GS-441524 in our

671

pharmacokinetic study also achieved higher than reported EC 50 of 0.18 μM (52.4 ng/mL) in SARS-

672

CoV-infected HAE cells [59].

Conclusions

674

We have demonstrated that low density, highly porous brittle matrix particles of remdesivir

675

powder formulations made by thin film freezing are highly aerosolizable and suitable for inhaled

676

delivery to the lung, the site of SARS-CoV-2 replication. The properties of a good glass former, like

677

remdesivir, supports that remdesivir maintains its physical stability during storage if protected from

678

moisture. The thin film freezing process is suitable to prepare remdesivir dry powder for inhalation

679

without causing chemical degradation. Dry powder administration can deliver remdesivir to the lungs,

680

which appears to be converted to its nucleoside analog GS-441524 in the lung before entering system

681

circulation based on the data showing negligible levels of remdesivir in the blood at all times for the

682

TFF-remdesivir-leucine formulation. Therefore, dry powder remdesivir for inhalation produced using

683

thin film freezing technology can provide a dry powder inhalation product for the treatment of patients

684

with COVID-19 that can be administered on an outpatient basis and earlier in the disease course
