Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has an RNA genome, which is, overall, closely
related to the bat coronavirus sequence RaTG13. However, the ACE2-binding domain of this virus
is more similar to a coronavirus isolated from a Guangdong pangolin. In addition to this unique
feature, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (and its closely related coronaviruses) has a low CpG content.
This has been postulated to be the signature of an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host
antiviral protein ZAP. Here, we analyzed the sequences of a wide range of viruses using both
alignment-based and alignment free approaches to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Our analyses revealed a high level of similarity between the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and that of the
Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. This suggests bat and pangolin coronaviruses might have
recombined at least twice (in the 5’UTR and ACE2 binding regions) to seed the formation of SARSCoV-2. An alternative hypothesis is that the lineage preceding SARS-CoV-2 is a yet to be sampled
bat coronavirus whose ACE2 binding domain and 5’UTR are distinct from other known bat
coronaviruses. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of viral genome compositions as
well as expression and RNA binding data of ZAP to show that the low CpG abundance in SARSCoV-2 is not related to an evolutionary pressure from ZAP.

Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID19 pandemic, has a single-stranded positive RNA (+ssRNA) genome of ~30kb long, which is one
of the largest known viral RNA genomes (Romano, et al. 2020). SARS-CoV-2 RNA has unique
genomic features with likely roles in the high pathogenicity and cross-species transmission of this
virus (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of 2020; Gussow,
et al. 2020). An expansive view of these genomic features is essential to improve our current
understanding of the source and evolutionary path of this virus.
So far, comparative genomic studies suggest that, overall, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to
RaTG13, which is a coronavirus isolated from a species of bat known as the intermediate
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis), in the Yunnan Province of China (Jaimes, et al. 2020; Zhou,
Chen, et al. 2020; Zhou, Yang, et al. 2020). However, the genomic region coding for the ACE2
cellular receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is an exception in that it is highly
similar to the sequence of a Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica) coronavirus found in the Guangdong
Province (Frutos, et al. 2020; Lam, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020). Both the sequence divergence
of SARS-CoV-2 genome and its unique features including a 12-base insert creating a polybasic
cleavage site, have sparked extensive debates on the origin of this new coronavirus (Andersen,
et al. 2020; Boni, et al. 2020; Frutos, et al. 2020; Lam, et al. 2020; Leitner and Kumar 2020; Xiao,
et al. 2020). Earlier studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was originated in bat, and pangolin was the
intermediate species for its leap into human (Lam, et al. 2020; Liu, et al. 2020; Wahba, et al. 2020;
Xiao, et al. 2020; Zhang, et al. 2020), However, a recent study based on phylogenetic dating
methods indicate that the origin of ACE2 binding domain in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is likely a
bat coronavirus, which is yet to be sampled (Boni, et al. 2020).
One of the unique genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 is the low abundance of CpG (di Gioacchino,
et al. 2020; Pollock, et al. 2020; Wang, et al. 2020; Xia 2020). CpG suppression is a well-known
phenomenon in viruses particularly those with RNA genomes (Karlin, et al. 1994; Rima and
McFerran 1997). It has been reported that the CpG composition of +ssRNA viral genomes often

mimics the CpG content of their hosts (Cheng, et al. 2013). This suggests host CpG manipulating
mechanisms play a role in shaping +ssRNA viral genomes during cross-species transmission.
Nevertheless, these molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. One of the suggested
mechanisms is DNA cytosine methylation-induced deamination (Bird 1980; Cheng, et al. 2013;
Alinejad-Rokny, et al. 2016). However, SARS-CoV-2 does not have a DNA stage, thus this
mechanism is not likely to be relevant. Another suggested mechanism is recognition of CpG sites
within viral RNA by the host RNA-binding protein ZAP (CCCH-type zinc finger antiviral protein)
(Xia 2020). ZAP is known to restrict viral replication by binding to the CpG rich regions of viral
RNA, and subsequently inducing viral RNA degradation (Gao, et al. 2002; Ghimire, et al. 2018).
The low CpG content of RNA viruses have been proposed to be linked to this ZAP-dependent
depletion of CpG-rich viral RNA sequences (Gao, et al. 2002; Takata, et al. 2017; Ghimire, et al.
2018). Nevertheless, ZAP, despite having a broad antiviral role, does not restrict all viruses
(Ghimire, et al. 2018).

A recent study by Xia suggested that the low CpG content of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to an
evolutionary pressure from ZAP (Xia 2020). Among the coronaviruses studied in Xia’s study, those
isolated from canines were shown to have the most CpG depleted genomes. Therefore, it was
postulated that dogs may have been the intermediate species for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, based on a previous report that ZAP identifies CpG-containing RNA (Takata, et al.
2017), Xia linked the low CpG content of SARS-CoV-2 genome to the high expression level of ZAP
in the intermediate host tissues (Xia 2020). This hypothesis is based on two assumptions, which
are not likely to be correct: first, only the frequency of CpG (but not those of other 15
dinucleotides ApA, ApC, …, TpT) is sufficient to make inferences about the origin of viruses, and
second, ZAP is the main selection force against viral CpGs. A number of follow up studies have
challenged Xia’s methodology and conclusion. For instance, Pollock et al. repeated Xia’s analysis
using a larger number of SARS-CoV-2 related viruses and found that CpG deficiency is not specific
to dog coronaviruses or SASR-CoV-2, and it is observed in pangolin coronaviruses and to a greater
extent in pangolin pestiviruses (Pollock, et al. 2020). Moreover, modeling of the binding affinity
of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in 410 vertebrates showed a low score of susceptibility to

SARS-CoV-2 infection for dogs (Damas, et al. 2020). This finding was also confirmed by viral
replication experiments (Shi, et al. 2020). Digard et al. showed that CpG abundance varies
significantly across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with envelop and ORF10 not showing CpG
depletion. They showed that the CpG levels of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 envelop sequences are even
higher than those of envelop from other human coronaviruses. Using a phylogenetic analysis, the
authors argued that these genomic composition changes are more likely to be an ancestrallydriven traits related to the origin of these viruses in bats, not due to a post-zoonotic transfer
selection force. These data suggest that the overall CpG content alone is not a reliable index for
inferring the host origin of viruses (Digard, et al. 2020).

Here, we investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 using a comparative genomic approach.
Additionally, we perform a detailed analysis of multiple data sets including the representations
of short sequence motifs in viral genomes, ZAP expression, and CpG motif preference of ZAP to
investigate the role of ZAP in reducing SARS-CoV-2 CpG level. Our analyses show that the 5’UTRs
of SARS-CoV-2 and Guangdong pangolin coronavirus (accession number EPI_ISL_410721) are
highly similar. This suggests bat and pangolin coronaviruses might have recombined at least twice
(in the 5’UTR and ACE2 binding regions) to seed the formation of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative
hypothesis is that the lineage preceding SARS-CoV-2 is a yet to be sampled bat coronavirus whose
ACE2 binding domain and 5’UTR are distinct from other known bat coronaviruses. We show that
the representation of almost all dinucleotides, not only CpG is different in SARS-CoV-2 compared
to its more distantly related coronaviruses. For example, GpC, TpC, and ApT are all represented
at significantly lower levels in the SARS-CoV-2 genome compared to the SARS-CoV genomes. Our
analyses indicate that the CpG motifs preferentially targeted by ZAP do not have a lower
representation than those not often recognized by ZAP. Altogether, our results provide multiple
lines of evidence against the role of ZAP in shaping the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

We applied principal component analysis (PCA) on motif representation (D-value) matrices to
interrogate similarities between and within virus families (Supplementary Table 1 and 2). Fig. 1A
shows the PCA of all four virus groups studied here, and Fig. 1B shows the results of the same
analysis done on coronaviruses only. As indicated in Fig. 1A, all of the four virus families HIN1,
HBV, HIV-1 and coronaviruses are separated using the first two PCs. PCA of only coronavirus
sequences is depicted in Fig. 1B. As expected, SARS-COV-2, Bat-RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV
formed a cluster (SARS-CoV-2-like group), which was separated from the rest of coronavirus
sequences, Human-SARS-CoV, Paguma-SARS-CoV, Viverridae-SARS-CoV, Paradoxurus-SARS-CoV,
Bat-SARS-CoV, Mus-SARS-CoV and Primate-SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV group). The two groups of
coronaviruses described above (shown in ovals in Fig. 1B) are clearly separated from each other,
except for three bat coronaviruses shown by black arrows (accession numbers MG772933,
MG772934 and KY352407). In the PC1-PC2 plot of Fig. 1B these three sequences are positioned
closer to the SARS-CoV-2-like group than to their own SARS-CoV group. Alignment-based
comparative genomic studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 sequences are most closely related
to the Bat-RaTG13 sequence (Zhou, Chen, et al. 2020). This is also apparent in the PC1-PC2 plot
of Fig. 1B with Bat-RaTG13 (blue dot) being the closest to the SARS-CoV-2 cluster (red dots).
Pangolin-CoV sequences (green dots) also position close to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences (Fig. 1B).
The Pangolin-CoV sequence with the accession number EPI_ISL_410721, which is labeled in
PubMed to be of Guangdong origin, is the second most closely related virus to the SARS-CoV-2
family. The remaining Pangolin-CoV sequences, which are labeled with Guangxi, form a subcluster that is located at a farther distance to the SARS-CoV-2 sequences.

5’UTR sequence similarity
To investigate the origin of SAR-CoV-2, we compared, using a moving window analysis, its
genome to the sequences of Bat-RaTG13 and two Pangolin-CoV genomes, one from Guangdong
(accession number EPI_ISL_410721), and one from Guangxi (accession number EPI_ISL_410539).
The results are shown in Fig. 2, which depicts the difference between pairwise similarities of
SARS-CoV-2/Bat-RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2/Pangolin-CoV in windows of size 20bp moving along
the sequence by 1bp. Windows within which Bat-RaTG13 sequence is more closely similar to

SARS-CoV-2 than Pangolin-CoV to SARS-CoV-2 are shown in blue vertical bars, and the opposite
is shown in red. As expected, the majority of windows are blue indicating that, overall, BatRaTG13 is the most similar virus to SARS-CoV-2. The windows indicated in red are those within
which Pangolin-CoV is more similar to SARS-CoV-2. Overall, for both Guangdong and Guangxi
sequences there are regions within which these sequences are more similar to SARS-CoV-2 (6%
and 9% of windows, red bars in Fig. 2 for Pangolin Guangxi and Guangdong, respectively).
However, there are many more windows within which SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to Bat-RaTG13
(94% and 91% of windows, blue bars in Pangolin Guangxi and Guangdong, respectively panels in
Fig. 2). The ACE2-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike is known to have a very high sequence
similarity to the same region in the Guangdong pangolin coronavirus genome (Frutos, et al. 2020;
Lam, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020). This is also indicated by two sharp red peaks in Fig. 2B and to
a lesser extent in Fig. 2A. The nucleic acid as well as amino acid sequences of these two regions
are shown in boxes above the similarity lines. Most importantly, our window analysis shows a
region within 5’UTR that is identical in SARS-CoV-2 and Guangdong pangolin coronavirus
sequences but differs in five positions between Bat-RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These
genomic positions are 19, 37, 91, 174 and 190, relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence
(accession number NC_045512). Such a high level of similarity between the Guangdong pangolin
coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 is not observed for the Guangxi pangolin coronavirus. To investigate
if the high level of similarity between the 5’UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 and Guangdong pangolin
coronavirus is also observed for other coronaviruses, we performed a multiple alignment of 505
sequences of coronaviruses from a wide range of hosts such as human, pangolin, bat, bovine,
canine, camel, and rabbit. A section of this alignment, shown in Supplementary Fig 1, indicates
that Guangdong pangolin coronavirus and SAR-CoV-2 have the most similar 5’UTRs among all
reported coronaviruses.

As indicated in Fig. 1, coronaviruses used in this study form two distinct groups (SARS-CoV-2-like
and SARS-CoV) based on their motif representations (D-values). We compared, for each
dinucleotide, the median D-values of these two groups (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 3). All
dinucleotide motifs (not only CpG) except for ApG were significantly different between the two

groups. There is an excess of ApA, TpA, GpT, TpT, ApC, CpC and GpG, and a deficit of CpA, GpA,
ApT, CpT, TpC, GpC, TpG and CpG in group one (SARS-CoV-2-like) compared to group two (SARSCoV). We then performed an additional representation analysis focusing on the trinucleotide
motifs that contain CpG (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3). Our analysis shows that the
trinucleotide profiles of the two virus groups are also different. Specifically, there is a higher
representation for CGC, CGG, CCG, and ACG and lower representation for CGA, CGT, TCG and
GCG in group one compared to group two coronaviruses.

To determine if host ZAP level has played a role in altering viral CpG levels, we investigated the
correlation between ZAP mRNA expression level and CpG motif representation in viral genomes
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 4). To ensure our analyses are physiologically relevant, we used
the ZAP expression data of common cellular/tissue reservoirs for each virus. We observed no
significant correlation between CpG motif representation and ZAP mRNA expression (R2 = 0.04,
p = 0.47, Fig. 5).

To determine the CpG motif specificity of ZAP, we overlaid the ZAP CLIP-seq data and the CpG
distribution of two viruses, HIV and JEV (Japanese Encephalitis Virus) (Fig. 6). We found no clear
and consistent pattern of co-localization between ZAP binding regions and CpG sites in HIV and
JEV genomes.

It has been shown that ZAP binds preferentially to C(n7)G(n)CG motifs (Luo, et al. 2020). To
further investigate the role of ZAP binding in reducing SARS-CoV-2 CpG level, we compared the
relative frequency of C(n7)G(n)CG in group one (SARS-CoV-2-like) and group two (SARS-CoV)
viruses (Supplementary Table 5). In spite of CpG reduction in SARS-CoV-2 genome, the ZAP
preferred motif C(n7)G(n)CG, is more abundant in the SARS-CoV-2-like group (Fig. 7).

In Xia’s study, it is shown that the genome of one of the dog coronaviruses (accession number
KC175339) has a significantly higher CpG level than the rest of canine coronaviruses. The author
attributed the high CpG level of this virus to its extensive propagation in cell culture before it is

sequenced. Xia argues that lack of a selection force against CpG has led to its rebound in this virus
(Xia 2020). To test this rebounding hypothesis, we quantified the CpG motif representations of
HIV-1 lab strain IIIB (accession numbers A04321.1), which is commonly cloned and cultured in
cell lines, and compared it with the CpG representation of HIV sequences isolated from patients.
Fig. 8 indicates the distribution of CpG representations in 844 HIV-1 isolate sequences. The CpG
representation values for A04321.1 falls within the interquartile range, thus is not significantly
different from the median of this distribution.

Discussion
It is critical to determine the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and understand the changes leading to its leap
into human. This information can help prevent and/or better control future pandemics caused
by coronaviruses. Alignment-based comparative genomic studies indicate that the shoehorse bat
coronavirus Bat-RaTG13 is the most closely related virus to SARS-CoV-2. However, the ACE2
biding domain sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to that of a Guangdong pangolin
coronavirus. These results led to the conclusion, in several independent studies, that SARS-CoV2 originated via a recombination between the bat and pangolin coronaviruses (Lam, et al. 2020;
Li, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020). However, a recent study (Boni, et al. 2020) shows that
phylogenetic dating methods do not support the bat-pangolin recombination hypothesis. The
study suggests that the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is likely a coronavirus circulating in bats, but this
virus remains to be sampled.

We have previously shown that an alignment-free method that uses the representation of short
sequence motifs can precisely identify HIV-1 subtypes (Ebrahimi, et al. 2014). Here, we used the
same method to investigate the similarities between and within virus families. As indicated in Fig.
1A, this method successfully classifies different virus families. Additionally, it shows a separate
cluster for SARS-CoV-2 with Bat-RaTG13 and pangolin coronaviruses in its close proximity (see
SARS-CoV-2-like group in Fig 1B). Our method confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 sequences are closely
similar to Bat-RaTG13 (MN996532) followed by a Guangdong pangolin coronavirus
(EPI_ISL_410721). Additionally, our window analysis revealed that the 5’UTR of SARS-CoV-2 is

highly similar to the 5’UTR of Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. Altogether, our analyses indicate
that both the 5’UTR and ACE2-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 genome have either a pangolin
coronavirus origin (Lam, et al. 2020; Xiao, et al. 2020) or they have originated from an unsampled
bat coronavirus, which is more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than both RaTG13 and Guangdong
pangolin coronavirus are to SARS-CoV-2 (Boni, et al. 2020). Regardless of which hypothesis is
correct, and what coronavirus (bat or bat-pangolin recombinant) was the immediate predecessor
of SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that recombinations of both 5’UTR and ACE2 binding regions
of coronaviruses are relatively recent events in the history of SARS-CoV-2.

Our analyses confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related viruses Bat-RaTG13 and PangolinCoV have a lower CpG content compared to other viruses (Fig. 3) (di Gioacchino, et al. 2020;
Pollock, et al. 2020; Wang, et al. 2020; Xia 2020). However, we show that changes in motif
representation is not exclusive to CpG. All dinucleotides (except for ApG) have significantly
different representations in the viruses of SARS-CoV-2-like group compared to the viruses in the
SARS-CoV group (Fig. 3). Not only CpG, but also CpA, GpA, ApT, CpT, and TpC have lower
representations in SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related viruses. Additionally, ApA, TpA, TpT, GpT,
ApC, CpC, and GpG have higher representations in the viruses of SARS-CoV-2-like group. The trinucleotide profiles of these two virus groups are also totally distinct (Fig. 4). Altogether, these
data suggest that the observed differences in CpG abundance between the two virus groups is
part of a global genomic difference rather than being a signature of an exclusive selection force
against CpG motifs.

Immune evasion is one of the mechanisms proposed to explain the low CpG abundance in viral
genomes including coronavirus sequences (Shpaer and Mullins 1990; Karlin, et al. 1994;
Shackelton, et al. 2006; Woo, et al. 2007; Cheng, et al. 2013; Greenbaum, et al. 2014). Assuming
that this hypothesis is true, one would expect to observe a significant CpG depletion in the
genome of SARS-CoV-2 to justify its high transmission rate and pathogenicity. By contrast, there
is a little difference between the SARS-CoV-2-like and SARS-CoV viruses in terms of CpG
abundance. The average CpG counts per kilobase (Kb) is 14.7 and 19.3 in group one (SARS-CoV-

2-like) and group two (SARS-CoV) viruses, respectively. This means, on average, compared to
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has ~4.6 less CpGs per 1 Kb. It is unlikely that such a marginal CpG
difference plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion. Importantly, a previous study
showed no correlation between the pathogenicity and global CpG content of coronaviruses
infecting humans (di Gioacchino, et al. 2020). Furthermore, it has been shown that the CpG
content of SARS-CoV-2 sequences is highly variable across the viral genome. In some regions of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome such as envelop, not only CpG is not depleted, but it is more abundant
compared to some of the other coronaviruses. This suggests the global CpG content is unlikely to
be a vital genomic feature of SARS-CoV-2 with a possible role in immune evasion (Digard, et al.
2020). Altogether, the overall reduction of CpG level in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is likely unrelated
to the pressure imposed on the virus by the innate immune system.

Among the components of human innate immune system, ZAP has been shown to play a key role
in the inhibition of RNA viruses by binding to CpG containing sequences and recruiting a RNAdegradation machinery (Takata, et al. 2017). A recent study shows that ZAP is capable of
inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Nchioua, et al. 2020). Xia’s study postulates that the source of
SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus whose genome underwent further CpG reduction by ZAP after
the virus infected an intermediate species with a high ZAP expression level (possibly a canine
tissue). It was suggested that ZAP-induced CpG depletion of viral RNA in this intermediate species
led to the generation of SARS-CoV-2, which was able to infect human cells (Xia 2020). We tested
this hypothesis using the CpG representation data of multiple viruses and the expression data of
ZAP in tissues infected by these viruses. As indicated in Fig. 5 we observe no correlation between
the abundance of CpG in viral genomes and the ZAP mRNA level in viral reservoirs.

Further, our analyses show a poor association between the abundance of CpG across viral
genomes and the location of ZAP binding peaks (Fig. 6). These data suggest that binding of ZAP
to viral RNA is likely not governed by the global CpG abundance of viral genomes. In support of
our results, previous studies have shown that ZAP does not inhibit all viruses and its inhibition is
independent of the viral CpG content (Bick, et al. 2003). Additionally, a recent study shows that

the location and sequence context of CpGs but not the overall CpG abundance of viral genome
play a role in inducing ZAP antiviral activity (Ficarelli, et al. 2020). Moreover, one of the
mechanisms by which ZAP inhibits viruses is through the suppression of viral mRNA translation
via blocking eIF4A (Ghimire, et al. 2018). This mechanism is independent of ZAP binding to viral
RNA.
A previous study has shown that mouse ZAP preferentially binds to C(n7)G(n)CG motifs where n:
A, C, G, or U (Luo, et al. 2020). Assuming that human ZAP has the same motif preference and that
it has

induced an evolutionary pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 genome, one would expect the

relative abundance of C(n7)G(n)CG to be lower in SARS-CoV-2 compared to other coronaviruses.
Our analysis does not show a lower abundance for this motif in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. 7).
In fact SARS-CoV-2 genome has a slightly higher %C(n7)G(n)CG. This may be considered as yet
another line of evidence against the role of ZAP in lowering the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2
genome.
Xia’s study postulated that in the absence of ZAP, pressure against CpG is relieved and viruses
evolve to restore their lost CpGs (Xia 2020). We tested this hypothesis using the HIV-1 molecular
clone IIIB. Our analysis did not show a significant difference between the CpG content of HIV IIIB
and those of HIV sequences isolated from patients (Fig. 8). This suggests the abundance of CpG
motif in viral genomes is likely independent of ZAP-induced immune response in the virus
reservoir.
We note that some of the studies of the evolutionary footprint of host immune mechanisms on
viral genomes, focus merely on specific motifs, and ignore the overall composition of viral
genomes. In many cases, this can lead to gross misinterpretation of data. For example, a
phylogeny effect can be misinterpreted as an evolutionary signature. To better understand the
role of ZAP and other restriction factors in the inhibition and/or evolution of viruses, a global
analysis of viral genomic composition is needed. Differences observed in 15 out of 16
dinucleotides (i.e. not only CpG) (Fig. 3) point to general mechanism(s) with a global impact on
the overall composition of SARS-CoV-2 genome. One of these mechanisms might be oxidative

stress, although there is currently no data to support this hypothesis. Viral infection is often
associated oxidative stress, which results in producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Schwarz
1996). It has been shown that coronavirus infection causes a high level of ROS production in host
cells (Delgado-Roche and Mesta 2020). Nucleotides, particularly guanine, are more prone to the
oxidative damage caused by ROS, which oxidize guanine to 8-oxyguanine in both DNA and RNA
(Schneider, et al. 1993). 8-oxyguanine has a similar affinity for binding to adenine and cytosine
(Sekiguchi and Tsuzuki 2002). There is a possibility that during the SARS-CoV-2 replication process
(Romano, et al. 2020), which includes synthesizing a negative strand from the genome followed
by making a positive strand using the newly synthesized negative strand, G is substituted with T.
The lower representations of CpG, TpG, and GpA accompanied with higher representations of
CpT, TpT and TpA in the viruses of SARS-CoV-2-like group (Fig. 3) might be due to G>T mutations
induced by oxidative stress. Nevertheless, there is currently no data to support this hypothesis.
In summary, we performed several independent analyses to investigate similarities between
SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses and also to determine if ZAP played a role in the emergence
of this virus. We discovered a high degree of similarity between the 5’UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 and
Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. It remains to be determined if the high pathogenicity and
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is due, at least in part, to its unique 5’UTR sequence. Our analyses
find no evidence to suggest that ZAP exerts an evolutionary pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 genome
by targeting its CpG motifs. This, however, does not imply ZAP plays no role in inhibiting SARSCoV-2.

tumor virus, 9 Murine polyomavirus, 2 Papovavirus Hamster, 2 Parvovirus ADV-G, 4 Poliovirus
type 2, and 7 SIV-CPZ were analyzed. GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was used to retrieve all
14,246 viral sequences (Supplementary Table 1).

Analysis of motif representation
We quantified the representation of short sequence motifs (di- and tri-nucleotides) in all viral
genomes using our previously reported D-value method (Ebrahimi, et al. 2011, 2012). Briefly,
motif representation (D-value) is defined as the ratio of the observed frequency (Pobs) of a motif
over its expected frequency (Pexp). Pobs is simply the observed relative frequency of the motif. Pexp
is the total count of the motif in the sequence divided by the total count of all other motifs with
the same length. An example of a D-value for a tri-nucleotide sequence is given in Eq. 1.

𝐷=

𝐴𝐶𝐺𝑜𝑏𝑠
𝐴𝐶𝐺𝑒𝑥𝑝

=

𝐴𝐶𝐺𝑜𝑏𝑠 × 𝐶𝑜𝑏𝑠
𝐴𝐶𝑜𝑏𝑠 × 𝐶𝐺𝑜𝑏𝑠

Eq. 1

To demonstrate the ability of our nonalignment-based D-value method in classifying viral families
we performed principal component analysis (PCA). D-values of all dinucleotide and trinucleotide
motifs in all sequences form a matrix, which is used as an input for PCA.

We performed two separate principal component analyses. The first analysis was performed on
all coronaviruses as well as flu H1N1, HIV, and HBV sequences to determine if analysis of motif
representations can distinguish these viruses from coronaviruses. The second PCA was
performed on coronavirus sequences to identify viruses whose genome show high similarities to
the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Mann–Whitney test was used to determine the difference in the
median of D-value between these two groups of coronaviruses.

Analysis of association between CpG abundance and ZAP level
We interrogated the association between viral CpG representation (D-value) and ZC3HAV1 (ZAP)
mRNA expression level using a linear regression model. For viruses with more than one sequence
we used an average D-value in our analyses. ZC3HAV1 mRNA expression level data of common

reservoirs for Human-SARS-CoV-2, Human-SARS-CoV, Mus-SARS-CoV, Paguma-SARS-CoV, HIV1,
HIV2, H1N1, H3N2, HCV, HBV, Human bocavirus, Murine polyomavirus, Poliovirus type 2 and
MMTV viruses were obtained from FANTOM5 (Lizio, et al. 2015).

To investigate the association of ZAP binding regions in the viral genomes with the number of
CpGs co-located with these binding regions, we used the publicly available datasets of crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-seq) reported for ZAP. We obtained the processed ZAP CLIPseq data (density of reads aligned to the genome) for wild type JEV (Japanese Encephalitis Virus)
and wild type HIV (Takata, et al. 2017; Chiu, et al. 2018). We then calculated the CpG density
across the JEV and HIV genomes using a sliding window analysis method. We used 200bp window
and 1Bp sliding for JEV and 250bp window and 1Bp sliding for HIV.

The motif C(n7)G(n)CG has recently been demonstrated to be the optimal binding motif for
Mouse ZAP (Luo, et al. 2020). To further investigate the role of ZAP in reducing CpG abundance
in shaping the genome of SARS-CoV-2, we compared the relative abundance of C(n7)G(n)CG
(#C(n7)G(n)CG / #CG, reported per kilobase) in the two viral groups of SARS-CoV-2-like and SARSCoV. We used Mann–Whitney test to determine the difference between the two coronavirus
groups).

Figure 1: PCA of viral motifs representations. D-values of all dinucleotide and trinucleotide
motifs in all viral sequences form a matrix, which is used as an input for PCA. (A) PC1-PC2 plot
shows four clusters, one for each virus family: H1N1, SARS-CoV, HBV, and HIV-1. (B) PC1-PC2 plot
classifies SARS-CoV viruses into two clusters. SARS-COV-2, Bat-RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV formed
a cluster (SARS-CoV-2-like group), which is separated from the rest of coronavirus sequences
Human-SARS-CoV, Paguma-SARS-CoV, Viverridae-SARS-CoV, Paradoxurus-SARS-CoV, Bat-SARSCoV, Mus-SARS-CoV and Primate-SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV group). SARS-CoV-2-like and SARS-CoV
groups are highlighted with purple and blue circles. The three Bat-SARS-CoV sequences are
located close to the SARS-CoV-2-like group, which is shown by black arrows. Guangdong
Pangolin-CoV is shown by a broken arrow.

Figure 2: 5’UTR sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-CoV. The sequences of
Bat-RaTG13 and two Pangolin-CoV genomes, one from Guangdong (accession number
EPI_ISL_410721), and one from Guangxi (accession number EPI_ISL_410539) were compared
with the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence. A 20bp sliding window moving by 1bp was used to
quantify the difference between two pairwise similarity measures (SARS-CoV-2/Bat-RaTG13 and
SARS-CoV-2/Pangolin-CoV). Windows within which Bat-RaTG13 sequence is more closely similar
to SARS-CoV-2 than Pangolin-CoV is to SARS-CoV-2 are shown in blue vertical bars, and the
opposite is shown in red.

Paguma-SARS-CoV, Viverridae-SARS-CoV, Paradoxurus-SARS-CoV, Bat-SARS-CoV, Mus-SARS-CoV
and Primate-SARS-CoV). Mann–Whitney test was used to examine the difference in the median
