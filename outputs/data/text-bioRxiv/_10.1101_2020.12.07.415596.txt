Abstract
Infection by SARS-CoV-2 involves the attachment of the receptor binding domain
(RBD) of its spike proteins to the ACE2 receptors on the peripheral membrane of host
cells. Binding is initiated by a down to up conformational change in the spike protein,
an opening which presents the RBD to the receptor. To date, computational and experimental studies for therapeutics have concentrated, for good reason, on the RBD.
However, the RBD region is highly prone to mutations, and therefore will possibly arise
drug resistance. In contrast, we here focus on the correlations between the RBD and
residues distant to it in the spike protein. We thereby provide a deeper understanding
of the role of distant residues in the molecular mechanism of infection. Predictions
of key mutations in distant allosteric binding sites are provided, with implications for
therapeutics. Identifying these emerging mutants can also go a long way towards predesigning vaccines for future outbreaks. The model we use, based on time-independent
component analysis (tICA) and protein graph connectivity network, is able to identify
multiple residues that exhibit long-distance coupling with the RBD opening. Mutation on these residues can lead to new strains of coronavirus with different degrees of
transmissibility and virulence. The most ubiquitous D614G mutation and the A570D
mutation of the highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 variant are predicted ab-initio
from our model. Conversely, broad spectrum therapeutics like drugs and monoclonal
antibodies can be generated targeting these key distant but conserved regions of the
spike protein.

Significance statement
The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic resulted in the largest economic and public
health crises in recent times. Significant drug design effort, against SARS-CoV-2, is focused
on the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, although this region is prone
to mutations causing therapeutic resistance. We applied deep data analysis methods on allatom molecular dynamics simulations to identify key non-RBD residues that play a crucial

role in spike-receptor binding and infection. Because the non-RBD residues are typically
conserved across multiple coronaviruses, they can not only be targeted by broad spectrum
antibodies and drugs against existing strains, but can also offer predictive insights into how to
design adaptable antiviral therapeutic framework against spike of strains that might appear
during future epidemics.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic continues its spread, with more than 83 million confirmed cases
worldwide and 1.8 million deaths by the end of December 2020, according to the World
Health Organization. The etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae
family, which includes SARS-CoV-1 (2002-2004) and MERS-CoV (since 2012), viruses with
which SARS-CoV-2 has a sequence identity of 79.6% and 50%, respectively. 1,2 Expressed on
the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) protein plays a crucial role. It binds to the host
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the S protein’s receptor-binding domain
(RBD), thereby facilitating viral entry into host cells. 3,4 Therefore, the spike protein is a preponderant target for inhibitors that impede SARS-CoV-2 infection. When assessing genomic
variability of SARS-CoV-2, we are presented with a moderate mutation rate compared to
other RNA viruses, around 1.12 × 10-3 nucleotide substitution/site/year, 5 (but much larger
than DNA viruses); the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is at the same level as SARS-CoV1. 6 Significantly, the spike protein has been demonstrated to be particularly susceptible to
acquiring mutations. 5,7–9 More specifically, a study analyzing 10,022 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
from 68 countries revealed 2969 different missense variants, with 427 variants in the S protein
alone. 5 This suggests a strong propensity to form new strains with higher virulence and more
complicated epidemiology; the dominant D614G mutation and the recent B.1.1.7 mutant are
notable examples. 10 Spike protein variability can thus render currently existing therapeutic
agents ineffective in combating SARS-CoV-2 and other probable SARS epidemics in the fu-

ture. It therefore is of fundamental value to understand, in microscopic detail, the role of
spike mutations to the structural dynamics that triggers infection.
Large scale screening of therapeutic molecules and antibodies are underway, aiming to
target the spike protein and consequently to prevent infection. Most of the experimental 11–14
and computational 15–17 efforts for inhibitor design focus on the receptor binding domain
(RBD), despite the fact that this region is highly mutation-prone 18 and can cause resistance
to therapeutics. For example, the mutations in the RBD observed in the emerging viral
lineage in South Africa resulted in up to a ten-fold reduction in the neutralization capacity
of conventional antibody therapy. 19
Domains in the spike other than the RBD are also possible targets for inhibition. The
human immune system started generating antibodies specific to residues outside the RBD
even at the early stages of the pandemic. Liu et al. extracted from infected patients multiple
COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies, a fraction of which bind to non-RBD epitopes of the Sprotein, such as the N-terminal domain (NTD). 20 Moreover, a separate group of antibodies,
present in the bloodstream of uninfected humans (particularly, and importantly, in children),
were observed to bind specifically to the S2-stem region. This structure has virtually identical
sequence in all coronavirus strains, including the ones causing common cold. 21 The presence
of such universal antibodies, selective to the conserved regions of the spike, is hypothesized
to cause the absence of severe infections in children. Such observations motivate an effort
towards designing small-molecule drugs and antibodies targeted towards residues far from
the RBD in the 3D structure which, consequently, are less prone to mutation.
A number of studies explored druggable hotspots in the spike protein that modulate,
via allosteric effects, ACE2 binding. 22,23 Although this is a noteworthy approach towards
targeting non-RBD residues, the S-ACE2 bound complex once formed already can initiate
infection. So inhibitors which bind to the ACE2-bound spike are only partially effective in
preventing viral entry. We, therefore, focus our study on the effect of distant residues on
the dynamics of the structural transition in the spike protein leading to the RBD-up confor-

mation, i.e., before it becomes posed for binding (see Fig 1). This is because RBD opening
plays an obligatory role in the infection by displaying the RBD to the ACE2 receptor. Therapeutics inhibiting this structural transition can therefore prevent ACE2 binding altogether,
providing a higher degree of barrier towards the infection.

Figure 1: The RBD opening transition in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: the RBD of the
chain shown in green is undergoing the down to up transition leading to the binding to the
human ACE2 receptor.
The down-to-up transition of the S-protein RBD has been subjected to extensive cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies that elucidated the atomic resolution structures
of the closed (PDB ID: 6VXX, 24 6XR8 25 ), partially open (PDB ID: 6VSB 26 ) and fully open
(PDB ID: 6VYB 24 ) states. Attempts have been made to study the dynamics of RBD opening using force-field based classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. 27,28 But the direct
observation of an RBD opening transition is beyond the scope of atomistic MD simulation,
primarily because of the large size of the system and the long timescales involved. Yet, combining multiple short trajectories totaling up to 1.03 ms, the Folding@Home project could
resolve various intermediates of the RBD opening transition. 28 Moreover, structure-based

coarse-grained modeling could be employed to explore the conformational landscape of multiple configurations of the spike trimer (1-up-2-down, 2-up-1-down, 3-up and 3-down), 29 and,
in a separate study, to identify allosteric communication pathways in the spike protein. 18
Despite providing a qualitative insight, the absence of explicit solvent and atomistic detail,
and the exclusion of the glycan-shield ( which plays dynamic roles beyond shielding itself 27 ),
obscured a quantitative mechanistic picture of the conformational opening transition.
We took a three-pronged approach to identify the distant residues that show correlated
motion coupled to RBD opening and closing. Firstly, we obtained the underlying free energy
profile of the RBD dynamics and performed multiple short unbiased simulations representing different regions of the configuration space. Secondly, we designed and employed a novel
way to identify residues important for the conformational change by quantifying the correlation of the backbone torsion angles of the protein with the slowest degrees of freedom
representing the down-to-up transition of the RBD. Thirdly, we took an alternative route
to study allosteric connections by constructing a dynamical network model that uses the
mutual information metric computed from MD trajectories. Taken together, the three approaches resulted in the prediction of a handful of residues in specific regions of the S protein
that play a crucial role in the conformational rearrangements of the spike. These residues
suggest possible future mutational hotspots, as well as targets for designing inhibitors that
can reduce the flexibility of the RBD, leading to reduced receptor binding capability. In fact,
the most ubiquitous spike protein mutation to date, the D614G, 30 and the A570D mutation
in the recently emerged highly contagious UK SARS-CoV-2 strain, 31 both appear among our
predicted set of residues, the latter being discovered after the completion of our calculations.

Results
Correlation between RBD-opening and backbone dihedral angle
Multiple unbiased trajectories were propagated from different regions of the S-protein RBDopening conformational space, priorly explored by steered MD and umbrella sampling (details in Supporting Information (SI) Appendix ). Three of those trajectories were assigned
as the closed, partially open, and fully open state, based on the position of free energy minima along the umbrella sampling reaction coordinate (cf. SI Appendix). The stability of
these three conformations were ensured by inspection of the trajectories. The cumulative
simulation data was projected onto a feature space composed of pairwise distances between
residues from RBD and from other parts of the spike near the RBD (details in SI Appendix);
these distances increase during the down to up transition. The projected trajectory data
was subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) 32 and time-independent component
analysis (tICA). 33,34 The former method calculates the degrees of freedom with the highest
variance in the system, while the latter obtains the ones with the longest timescale. These
methods quantify large conformation changes in complex bio-molecules. The goal of performing PCA and tICA is to find out one or two coordinates which best describe the RBD
opening motion. As one continuous trajectory hardly samples the transition event, multiple
short trajectories spanning a large range of the configuration space were used. 35
The first principal component (PC) and the first time-independent component (tIC),
obtained from PCA and, respectively, from tICA analysis could both distinguish the closed
and open states, although the partially open and fully open states could not be distinguished
within the first two PCs. Yet, the projections of the open- and closed-state trajectories
along the first two principal components are in agreement with the results of previous long
multi-microsecond spike protein simulations. 27 Because of the clear distinction between the
closed, open and the intermediate, partially open states (Fig. 2b), we chose the first two
time-independent components (tICs) for our subsequent analysis.

Large scale conformational changes in proteins are, at a fundamental level, stemming
from complex combinations of transitions between various states of the protein-backbone
torsional angles φ and ψ. These combinations add up to global displacements, which set the
timescale for internal friction 36 and gauge the paradoxically large number of conformational
states accessible to a protein as it folds. 37 On one hand, concerted transitions of the backbone
torsions typically lead to large scale motion. On the other hand, exponential divergence in
nonlinear dynamical systems 38 is such that only certain dihedrals are likely to predominantly
effect the conformational changes. We therefore hypothesize that there exist specific residues
in the spike protein, for which the transition in backbone dihedral states result in the opening
of the RBD. Moreover, we conjecture that, given the significant mutation rate, and because
of the selection pressure on the virus, the residues with large impact in collective motions
that facilitate infectivity are likely to be selected in spike mutants. To test this hypothesis
we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients of the sines and cosines of all the φ and
ψ backbone torsion angles of all the residues with the first two tICs. The magnitude of the
correlation is found to be significantly large only for a handful of torsion angles, whereas the
majority show near-zero correlation (Fig. 2c).
We sorted the sines and cosines of the torsion angles in increasing order of the correlation
coefficient for both the tICA components, this resulted in four ordered lists, depicted in Fig.
2 c. (See data availability statement to access the complete lists). We then selected the ten
largest positively and negatively correlated residues from each list, adding up to 80 residues
with multiple repetitions. Table 1 shows residues with the highest number of occurrences
in the list of the top 80 angles. The list is dominated by pairs of consecutive residues,
with ψ of the first and the φ of the second residue. This suggests that two consecutive
torsion angles in certain regions of the protein are highest correlated with the RBD opening
motion. This correlation does not exclude causation, since change in the conformational
state for two subsequent torsion angles can induce crankshaft motion 39 in the backbone
which, propagating along the chains, leads to a change in protein structure.

The distribution of some of these dihedral angles for the highest correlated residues, in
the closed, open and partially open state, are depicted in Fig. 2d. Similar plots for all 80
angles are in the SI Appendix. Most dihedrals belonged to residues in the loop structure
joining the RBD with the S2 stem, as this region is a hinge for the opening of the RBD. The
angles could distinguish one or both of the open states from the RBD-down configuration.
Primarily, the closed and fully open states shared a similar region in the dihedral angle
space different from the partially open structure. We do consider the caveat that the fully
open state, generated from the closed state using steered molecular dynamics and umbrella
sampling (see SI Appendix), is an approximation for a more exact RBD up structure that
binds the ACE2 receptor. Yet, the fact, that the highly correlated residues follow a distinctly
different distribution in the backbone torsion angle space, indicates that a handful of nonRBD residues can play a pertinent role in the conformational change of the spike and,
consequently, in the viral infection. Interestingly, the correlated torsion angles span over
all three chains of the spike trimer, namely A (the one undergoing the RBD transition), B
and C, hinting at the potential role of inter-residue couplings ranging over long distances in
presenting the RBD to the ACE2 receptor.
When the virus mutates these particular residues in a way that increases its virulence, this
increase stems from the propensity of the RBD to ”flap” open and thereby increase ACE2
binding. As evidence, we highlight the example of the D614G mutation, which is already
observed in numerous strains of the SARS-CoV-2 all over the world. 9,30 D614 is one of the
top ranked residues in our model for the potential to play a crucial role in RBD opening. A
glycine residue has the least backbone-torsion barrier for conformational transition in φ-ψ
space due to the absence of a side chain. Replacing an Asp residue, which has higher barriers
to such transitions, with a glycine can increase the flexibility of the backbone, significantly
impacting the probability of observing an RBD-up conformation. We speculate that this
can be the reason why this particular mutation was selected to become so widespread among
COVID-19 infected patients.

A wide range of spike protein mutant sequences have been characterized, each with
varying degrees of abundance. A relatively rare mutation, Ala-570-Val, resulted in a decrease
of the overall stability of the spike protein in all three states, based on the FoldX empirical
force field. 9,40 Free energy values 9 were obtained from only structural data and no dynamical
information was considered. Yet it is worth noting that the change in total and solvation free
energies, due to this mutation, were substantially different for the closed and open states,
resulting in a change in ∆G for RBD opening. But, as the side chains of Ala and Val are
similar in terms of steric bulk, this mutation is unlikely to significant impact RBD dynamics.
As it likely did not increase the evolutionary advantage of the virus by increasing infectivity,
this mutation, only occurring in one strain 9 so far, did not become as prevalent as D614G.
On the contrary, a A570D mutation is observed in the same residue in the newly emerged
and highly infectious B.1.1.7 strain in the UK. 31,41,42 This mutation is likely to play a pertinent role in infection as it replaces a hydrophobic amino acid with a charged one. This leads
to a significant difference in the conformational dynamics of the 570 residue and consequently
impacts the large scale RBD opening motion. The B.1.1.7 also shows a P681H mutation
close to the highly correlated N679 residue predicted from our model (see SI Appendix).
As this mutation replaces a structurally rigid proline residue, it can possible impact the
conformational space accessible to nearby residues, including N679.
Giving pause for thought, these results indicate that mutations in the highest correlated
residues (Table 1) can in fact have significant physiological impact in changing the course
of the pandemic. Therefore, we provide a list of residues (Table 1 and Fig. S3-S10 in SI
Appendix), future mutations of which could impact RBD dynamics and consequently change
the transmissibility or virulence of SARS-CoV-2. (See data availability statement for access
to the raw correlation coefficient data for all residues.)

Mutual information and network model
A different approach to characterize the coupling between distant regions in a protein is to
calculate the cross correlations between the positions of different residues in 3D space. This
method is often used to study allosteric effects upon ligand binding. 43–48 Conventional implementations compute the dynamic cross correlation map (DCCM) of the position vectors of
the Cα atoms. 49 However, DCCM ignores correlated motions in orthogonal directions. 48 This
problem can be avoided by using a linear mutual information (LMI) based cross-correlation
metric, which we use in the current study. 43,50 The cross-correlation matrix elements, Cij ,
are given by
Cij = (1 − e−(2/d)Iij )−1/2 ,

(1)

where Iij is the linear mutual information computed as

Iij = H(xi ) + H(xj ) − H(xi , xj )

where xi , xj are the Cartesian vectors of atomic coordinates, whereas p(xi ) and p(xi , xj )
indicate the probability density for xi and, respectively, the joint probability density of xi
and xj . 43,50
Strong correlations between distant residues are observed for the trajectories in all the
three states (Fig. 3). The change in cross-correlation between apo and holo states of a protein
is a gauge that traces allosteric communication in proteins. 43 While the RBD opening (or
closing) is not strictly an allosteric process (as there is no ligand binding involved), the
change in the cross-correlation between RBD down and up states (similar to holo and apo
structures) provides information about long-distance residue communication, which often
facilitates conformational change. That overall change in LMI correlation is clearly larger
for the fully open state in comparison to the partially open state (Fig. 3). Unsurprisingly, the
change is largest for the RBD and proximal residues encompassing the N-terminal domain
region (residue 100-300) in all chains, as they loose contact during the opening motion.
Residues in the range 524-600 show a correlation gain in the partially open state, unlike in
the fully open state. This result is consistent with the dihedral angle correlation, described in
the previous section: the residues in the loop region next to the RBD exhibit a change in the
values of the backbone dihedral angles upon the down to up transition. The change in the
correlation coefficient (∆Correlation) is also large for the RBDs and NTDs of chain B and C,
which are in close proximity to chain A of the RBD in the closed state. Additionally, residues
600-1000 of chain C show significant gain in correlation upon the opening transition. The
majority of these residues are situated at the opposite end (S2 region) of the spike, indicating
the presence of long range correlated motion.

For a more profound insight, we built a protein connectivity graph network-model . In
it, the Cα atoms of each amino acid are the nodes and the correlation between them are the
edges connecting the nodes (the number of nodes in our system, N=3438, is to our knowledge
higher than almost all other systems studied previously with this method 43–48 ). We then
calculated the betweenness centrality (BC), a graph theoretical measure that provides a way
to quantify the amount of information that flows via the nodes and edges of a network. If a
node i is working as a bridge between two other nodes along the shortest path joining them,
then the BC of node i is given by

BC(i) =

X ni

st

st

gst

,

(4)

where gst is the total number of geodesics (shortest paths) joining nodes s and t, out of
which nist paths pass through node i. 44 The change of BC in the dynamics of the spike
protein has been recently observed using coarse-grained simulation methods. 18 Despite the
coarseness of the model, a handful of residues participating in the information-propagating
pathway could be identified directly from the centrality values. In the current work, we
used the difference in BC as a metric to identify key residues which gain or loose relative
importance along the allosteric information pathway. The difference in the normalized BC
is measured by comparing the number for the partially open and fully open states with the
closed conformation (i.e. BC partially open −BC closed and BC fully open −BC closed for every residue
in the spike protein) from our all atom trajectories with explicit solvation. Importantly, our
model includes the highly relevant glycan shield, particularly the N-glycans at the NTD sites
N165 and N234, which were shown to modulate the conformational dynamics of the RBD

Figure 3: Upper panel: Cross correlation matrices for all three states computed using linear
mutual information. RBD regions form highly correlated blocks indicating that these residues
are largely decoupled from the rest of the protein. Still signatures of long-distance correlated
motion is detectable. Lower panel: Difference in correlation matrix elements for the partially
and fully open states with respect to the closed state. Residue index are assigned in the
following way: Chain A: 1-1146; Chain B: 1147-2292; Chain C: 2293-3438.

For both the open and partially open states, the residues with significant (i.e., >0.1)
change in BC are mostly from the NTD region or RBD region of the B and C chain. This
suggests that the allosteric information flows through the nearby NTD’s and RBDs, and
mutations in this region can break the allosteric network 44 and affect the functionality of
the spike protein. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were indeed observed to bind these
regions of the spike. 20 The identified residues are in close proximity to the RBD of chain A,
the one undergoing the down to up transition.
So the connectivity captured in the BC data is primarily due to short-range coupled
fluctuations. Such couplings are broken when the RBD and NTD move apart, leading to

the change in BC. For the same reason, the BC of the RBD of chain A increases in the fully
open state as its internal vibrations become more independent of the rest of the protein.
In a culmination of the above, the most interesting aspect is the strikingly large change
in BC of the residues which are distant from the RBD in 3D structure. Significant gain or
loss of BC is observed in residues 575, 607, 624, 757 , 896, and 897. The first three residues
are present in the linker region joining the RBD with the S2 domain, while the other three
are in the S2 itself. The linker region has a strong impact on the dynamics of the RBD
as we already established from the dihedral angle analysis. The allosteric network analysis
reinforces this conclusion. Moreover, the large change of BC in the S2 domain indicates
a complex long-range information flow connecting the RBD with the core residues of the
protein. This has substantial implications for pharmaceutical design, as mutations within
the S2 domain can impact the receptor-binding propensity of the viral spike. These results
also suggest that therapeutics targeted towards the S2 and towards the RBD-S2 linker can
be effective in preventing COVID-19 infection, without complications stemming from the
high rate of mutations in the RBD.

Sequence alignment and analysis
To understand the mutability of the most important dynamically-coupled regions, we performed sequence alignment of the 67 sequences of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein from the
Protein Data Bank. Analysis of the alignment using the ConSurf server 51 indicates that most
residues of the spike protein are highly conserved. In agreement with previous studies, 18,52
the variable residues are primarily concentrated in the receptor binding domain (Fig. 5).
Most glycosylations 53 are found in the conserved regions of the protein, except for N1134. All

of the strongly correlated residues predicted from our dihedral angle analysis are highly conserved (Gln613, Pro600, Gly601, Asn137, Ser112, Cys136, Phe833, Ile834, Ile569, His1083,
Asp1084), except for Asp614. Most of the non-RBD residues involved in the allosteric pathway of RBD opening are also highly conserved. The high level of conservation reinforces
their important role in the functioning of the spike. Possible mutations in these residues can
potentially result in new strains of higher infectivity or virulence in the near future.

Concluding Discussion
To tame this raging pandemic, we need to able to control the fundamental dynamics of the
spike protein. Its motion is key to the infection machinery of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. By
understanding the role of residues in its structure, we can anticipate new mutations and
customize treatments ahead of time. To curb the negative impact of mutations, we here

focused on the allosteric effect of protein residues that are away from its rapidly-mutating
epitope (the RBD) on the conformational change needed for infection.
We performed molecular dynamics simulations, with unsupervised machine learning (tICA)
and graph theory-based analysis to identify the role of physically distant residues in the dynamics of the receptor binding domain in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We correlated
the protein backbone torsion angles with the slowest degrees of freedom encompassing the
structural transition of the receptor binding domain. With this approach we were able to
elucidate a small number of distant non-RBD residues which strongly influence the conformational change of the spike, change that in turn leads to binding to the ACE2 receptor
and then to infection. Residues in the linker between the RBD and the S2 stem work as
a hinge by driving the down-to-up RBD transition via backbone torsional changes. Out of
the most correlated residues, D614 ranks close to the top. The D614G mutation is currently
observed in SARS-CoV-2, and is becoming widespread among infected patients throughout
the world. Our model predicted the D614 residue as a key player in RBD dynamics from
physics-based atomistic simulations without any prior knowledge of the mutation profile of
the spike. With glycine being more flexible in its backbone torsion compared to aspartate,
this mutation, according to our hypothesis, will facilitate the attainment of the partially open
state transiting from the closed structure. Another mutation, A570V, was observed within
our predicted residues, but did not yet become as widespread as D614G, likely because it
did not have substantial evolutionary advantage. However, a different mutation at residue
570 (A570D), has indeed appeared in the recently-emerged more-contagious B.1.1.7 strain of
SARS-CoV-2. 31 The consistency with the mutation profile confirms that our dihedral-angle
based analysis can not only find out distant residues impacting RBD dynamics, but can also
predict future mutations that can increase infection capability.
A cross-correlation metric based on linear mutual information (LMI) was also employed
to understand the long-distance coupled motion between RBD and non-RBD residues. The
change in LMI correlation primarily takes place in the residues adjacent to the RBD, but

20

we could also distinctly observe long-distance effects. Betweenness centrality (BC) of each
residue of the spike was computed from a Cα -based graph network model for all three conformational states. The residues showing largest changes in the BC are concentrated in NTD,
RBD and also in the linker regions joining the RBD with the rest of the protein and also in
the S2 domain. This reinforces the conclusion that RBD dynamics is in fact dominated by
long-distance allosteric effects in the spike protein, emmerging as a result of the collective
internal fluctuations of the amino-acid residues.
From the point of view of immediate therapeutic interventions, this study opens up
the possibility of designing inhibitors that bind to the regions outside the RBD, thereby
preventing infection by freezing RBD dynamics via steric restrictions on specific distant
residues. Such treatments are less likely to be affected by the evolutionary adaptations in
RBD sequence that the virus performs frequently to evade the immune response. In a broader
context, we pinpoint to future mutations in these key residues that can change the infection
rate and virulence, giving rise to new strains and significantly altering the course of the
pandemic. Our study and future work in this direction can make the scientific community
better prepared for such scenarios and can help in efficient prevention of future outbreaks.

Methods
The details of molecular dynamics simulations, tICA analysis, and mutual information based
network analysis are provided in the SI Appendix . A brief outline is included below.

System preparation and simulation details
Glycosylated and solvated structures of closed (PDB ID: 6VXX 24 ) and partially open (PDB
ID: 6VSB 26 ) spike head trimers were obtained from the CHARMM-GUI COVID-19 archive. 54
All simulations were performed using the CHARMM36m force field. 55 For the purpose of
the current work we considered residues 324-518 as the RBD. After minimization and short

equilibration, steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation were performed to induce the
opening of the closed state and closing of the partially open state of the RBD. Reaction coordinates (RC) were chosen to represent the distance of the RBD from its closed state position.
Multiple structures were chosen from the two SMD trajectory and two independent umbrella
sampling (US) simulations were performed for PDB ID: 6VXX and 6VSB. The reaction coordinate was restrained by a harmonic potential with force constant of 1 kcal/mol/Å2 for
35 windows and 26 windows for the two sets respectively. The colvars module 56 was used
for SMD and US calculations. Free energy profiles were computed using weighted histogram
analysis method (WHAM). 57

Unbiased simulations
Umbrella sampling trajectory frames were sampled from the regions near the open, closed and
the partially open intermediate state judging the free energy value. Unbiased simulations
were performed starting from these frames, resulting in 38 trajectories, each 40 ns long.
Three of these trajectories were identified as stable conformations corresponding to the
closed, partially open and fully open structure. These three trajectories were extended to 80
ns. A cumulative ∼1.6 µs unbiased simulation data were generated and used in subsequent
analysis.

Time-independent component analysis and mutual information
Time-independent component analysis (tICA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were
performed using pyEMMA package 58 on the entire unbiased trajectory data. The feature
space for PCA and tICA consisted of pairwise distances between specific residues in and
around RBD of chain A and nearby static regions.
The linear mutual information (LMI) based correlation was computed for the three 80 ns
trajectories. A graph theory based network model was constructed with the Cα atom of each
residue as node. The edge length between nodes were computed from the cross correlation

values using previously described procedure. 43 Betweenness centrality of each residue was
computed for each of the three trajectories and compared. All the LMI and network analysis
were performed using bio3D package. 59

Sequence alignment
Iterative sequence alignment of the 67 strains of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences from
the RCSB PDB database was performed using the MAFFT-DASH program 60 using the GINS-i algorithm. The sequence of PDB ID: 6VXX was used as the template. The alignment
was analyzed with the ConSurf server 51 to derive conservation scores for each residue position
in the alignment.
