Abstract
In this work, we evaluated the levels of genetic diversity in 38 complete Genomes of
SARS-CoV-2 from six countries in South America, using specific methodologies for
paired FST, AMOVA, mismatch, demographic and spatial expansions, molecular diversity
and for the time of evolutionary divergence. The analyses showed non-significant
evolutionary divergences within and between the six countries, as well as a significant
similarity to the time of genetic evolutionary divergence between all populations. Thus,
it seems safe to affirm that we will find similar results for the other Countries of South
America, reducing speculation about the existence of rapid and silent mutations that,
although there are as we have shown in this work, do not increase, until this moment, the
genetic variability of the Virus, a fact that would hinder the work with molecular targets
for vaccines and drugs in general.

1. Introduction
The new coronavirus, which originated in China, is now expanding into regions
marked by poverty, lack of access to water and therefore sanitation and hygiene measures.
It takes a geometric scale caused by the complete neglect of the rulers, a very common
thing in almost all countries of South America. All these associated factors interfere very
much in the epidemiological mechanics of the virus, accentuating the implications of the
pandemic. (MILLER et al, 2020). Despite this fact, some countries in South America put
in place laboratory and patient management protocols used in the SARS outbreak in 2003
and pandemic influenza in 2009, also seeking to establish communication strategies for
dissemination of prophylactic measures among neighboring countries, trying to align with
what is recommended and recommended by the WHO (RODRIGUEZ-MORALES et al.,
2020).
From these learned examples, we see the efficient and recent action of the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in the measles outbreak in Latin America,
issuing constant epidemiological alerts from January 2019 to January 2020, managing to
report 20,430 cases and 19 deaths in 14 countries: Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curacao, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. However,
despite efforts to employ protocols so far efficient in other viruses, in addition to this, the
lack of effective drugs against the new coronavirus and vaccines still in the testing phase
worldwide, trying to understand the evolutionary aspects of the virus, emerges as another
strategy that can help the scientific community discover significant biological aspects of
the virus, generating information that can be used, including, in the construction of drugs
and vaccines in progress and even in the most varied prophylaxis measures (PAHO,
2020).
Thinking so, the team of the Laboratory of Population Genetics and
Computational Evolutionary Biology (LaBECom-UNIVISA) conducted a study of
phylogeny and molecular variance analysis to evaluate the possible levels of genetic
diversity and polymorphisms existing in a PopSet of the complete genome of SARS-CoV2 from all over South America, available at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI), in the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 data hub
(GENBANK , 2020).

2. Objective
Evaluate the possible levels of genetic diversity and polymorphism existing in 38
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in South America.

3. Methodology
3.1. Databank: The 38 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from South
America (Brazil, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela with 16, 11, 1, 2, 1, 7
haplotypes, respectively) all with 29,906 pb extension and Phred values ≥ 40 and which

neage_ss=SARS-CoV2,%20taxid:2697049&Completeness_s=complete&Region_s=South%20America)

on

August 21, 2020).
3.2. Phylogenetic analyses: Nucleotide sequences previously described were used for
phylogenetic analyses. The sequences were aligned using the MEGA X program
(TAMURA et al., 2018) and the gaps were extracted for the construction of phylogenetic
trees.
3.3. Genetic Structuring Analyses: Paired FST estimators, Molecular Variance
(AMOVA), Genetic Distance, mismatch, demographic and spatial expansion analyses,
molecular diversity and evolutionary divergence time were obtained with the Software
Arlequin v. 3.5 (EXCOFFIER et al., 2005) using 1000 random permutations (NEI and
KUMAR, 2000). The FST and geographic distance matrices were not compared.

4. Results
4.1. General properties of complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from South
America
Of the 38 sequences of the complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 in South America
with 29,996 bp extension, the analyses revealed the presence of 75 polymorphic sites and
of these, only 71 sites were parsimonious-informative. The graphic representation of
these sites could be seen in a logo built with the software WEBLOGO 3. (CROOKS et

al., 2004), where the size of each nucleotide is proportional to its frequency for certain
sites. (Figure 1).

of SARS-CoV-2 from South America.

Using the UPGMA method, based on the 71 parsimony-informative sites, it was
also possible to understand that the 38 haplotypes comprised very similar groups
genetically and with a non-significant polymorphism pattern (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Evolutionary analysis by the maximum likelihood method. The evolutionary history was
inferred using the maximum likelihood method and the 3-parameter Tamura model [1]. The tree
with the highest probability of logging (-1366.35) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the
associated dollar sums group together is shown next to the branches. The initial trees for heuristic
research were obtained automatically by applying the Join-Join and BioNJ algorithms to an array
of distances in estimated pairs using the Tamura 3 parameter model and then selecting the topology
with a higher log probability value. This analysis involved 38 nucleotide sequences. The
evolutionary analyses were performed in MEGA X

4.2. Molecular Variance Analysis (AMOVA) and Genetic Distance
Genetic distance and molecular variation (AMOVA) analyses were not significant
for the groups studied, presenting a variation component of 0.12 between populations and
4.46 within populations. The FST value (0.03) showed a low fixation index, with nonsignificant evolutionary divergences within and between groups (Table 1 and Figure 3).
A significant similarity was also evidenced for the time of genetic evolutionary
divergence among all populations; supported by τ variations, mismatch analyses and
demographic and spatial expansion analyses. With a representative exception for
haplotypes from Brazil and Venezuela (Table 2), (Figures 4 and 5).

The molecular diversity analyses estimated per θ reflected a significant level of
mutations among all haplotypes (transitions and transversions). Indel mutations
(insertions or additions) were not found in any of the six groups studied. The D tests of
Tajima and Fs de Fu showed disagreements between the estimates of general θ and π, but
with negative and highly significant values, indicating, once again, an absence of
population expansions. The irregularity index (R= Raggedness) with parametric
bootstrap, simulated new θ values for before and after a supposed demographic expansion
and in this case assumed a value equal to zero for all groups (Table 6); (Figure 6).

5. Discussion
As the use of phylogenetic analysis and population structure methodologies had
not yet been used in this PopSet, in this study it was possible to detect the existence of 6
distinct groups for the complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from South America,
but with minimal variations among all of them. The groups described here presented

minimum structuring patterns and were effectively slightly higher for the populations of
Brazil and Venezuela. These data suggest that the relative degree of structuring present
in these two countries may be related to gene flow. These structuring levels were also
supported by simple phylogenetic pairing methodologies such as UPGMA, which in this
case, with a discontinuous pattern of genetic divergence between the groups (supports the
idea of possible sub-geographical isolations resulting from past fragmentation events),
was observed a not so numerous amount of branches in the tree generated and with few
mutational steps.
These few mutations have possibly not yet been fixed by drift by the lack of the
founding effect, which accompanies the behavior of dispersion and/or loss of intermediate
haplotypes throughout the generations. The values found for genetic distance support the
presence of this continuous pattern of low divergence between the groups studied, since
they considered important the minimum differences between the groups, when the
haplotypes between them were exchanged, as well as the inference of values greater than
or equal to that observed in the proportion of these permutations, including the p-value of
the test.
The discrimination of the 38 genetic entities in their localities was also perceived
by their small inter-haplotypic variations, hierarchised in all covariance components: by
their intra- and inter-individual differences or by their intra- and intergroup differences,
generating a dendogram that supports the idea that the significant differences found in
countries such as Brazil and Venezuela, for example, were shared more in their form than
in their number , since the result of estimates of the average evolutionary divergence
found within these and other countries, even if they exist, were very low.
Based on the high level of haplotypic sharing, tests that measure the relationship
between genetic distance and geographic distance, such as the Mantel test, were dispensed
in this Estimators θ, even though they are extremely sensitive to any form of molecular
variation (FU, 1997), supported the uniformity between the results found by all the
methodologies employed, and can be interpreted as a phylogenetic confirmation that there
is a consensus in the conservation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the Countries of
America of America of South objects of this study, being therefore safe to affirm that the
small number of existing polymorphisms should be reflected even in all their protein
products. This consideration provides the safety that, although there are differences in the
haplotypes studied, these differences are minimal in geographically distinct regions and

thus it seems safe to extrapolate the levels of polymorphism and molecular diversity found
in the samples of this study to other genomes of other South American countries, reducing
speculation about the existence of rapid and silent mutations that , although they exist as
we have shown in this work, they can significantly increase the genetic variability of the
Virus, making it difficult to work with molecular targets for vaccines and drugs in general.
