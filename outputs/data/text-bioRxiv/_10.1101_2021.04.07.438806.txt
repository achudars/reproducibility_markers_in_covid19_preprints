Summary
The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread around the world with unprecedented health
and socio-economic effects for the global population. While different vaccines are now being
made available, very few antiviral drugs have been approved. The main viral protease
(nsp5) of SARS-CoV-2 provides an excellent target for antivirals, due to its essential and
conserved function in the viral replication cycle. We have expressed, purified and developed
assays for nsp5 protease activity. We screened the nsp5 protease against a custom
chemical library of over 5,000 characterised pharmaceuticals. We identified calpain inhibitor
I and three different peptidyl fluoromethylketones (FMK) as inhibitors of nsp5 activity in vitro,
with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. By altering the sequence of our peptidomimetic
FMK inhibitors to better mimic the substrate sequence of nsp5, we generated an inhibitor
with a subnanomolar IC50. Calpain inhibitor I inhibited viral infection in monkey-derived Vero
E6 cells, with an EC50 in the low micromolar range. The most potent and commercially
available peptidyl-FMK compound inhibited viral growth in Vero E6 cells to some extent,
while our custom peptidyl FMK inhibitor offered a marked antiviral improvement.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged late in 2019 and
rapidly spread around the world, developing into the worst health crisis of the 21st century [1,
2]. As of February 2021, a year after the WHO declared the outbreak a public health
emergency of international concern, over 100 million cases have been confirmed, with more
than 2.4 million deaths attributed to COVID-19 [3]. Over 60 different vaccines have now
reached the clinical development stage, with several approved worldwide [4]. Vaccinating
vulnerable people against SARS-CoV-2 is of paramount importance. However, new variants
of the virus are emerging, and it is unclear how long vaccines will remain effective [5, 6].

Thus, to combat this pandemic most effectively, antiviral drugs are needed as complements
to vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 encodes at least nine enzymes that are important for viral proliferation and
thus are attractive targets for antiviral drugs. In contrast to the rapidly evolving structural
proteins of the virus that the vaccines are based on, these enzymes are highly conserved
between different coronaviruses [7, 8]. This suggests that antivirals inhibiting these enzymes
may be useful as pan-coronavirus treatments and as the virus becomes resistant to existing
vaccines. COVID-19 is already the third zoonotic coronavirus after SARS-CoV-1 and MERSCoV that emerged as global health threats during the last two decades [9], so the availability
of pan-coronavirus treatments as a first line of defence against novel coronaviruses may be
crucial in the future.
The first two-thirds of the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes sixteen non-structural proteins
(nsps), which are required for viral proliferation [10, 11]. They are encoded in two large
overlapping open reading frames (ORF 1a and ORF 1ab). Upon entry into the host cell,
these are translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab respectively), which are cleaved
by two virus encoded cysteine proteases, generating sixteen functional nsps. The viral
papain like protease (PLpro), which is encoded within nsp3, excises nsp1-3 [12]. The main
viral protease (nsp5) is a chymotrypsin-related protease that cleaves the polyproteins at
eleven sites, releasing nsp4-nsp16 [13-15]. The excised nsps are essential for the assembly
of the viral replication transcription complex [11]. Inhibition of nsp5, therefore, blocks the viral
replication cycle, making it an attractive antiviral drug target [16]. Nsp5 structure and function
is conserved across all coronaviruses, with SARS-CoV-1 and 2 sharing roughly 96%
sequence identity with the greatest degree of sequence conservation around the active site
[14]. Nsp5 cleaves polyproteins after a glutamine residue, which is the case for the vast
majority of coronavirus main proteases but is rare in human proteases [8, 17, 18]. This
suggests that antivirals targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease may have broad spectrum
anti-coronavirus inhibitory effects. As part of a larger project to identify inhibitors of all SARS-

CoV-2 enzymes, here we describe a high-throughput drug screen to identify inhibitors of the
main viral protease nsp5.

Results
Expression and purification of nsp5
It has previously been shown that both C- and N-terminal epitope tags inhibit nsp5
dimerization and activity [17, 19]. Therefore, we optimised a purification method for a full
length, untagged nsp5 from E. coli based on the SUMO/Ulp1 cleavable tag system (Figure
1A)[20]. Figure 1B shows fractions from the purification steps separated in an SDSpolyacrylamide gel; nsp5 migrates at around 36 kDa. This method resulted in a high yield of
relatively pure nsp5.
To examine nsp5 protease activity, we designed a nsp9 gel-based cleavage assay. For this
we synthesised a fusion protein substrate with a short linker sequence based on the nsp4nsp5 junction (SAVLQ) in-between a FLAG-His epitope tag and the nsp9 protein (Figure
1C). We selected the nsp4-5 cleavage site, as it is a natural cleavage site of nsp5 predicted
to have the highest affinity [17]. Cleavage of the substrate, which migrates at approximately
20 kDa, by nsp5 results in the release of untagged nsp9, which migrates at approximately 12
kDa. Cleavage of the Flag-His-SAVLQ-nsp9 substrate over time by nsp5 can be observed
from as early as 30 minutes at both 0.5 µM and 1 µM of nsp5 (Figure 1D).
FRET-based primary screen optimisation
To carry out enzymatic characterisation and high throughput screening (HTS) for nsp5
inhibitors, we optimised a Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based
assay (Figure 2A). We used a 10 amino acid-long peptide substrate based on the natural
nsp4-nsp5 cleavage site. The peptide is covalently attached to the fluorophore 2aminobenzoyl (Abz) at its N-terminus and a quencher (N-Tyrosine) at its C-terminus (Figure
2A). Cleavage of the substrate releases the fluorophore from the proximity of the quencher,
resulting in an increase of fluorescent signal. Using this substrate, we determined the KM of

nsp5 for this substrate to be 33.7 ± 4.7 µM (Figure 2B). This is comparable to a previously
reported value of 28.2 μM using a similar FRET substrate [21].
We found that, at an enzyme concentration of 10 nM, the reaction is roughly linear for the
first 20 minutes at room temperature (19 – 23 °C) (Figure 2C-D). We used a substrate
concentration of 20 µM for the HTS, which is relatively close to the KM value to ensure that
competitive as well as non-competitive inhibitors can be identified [22]. We also found that
buffer conditions had a profound effect on activity, especially when using automated liquid
handling (Figure S1). In brief, it proved essential to include glycerol (between 5-10%) and
detergent (e.g. 0.01-0.02% Tween 20) to stabilise the enzyme. Inclusion of detergent also
prevents compound aggregation ([23] and Zeng et al. this issue).
High throughput screen hit identification and validation
We carried out a high throughput screen (HTS) of a custom library with over 5,000
compounds at two drug concentrations of 4 µM and 0.8 µM. For the HTS, we incubated the
compounds with nsp5 before reaction initiation to allow for the detection of slow-binding
inhibitors. We defined primary hits as compounds that reduced nsp5 activity by more than
30% at the higher compound concentration (Figure 3A, see Methods). We identified 27
primary hits that met this criterion and ranked them by percentage inhibition of nsp5 activity
at both drug concentrations (Table 1) and validated them according to the scheme
presented in Figure 3B.
Some compounds within the library interfered with the HTS emission wavelength (420 nm),
increasing the fluorescence of the first time point and subsequent time points. Due to a
maximum range of fluorescence detection these reactions became saturated over the
course of the reaction resulting in an artificially reduced rate of reaction being determined for
these compounds. We classed drug compounds that did not interfere with the HTS emission
wavelength as “normal”. Those that interfered slightly but a reduction in nsp5 activity was
still evident we classed as “moderate”. Finally, those that greatly interfered with the HTS
fluorescence and so were likely artificial hits we classed as “high” (Table 1). We excluded

fourteen drugs from the primary hit list, which showed “high” autofluorescence. We were
unable to source one of the compounds, so we tested twelve compounds further as nsp5
inhibitors.
We first re-tested these twelve compounds in the FRET-based assay over a range of drug
concentrations from 0 to 500 µM and calculated IC50 values where possible. Four
compounds did not show reproducible inhibition of nsp5 across any of the tested drug
concentrations (Figure S2A) and we, therefore, discarded them. Tryphostin artificially
increased fluorescence in the FRET- based assay at some concentrations tested, reducing
the number of points available for IC50 calculation. Therefore, we also tested it in the nsp9
gel-based cleavage assay (Figure S2A). As it did not inhibit in either validation step, we
discarded it. Fatostatin HBr and PDK1 /Akt /Flt Dual pathway showed some inhibition of
nsp5 in the FRET-based assay. However, they had relatively high IC50 values for nsp5
inhibition and they did not show inhibition at any of the drug concentrations in the nsp9 gelbased assay, thus, we removed them from the final hit list (Figure S2B).
The remaining five drugs inhibited nsp5 in both the FRET-based and gel-based assays:
Calpain Inhibitor I (IC50: 5.17 ± 0.17 µM), bromoenol lactone (IC50: 3.4. ± 0.09 µM), Z-DEVDFMK (IC50: 0.23 ± 0.03 µM), Z-IETD-FMK (IC50: 0.23 ± 0.01 µM) and Z-VAD-FMK (IC50: 0.16
± 0.01 µM) (Figure 3C, Figure S2C-D). Calpain Inhibitor I and Z-DEVD-FMK were described
recently as nsp5 inhibitors in vitro [21, 24]. To test the specificity of the final five drugs we
tested them against a different protease, thrombin. We used the same buffer as in the HTS,
which contained a non-ionic detergent, which reduces the likelihood of unspecific inhibition
via colloidal aggregation [23]. We used a substrate based on the natural thrombin substrate:
Aminobenzoyl- LGARGHRPYD-N-Tyrosine [25]. Of the five drugs, only bromoenol lactone
inhibited thrombin activity (Figure 3D) indicating that it is not a specific inhibitor of nsp5.
Lastly, we tested whether these compounds could inhibit the other viral coronavirus protease
(nsp3 PLpro), which is also a cysteine protease [26]. The substrate and assay conditions
used in this experiment are described elsewhere (see Lim et al, Biochemical J, this issue).

None of the remaining hits from the primary screen inhibited PLpro, indicating a specificity
for nsp5 (Figure 3E). All together, we have identified four specific inhibitors of nsp5 in vitro
(Table 2).
Evaluation of Ebselen as a nsp5 inhibitor
Ebselen has recently been described as an nsp5 inhibitor [14], but was not identified as an
hit in our screen. We wondered whether this discrepancy was due to the presence of
reducing agent in our reaction buffers, which was not present in the previous work [14]. We
tested Ebselen against nsp5 in the FRET-based assay over a wide range of concentrations
in the presence of either DTT or a more physiologically relevant reducing agent, LGlutathione (GSH) (Figure 4A) [27, 28]. Ebselen inhibited nsp5 only in the absence of a
reducing agent with an IC50 in the micromolar range. In the presence of either reducing
agent there was only a slight reduction of nsp5 activity, at concentrations higher than
100 µM. (Figure 4A). In contrast, Calpain Inhibitor I inhibited nsp5 in the absence of reducing
agent as well as the presence of either reducing agent (Figure 4B). The presence of
reducing agents did not affect the activity of nsp5 in the absence of inhibitor (Figure S3A).
Taken together, these results indicate that Ebselen can only inhibit nsp5 under non-reducing
conditions. A similar conclusion was also reached recently by Ma et al. [29].
Antiviral activity of drugs in cell-based assay
We next tested the ability of our best hit compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in
monkey-derived Vero E6 cells as described by Zeng et al (see this issue) (Figure 5A).
Calpain inhibitor I, which has previously been tested for nsp5 inhibition in vitro but not in a
cell-based assay [21], was the most potent inhibitor of viral infection with an EC50 value of
0.28 ± 0.01 µM. Despite being a good inhibitor in vitro, the Z-VAD-FMK inhibitor displayed
inhibition only at concentrations greater than 100 µM (Figure 5B-C).
Combining two antiviral drugs with two different modes of action is a common strategy in
treating viral infections as it can increase each drug’s effectiveness and prevent the

emergence of drug resistance [30]. We therefore tested the inhibitory capacity of our best
hits in the same cell-based assay in combination with remdesivir. Remdesivir is a broad
spectrum nucleoside analogue that is currently the only approved antiviral drug against
SARS-CoV-2 and targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [31]. None of the nsp5
inhibitors tested showed synergistic or additive effect with remdesivir (Figure S4A-B).
Improved nsp5 peptidomimetic inhibitors
The three most potent inhibitors in vitro were the FMK peptidomimetic inhibitors, originally
designed to target caspases [32]. These FMK peptidomimetic inhibitors comprise an Nterminal group that increases cell permeability, a short peptidyl targeting sequence, and a Cterminal functional group which can covalently bind to and inactivate the active cysteine
residue in proteases (Figure 6C). We initially tried to investigate the effect of different Cterminal functional groups on inhibitor potency. The functional group in all three of the
peptidomimetic inhibitors picked up in our screen is a fluoromethylketone group. While these
are non-toxic to cells in culture, experiments in mice showed that their metabolic conversion
leads to the production of toxic fluoroacetate [32, 33]. Some safer alternatives of the FMK
peptidomimetic inhibitors are available commercially. One such alternative has been
developed based on the difluorophenoxymethylketone (OPh) functional group [32]. While
they were not present in our drug library, three of them are available commercially; Q-VDOPh, Q-DEVD-OPh and Q-IETD-OPh. We tested these three drugs in the nsp9 gel-based
cleavage assay. Of these, Q-IETD-OPh showed the best nsp5 inhibition in the gel-based
assay, Q-DEVD-OPh only displayed inhibition at the highest concentration of drug tested
and Q-VD-OPh did not inhibit nsp5 activity (Figure 6A). Similarly, in the FRET-based assay,
Q-IETD-OPh was the most effective nsp5 inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 17.4 ± 1 µM (Figure
6B). This comparison between peptides with the same amino acid sequence, but differing
functional groups, shows that the FMK peptidomimetic inhibitors are more potent inhibitors
of nsp5 in vitro than the OPh variants.

Next, we tested whether changing the sequence of the peptidyl moiety would improve the
inhibitor potency of the FMK compounds. The three FMK inhibitors identified in the screen
mimic the substrate sequence of different caspases [32]. All of them have a common length
of three or four amino acids, two hydrophobic residues as well as one charged residue.
Work on SARS-CoV-1 nsp5 indicates that bulky hydrophobic residues are key for substrate
recognition, especially in the P2 position (Figure 6C) [34]. We hypothesised that altering the
amino acid targeting sequence to further mimic an nsp5 substrate might improve the
inhibitory effect on nsp5. We synthesised three custom FMK inhibitors, with lengths varying
from four to six amino acids (Figure 6C) [35-37]. Their peptidyl moiety mimicked the
sequence around the natural nsp4/5 cut site [17]. To simplify chemical synthesis by basing it
on previous approaches, we used an aspartic acid instead of a glutamine at the P1 site and
an alanine instead of a threonine in the P6 site.
All three custom peptidomimetic compounds exhibited sub-micromolar IC50 values in the
FRET-based assay (Figure 6D). Z-ASAVLD-FMK had the highest IC50 (0.26 ± 0.02 µM),
followed by Z-SAVLD-FMK (0.02 ± 0.001 µM). Z-AVLD-FMK, the shortest of the peptides,
exhibited by far the greatest inhibitory potency with an IC50 of less than 1 nM (IC50 = 0.8 ±
0.09 nM) which is a substantial improvement over the best commercially available
peptidomimetic compound Z-VAD-FMK (IC50: 0.16 ± 0.01 µM).
To assess whether the customisation also improved the in vivo inhibitory capacity, we tested
the best custom nsp5 inhibitor (Z-AVLD-FMK) in the viral infection assay (Figure 7A-B). We
determined the EC50 value for Z-AVLD-FMK to be 66.01 ± 7.28 µM. Compared to the
commercial Z-VAD-FMK, this is a 2-fold increase in inhibitor potency (Figure 7 and Figure
5). This showed that changing the peptidyl moiety to mimic the nsp5 substrate greatly
improved its in vitro and cell-based inhibitory effect. Taken together, our work indicates that
FMK inhibitors targeting nsp5 could be used as a starting point for the development of
effective antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
One effective strategy for combatting the COVID-19 pandemic is to re-purpose existing
drugs to rapidly identify potential antivirals. The main viral protease is a promising antiviral
drug target as it plays a critical role in viral replication by generating the functional viral
replication proteins from the polyproteins [13, 14]. Consequently, nsp5 inhibition can halt
viral replication and thus might reduce viral load in COVID-19 patients. In our screen of a
custom chemical library, we identified calpain inhibitor I and three fluoromethylketone (FMK)
peptidomimetics as drugs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 in vitro and in a
cell-based viral infection assay. In addition, we have further highlighted that the
customisation of peptidomimetic FMK inhibitors provide a good starting point for the
synthesis of nsp5 specific inhibitors.
Calpain inhibitor I is a synthetic tripeptide aldehyde that acts as a potent inhibitor of cysteine
proteases including calpain I, calpain II and cathepsins [38]. It has been tested in mice
without obvious toxic effects [39]. Ma et al also recently identified Calpain Inhibitor I and
several other calpain inhibitors as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5, with IC50 values
comparable to the results from our HTS in the low µM range [21] in biochemical assays. Our
results show that Calpain inhibitor I also inhibited viral growth in a cell-based assay. This
suggests that Calpain inhibitors may be useful antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2.
Three of the strongest hits identified in our HTS were cell permeable FMK peptides. Peptidyl
FMKs are widely used due to their ability to strongly and selectively inhibit serine and
cysteine proteases, such as caspases, cathepsins and Sentrin/SUMO specific proteases
[32, 36]. FMK peptides have been previously investigated as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-1
nsp5 in vitro, and one FMK peptide (Z-DEVD-FMK) has recently been identified as an
inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 nsp5 [24, 40]. The peptidyl backbone of these FMK inhibitors
allows them to be utilised for target-based inhibition of specific proteases by mimicking the
substrate sequence that binds directly to the active site of the protease. Since the substrate
sequence preference of nsp5 is known, we designed three custom inhibitors with the

peptidyl moiety based on the nsp5 cleavage site with the predicted highest affinity (nsp4/5)
[17]. The shortest of the custom inhibitors, Z-AVLD-FMK, showed extraordinary inhibitor
potency in vitro with a sub-nanomolar IC50. It also improved the inhibitor potency in the cellbased viral infection assay implying that inhibition is a result of the FMK peptides action on
nsp5. This shows that peptidomimetic inhibitors are an excellent tool for probing nsp5
protease activity in vitro and in cell culture due to their easily customisable nature.
Our custom inhibitors could be further optimised by incorporating a glutamine, found in all
natural nsp5 substrate sequences, at the P1 site [8, 18]. Another way forward may be to
exchange the FMK functional group with less toxic versions such as
difluorophenoxymethylketone (OPh). The development of FMK peptides into clinical drugs
was initially halted due to high in vivo host cell toxicity. This may be due to the metabolic
conversion of the m-FMK group into toxic fluoroacetate, especially in the liver [32].
However, promising studies in mice treated with a peptidyl-OPh inhibitor suggested this
alternative functional group it was well tolerated [41]. Furthermore, Q-VD-OPh, has been
used in trials investigating AIDS disease progression in rhesus macaques with no toxic side
effects [42]. While the commercially available OPh compounds we tested inhibited nsp5 to a
lesser extent than the FMK counterparts, customisation of their substrate sequence will likely
increase their inhibitory potency against nsp5. Thus, exchanging the functional group of the
customised FMK inhibitors could allow them to be developed into clinical drugs.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification
Nsp5
The nsp5 coding sequence was subcloned from a bacterial expression vector of MBP-nsp5,
constructed in MRC PPU (DU67716; available from https://mrcppu-covid.bio/). However, this
vector was mis-designed for the C-terminal of nsp5, whereby it only expressed 302 amino
acids so the remaining four were added via PCR (forward: 5' –
gaacagattggtggcAGCGGCTTTCGCAAAATGGCG, reverse 5' –
gtgcggccgcttattaCTGAAAGGTCACGCCGCTGCACTGGCGCACCAC). The amplified
fragment was then assembled by Gibson assembly in the K27Sumo bacterial expression
vector [43] to express 14His-SUMO (N-ter) tagged-nsp5 (306 aa). The final construct
(SARS-CoV-2 His-SUMO-nsp5) was then transformed into E. coli Rosetta competent cells
(Sigma-Aldrich Cat No.71400). Cultures were grown under selective conditions (Kanamycin
50 µg/mL + chloramphenicol 34 µg/mL) at 37 °C until OD 0.8 (600 nm) and expression
induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG overnight at 16 °C. Cells were then harvested at
5000 x g for 10 minutes and resuspended in lysis buffer; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole and 0.05% NP-40. Cell lysis was done
with the addition of 50 µg /mL lysozyme for 10 minutes on ice. Cells were then sonicated at
50% amplitude for 3 x 15s before clarification at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 minutes in JA30.50 rotor.
Ni-NTA beads (Thermo Cat. No R90115) were equilibrated in lysis buffer and incubated with
crude cell extract for 1 hour at 4 °C. Beads were then collected and washed with lysis buffer
before an ATP wash in lysis buffer (+2 mM ATP and 10 mM Mg(OAc)2). Samples were then
eluted in elution buffer; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl,
400 mM imidazole and 0.05% NP-40. Nsp5 positive fractions were pooled and incubated
with 2 µg/mL of Ulp1 protease overnight at 4 °C to cleave off the 14His-SUMO tag. After

cleavage, sample was diluted to 100 mM NaCl in buffer and purified further by anion
exchange chromatography over a HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare (Sigma) Cat. No GE290513-25). The flow through fraction was collected, concentrated to less than 500 µl in a 10K
cut off Ultrafiltration Unit (Sigma Cat. No. UFC801024) for a final step of gel filtration over a
Superdex 75 column (Sigma-Aldrich Cat. No. GE17-5174-01) into a final buffer; 25 mM
HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT.
Nsp9 (for gel-based protease assay)
3xFlag-His6-SAVLQ-nsp9 (3FH-nsp9) was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect
cells. The coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 (NCBI reference sequence NC_045512.2)
was codon-optimised for S. frugiperda and synthesised (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Nsp9 was subcloned into the biGBac vector pLIB [44] to include an N-terminal 3xFlag-His6
tag followed by the last five amino acids of nsp4 (sequence:
MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDKHHHHHSAVLQ-nsp9) (final construct name: SARSCoV-2 3xFlag-His-nsp5CS-nsp9). Baculoviruses were generated in Sf9 cells (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) using the EMBacY baculoviral genome [45]. For protein expression Sf9 cells were
infected with baculovirus. Cells were collected 48 h after infection, flash-frozen and stored at
-80 °C.
Cell pellets were resuspended in nsp9 buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 250 mM sodium
chloride, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM DTT)
supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Complete Ultra tablets, 1 mM AEBSF, 10
µg/ml pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml leupeptin) and lysed with a dounce homogenizer. The protein
was purified from the cleared lysate by affinity to Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich)
and eluted with nsp9 buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml 3xFlag peptide.
Gel based nsp9 cleavage assay
Reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA,
2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.02% Tween-20. A concentration of 1 µM nsp5 was used

unless otherwise specified. This was incubated with drug compounds resuspended in DMSO
or DMSO alone for 10 minutes at room temperature. Reactions were then initiated by the
addition of 6.25 µM FLAG-His-SAVLQ-nsp9 substrate. Protease activity was allowed to
continue for 1 hour at room temperature before reactions were quenched and denatured by
the addition of SDS loading buffer. Products were then separated over a 12% Bis-Tris gel in
MOPS buffer and stained with coomassie blue (Generon Cat. No NB-45-00078-1L).
FRET peptide substrate synthesis
The assay uses a FRET peptide substrate (2-aminobenzoyl – AVLQSGFRKK – tyrosine(3NO2)R-COOH) which was synthesised in house. The peptides were synthesised on an
Intavis ResPep SLi Peptide Synthesiser (CEM, Buckingham, UK) on pre-loaded LL Wang
resin using N(a)-Fmoc amino acids including Fmoc-Abz-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(3-NO2)-OH and
Fmoc-Gln(trt)-Ser(psi(Me,Me)pro)-OH using HATU as the coupling reagent. Following amino
acid chain assembly, peptides were cleaved from the resin by addition to cleavage cocktail
(10 mL, 95% TFA, 2.5% H2O, 2.5% TIS) for 2 hours. Following resin removal, peptide
precipitation and extensive washing with ether, the peptides were freeze dried. Aliquots of
the peptide were dissolved in water and purified on a C8 reverse phase HPLC column
(Agilent PrepHT Zorbax 300SB-C8, 21.2x250 mm, 7 m) using a linear solvent gradient of 1050% MeCN (0.08% TFA) in H2O (0.08% TFA) over 40 minutes at a flow rate of 8 mL/min.
The peptides were analysed by LC–MS on an Agilent 1100 LC-MSD. The FRET peptide
substrate (2-aminobenzoyl- LGARGHRPYD- tyrosine(3-NO2)R-COOH) used with the
thrombin FRET protease assay was synthesised by the same method.
FRET-based nsp5 activity assay
A FRET-based fluorescence quenching assay was developed to monitor hydrolysis activity
of nsp5. Upon cleavage of the substrate 2-Aminobenzoyl is no longer quenched by NTyrosine and able to fluorescence. Any changes in fluorescence were monitored in the
excitation spectra of 330 nm and emission spectra of 420 nm. Unless otherwise stated, the

reaction master mix used in all FRET experiments contributed to a final concentration of; 10
nM nsp5, 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.02%
Tween. Reactions were initiated by the addition of FRET substrate to a final concentration of
20 µM (unless otherwise stated) to reaction master mix. A Tecan M1000 pro or Tecan Spark
were used to take fluorescence readings for all FRET experiments with the following
settings: Kinetic cycle: 10, Interval time: 2 minutes, Excitation bandwidth: 5nm, Emission
bandwidth: 15 nm, Gain: 140, Number of flashes: 50, Flash frequency: 400 Hz, Integration
time: 20 µs and Z-position: 22470 µm. All nsp5 protease reactions were done at room
temperature (19°C - 23°C) however, ambient temperature inside the Tecan M1000 pro or
Tecan Spark plate readers fluctuated between 25°C and 27.5°C.
Km determination of nsp5 for FRET-based substrate
To determine the KM for our FRET substrate, the FRET-based nsp5 activity assay was done
as described but with a substrate concentration range of 0 – 75 µM. Initial velocities of the
proteolytic activity were calculated by linear regression of the first 14 minutes of the kinetic
progress curve and KM values were calculated by fitting to a Michaelis-Menten equation
using GraphPad PRISM (Version 8.4.3). These data were corrected for inner filter effect by
the method described by Liu et. al [46].
Nsp5 High throughput screen (HTS)
To identify inhibitors of nsp5 the FRET-based nsp5 activity assay, as described above, was
used to screen a custom library of over 5,000 compounds assembled from different sources
(Sigma, Selleck, Enzo, Tocris, Calbiochem, and Symansis). All drug compounds present in
the custom library were stored at a stock concentration of 10 mM in DMSO. Two
concentrations of the custom library were used in the HTS. In the high concentration (4 µM)
12.5 nL of compound was distributed into 24 384-well plates (Greiner 384 Flat Bottom Black
Polystyrene Cat. No.: 781076) using an Echo 550 (Labcyte) onto 1µL DMSO into columns 322. At the lower concentration (0.8 µM) 2.5 nL of drug compound was distributed onto 1 µL
DMSO in the same way. Each HTS plate had a total of 4 columns (1-2, 23-24) without drug

compounds which were used for control reactions. Columns 1 and 23 contained a positive
control of enzyme with no drug and then columns 2 and 24 served as negative controls of
reactions with no enzyme. After reaction master mix (22.5 µL, as described above) was
dispensed into 384-well reaction plates by XRD-384 Automated Reagent Dispensers (FluidX
Ltd). Plates were then centrifuged briefly at 1,000 x g and incubated at room temperature for
10 min. To start the reaction, 12.5 µl of 20 µM FRET substrate was dispensed and the plates
were spun briefly. Following reaction initiation, fluorescence readings were taken every 2
min for a total of 10 time points from 1 minute 20 seconds into the reaction.
Identification of Primary Hits
Time-course data was analysed using MATLAB (R2020_a) to determine the rate of reaction
then normalised to the rate of reaction of positive (no drug compound) control reaction wells.
We assessed each individual HTS screen plate and the HTS as a whole by calculating a Z’
factor score based on normalised rate of reaction compared to no enzyme controls. The
screen had a Z’ factor greater than 0.6 indicating that we could reliably identify hits.
Percentage reduction in rate of reaction or “activity” were then calculated for each drug
compound. Those with a reduction in activity that was greater than 30% in the highest drug
concentration (4 µM) were selected as primary hits. Hits were then ranked based on
percentage reduction in activity and whether they were hits in both HTS concentrations.
Compound resuspension for hit validation
Compounds selected for in vitro experimental validation and cell-based experiments were
purchased and resuspended into DMSO following manufacturer’s instruction.
Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) determination
Drug compounds for IC50 determination were titrated over a wide range from 1500 mM to
either 1 nM over 20 steps or from 500 mM to 10 pM over 30 steps depending on the drug
stock concentrations available. FRET-based nsp5 activity assays were carried out, as
described above. The rate of the reaction was determined from the time-course data and
normalised to positive control (no drug) samples. IC50 values were then calculated using

Figure Legends
Figure 1: Nsp5 expression, purification and activity test by nsp9 gel-based assay
A) Schematic overview of nsp5 purification. Crude cell extracts containing His14-SUMO
tagged nsp5 is bound to a Ni-NTA resin, washed with ATP and then eluted by His14-SUMO
cleavage by the protease Ulp1. Major contaminates are then removed over an anion
exchange and gel filtration column.
B) Coomassie gel of His14-SUMO cleavage. Panel 1: Elution from Ni-NTA beads before and
after cleavage of nsp5 by the Ulp1 SUMO-dependent protease. Panel 2: Sample of the flow
through from the anion exchange column. Panel 3: Input for gel filtration column. Panel 4:
Fractions taken across the major peak of the gel filtration elution. Lanes six through eight (in
bold) were pooled and concentrated for use in the HTS screen.
C) Schematic overview of nsp9 gel-based cleavage assay. The substrate of FLAG-HisSAVLQ-nsp9 is incubated nsp5. Cleavage of the substrate results in two products: nsp9 and
FLAG-His-SAVLQ.
D) Gel-based assay for nsp9 cleavage by nsp5 over time at 500 and 1000 nM of nsp5. Nsp5
is visible at around 35 kDa and the substrate of uncleaved nsp9 visible at around 12 kDa.
Figure 2: Enzyme assay design and characterisation
A) Schematic of the FRET-based protease assay. In the uncleaved state the fluorescence of
aminobenzoyl is quenched by N-tyrosine. Once the protease cleaves the peptide, the
fluorescent signal increases proportionally to protease activity.
B) Determination of enzyme kinetics. Initial reaction rates over a range of concentrations
were plotted against substrate concentration to obtain values for KM (33.72 ± 4.68 µM). Data
is plotted as the mean and standard deviation (SD) of 3 replicates.
C) Protease activity of nsp5. Increase in fluorescence 20 minutes after the start of the
reaction is shown over increasing nsp5 concentrations. Experiment was done in triplicate.

Figure 5: Antiviral activity of selected hits against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells
A) Schematic overview of the viral infectivity assay in Vero E6 cells. Vero E6 cells were
seeded in a 96-well format and treated with compounds at the indicated concentrations. This
was followed by infection with SARS-CoV-2 isolate at a MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell. Afterwards,
cells were fixed, stained for DNA with Draq7 and SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleocapsid protein (N
protein) with an Alexa-488 labelled antibody and imaged (see Zeng et al. this issue).

Figure S1: Testing reaction buffers for high-throughput screening
A - B) Increase in fluorescence over time after initiation of nsp5 protease FRET-based assay
onto either DMSO or water via hand pipetting (A) or via an automated liquid handling robot
(B). Experiments were done in triplicate.
C) The nsp5 protease FRET-based assay was monitored for increase in fluorescence over
time in standard buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.6, 2 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA) onto either
DMSO or water. 10% glycerol or 0.02% Tween are added to the standard reaction buffer
which is dispensed onto either DMSO or water.
Figure S2: IC50 values and related figures of all hits
A-D) In vitro activity of nsp5 was measured over a wide-range concentrations of different
inhibitors using the FRET-based assay. A dose response curve for an IC50 value was
determined by non-linear regression (shown in black) for all drugs where possible. Drugs are
sorted into different stages of validation. All FRET-based data are shown as mean ± SEM,
n=3, error bars represent SD. For select compounds a nsp9 gel-based assay was done at a
wide range of drug concentrations.
(D) Calpain Inhibitor I, Z-VAD-FMK, Z-DEVD-FMK and Z-IETD-FMK were all validated as
specific nsp5 inhibitors. FRET-based assay dose dependent curves are shown with IC50
values determined by non-linear regression with normalised data alongside relevant
chemical structures. All data are shown as mean ± SD, n=3, error bars represent SD.

Tables
Table 1: Full primary hit list
Table showing ranked initial hits with compound name, fluorescence reading type and
percentage inhibition at both primary screen concentrations (4 and 0.8 µM). Those with
“HIGH” fluorescence readings were either reading at over the detectable range in the screen
wavelength or completely saturated. Such a reading would result in a decreased rate in
reaction due to how reaction rates were determined via MATLAB. Those reading at
“moderate’ had slightly increased fluorescence at both screen concentrations, but a rate of
reaction could still be determined. Finally, those with “normal” fluorescence readings were
drugs that did not interfere with the fluorescence signal at the primary screen emission
wavelength at all.
Table 2: Final hit list
Table showing the final four hits from the HTS. The chemical name, structure and IC50
values as determined by non-linear regression are shown.
