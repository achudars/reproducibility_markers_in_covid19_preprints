Abstract
In vitro antibody selection against pathogens from naïve combinatorial libraries can yield
various classes of antigen-specific binders that are distinct from those evolved from
natural infection1-4. Also, rapid neutralizing antibody discovery can be made possible by
a strategy that selects for those interfering with pathogen and host interaction5. Here we
report the discovery of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for
the COVID-19 pandemic, from a highly diverse naïve human Fab library. Lead antibody
5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of
Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial
epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its
neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs
at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the “up” and the other in the “down” position,
explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several
spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has
become dominant worldwide. Our results suggest that 5A6 could be an effective
prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 originating
in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, is one of the world’s most devastating pandemics in living
memory. As of July 1 2020, more than 10.7 million individuals have been infected worldwide
resulting in nearly 518,000 deaths, and the numbers are still increasing. Currently only a single
FDA-approved drug, Remdesivir, is available against COVID-19 and yet, it only shortened the
duration of symptoms by 31% and had marginal improvement in survival, especially in the
severely ill cases6. In this context, additional and more effective prophylactic and therapeutic
drugs are urgently needed.

The coronavirus spike polypeptide comprises two subunits, S1 and S2, and is responsible for
mediating viral entry7. Upon binding to the host cell receptor through its S1 subunit, the spike
protein undergoes dramatic conformational changes and proteolytic processing, triggering the
S2 subunit to facilitate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry receptor to infect host cells810

. The receptor binding domain (RBD) located at the tip of the S1 subunit directly contacts

ACE2 via the receptor binding motif (RBM), a small patch made up of about 20 amino acids11,
12

. Thus, a rational approach to the development of the anti-SARS-COV or anti-SARS-COV-2

therapy is to explicitly direct antibody discovery against the RBD/ACE2 interaction interface13.

Since the first report of COVID-19 outbreak, discovery of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
monocloncal antibodies (NAbs) has undergone an unprecedent speed. Some existing potent
SARS-CoV NAbs that target the RBD/ACE2 interaction were quickly tested for their crossreactivity against SARS-CoV-2 because of the high similarity between the two viruses10, 14, 15,
yet only very few showed potent neutralization15-18. Meanwhile, many SARS-CoV-2-specific
NAbs have been discovered from immunized animals19-21 and COVID-19 convalescent

patients21-30. Structural and biochemical studies indicated that most of these NAbs recognized
epitopes within the ACE2 binding site, imposing direct competition between virus-ACE2
interaction21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28. Other antibodies were found to bind to epitopes that are outside the
RBM18, 19, 21 or even the RBD23, 24, suggesting that various mechanisms of neutralization exist.
A number of these neutralizing antibodies have just entered clinical trials21.
In addition to those derived from natural infection or immunization, potent neutralizing
antibodies against pathogens can be isolated by in vitro selection from highly diverse
combinatorial human libraries1-3. Interestingly, some of such antibodies often came from
different antibody subtypes and recognized different epitopes31. Following the release of the
first SARS-CoV-2 genome, we set out to discover SARS CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies from
a highly diverse human combinatorial antbody libray using a mechanism-based screening
strategy. Here, we report the discovery of a potent NAb 5A6 with functional characterization
in CHO-ACE2, Vero E6 cell line, and reconstituted human respiratory epithelium models, and
reveal its molecular mechanism of action through cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM).
Furthermore, the cross-neutralizing activity of 5A6 against major SARS-CoV-2 mutants is
demonstrated, further highlighting its potential as a COVID-19 therapy.

Results and Discussions

Isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Fabs from a naïve human
Fab phage display library
The naïve human Fab phage display library used in this project was constructed using
the B cells donated by 22 healthy individuals, and has a diversity of 3 x 1010 clones32. To isolate
neutralizing antibodies, we directed antibody selection against the recombinant SARS-CoV-2
S protein RBD14, the domain responsible for viral attachment to the host receptor ACE2 as
previously discussed. Following stringent in vitro selection conditions and only two rounds of
biopanning, ELISA screening of 570 individual clones identified 243 Fabs that were able to
bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. While several anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been
reported to neutralize the virus by unclear mechanisms19, 26, to be expeditious, we took a direct,
mechanism-based approach by screening for those Fabs that block the RBD/ACE2 interaction
in a competition ELISA. Fabs were incubated with RBD before transfer to ELISA plate wells
coated with the recombinant ACE2 protein, and the extent of RBD/ACE2 blocking was
determined by the presence of ACE2-bound RBD. Twenty-seven Fabs with unique sequences
exhibiting various degrees of blocking were identified (Fig. 1a). Binding characteristics of
these Fabs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein are shown in Figure 1b. Of the 27 selected
clones, 19 clones were reformatted into full length IgGs, expressed recombinantly in CHO
cells, and their binding to the RBD confirmed by concentration-dependent ELISA (Extended
Data Fig. 1). Six antibodies, clones 1F4, 2H4, 3D11, 3F11, 5A6 and 6F8, showed strong
receptor blocking by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 1c) and in competition ELISA, with
IC50 values ranging between 0.4 nM and 36.8 nM (Extended Data Fig. 2). All six completely
blocked the RBD/ACE2 interaction at high concentrations, except clone 3D11 which plateaued
at 50%. Two Fabs, 5A6 and 3D11 showed the highest affinities for RBD at 7.6 nM and 1.6 nM

respectively, presumably because of their slower relative off rates (Fig. 1d, Extended Data
Fig. 3). The Fabs had intrinsic affinity varying from 1.6 nM (3D11) to 120 nM (3F11). They
also varied by two orders of magnitude in their association and dissociation rates with 3F11
having the fastest on-rate and 3D11 having the slowest off-rate. The IgG format showed strong,
subnano- or even picomolar binding avidity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD either by BLI (Fig.
1e, Extended Data Fig. 4) or by ELISA (Extended Data Fig. 5). Interestingly, only 3D11 was
able to cross react with SARS-CoV spike RBD, although the binding was much weaker
(Extended Data Fig. 5). The data suggest that 3D11 recognizes a distinct epitope that is
different from the other five antibodies and is conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV. Indeed, stepwise binding BLI assays confirmed that 5A6 and 3D11 have non-overlapping
footprints on the RBD while 5A6 shares overlapping epitopes with the other four antibodies
(Fig. 1f).
To evaluate the neutralization potential of these SARS-CoV-2 RBD reactive antibodies,
we generated pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein tagged
with a luciferase reporter, and established a pseudovirus neutralization assay featuring CHO
cells stably expressing human ACE2 (CHO-ACE2) as viral targets. All six antibodies showed
dose-dependent neutralization (Fig. 2a). 5A6 strongly neutralized the SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus with an IC50 of 75.5 ng/ml, followed by 1F4 (108 ng/ml), 2H4 (109 ng/ml), 6F8
(428.3 ng/ml), and 3F11 (930.4 ng/ml). Interestingly, while 3D11 neutralized SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus, the neutralization did not follow the typical sigmoidal dose response, suggesting
a unique mechanism of inhibition. Consistent with our binding studies, none of these antibodies
showed significant neutralization of the SARS-CoV pseudovirus, suggesting high specificity
of our antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, although 3D11 was able to bind weakly to the
SARS-CoV RBD (Extended Data Fig. 5), it was unable to significantly neutralize SARS-CoV
pseudovirus (Fig. 2a). These six antibodies were further evaluated in Vero E6 cells for

neutralizing activity against a clinical SARS-CoV-2 strain, isolated from a patient in
Singapore33. The 5 antibodies other than 3F11 showed >90% neutralization at the highest
concentration (12.5 µg/ml), with 5A6 exhibiting an IC50 of 140.7 ng/ml, indicating >10-fold
higher neutralizing potency than the other clones (Fig. 2b). In addition, 5A6 also potently
neutralized a viral strain isolated in France with an IC50 of approximately 5 ng/ml (Fig. 2c).
The difference between patient isolates is of unclear origin as they share identical spike
sequences, but may be due to intrinsic properties such as rate of replication controlled by other
viral genes.
To explore the therapeutic potential of 5A6, we studied its neutralizing potency in
physiologically relevant in vitro models. Human airway epithelia reconstituted using donorderived, primary differentiated nasal and bronchial cells (MucilAirTM HAE34) were infected
with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence or absence of 5A6 or an equivalent isotype control
IgG. Viral replication was quantified as the measured copy number of the viral genomes inside,
and at the apical poles of, nasal and bronchial HAE. Figure 2d shows that viral replication was
drastically reduced, being 103 to 104-fold lower in the presence of 5A6 (75 or 150 ng/ml), while
control IgG had little-to-no effect on infection. In addition, 5A6 also helped maintain
epithelium integrity in the presence of virus, as evidenced by measurements of trans-epithelia
electrical resistance. These results provided strong evidence in favour of the therapeutic
potential of 5A6.

Mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization by 5A6
Given that viral neutralization IC50s are more similar in general to the binding avidity
than to the intrinsic affinity, we hypothesized that 5A6 neutralized the virus via bivalent
binding to spike proteins on the viral surface. To support this hypothesis, we compared the
neutralization potencies of the monovalent Fab to the bivalent IgG. A pseudovirus

neutralization assay showed that the monovalent 5A6 Fab (IC50=663.9 ng/m, Extended Data
Fig. 6a) had a 10-fold reduction in the neutralization potency relative to the bivalent 5A6 IgG
(IC50=75.5 ng/ml, Fig. 2a). Reduction of neutralizing potency was also observed for the other
Fabs (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Furthermore, the neutralization potency of the Fabs was also
drastically reduced or even diminished in a live virus neutralization assay (Extended Data Fig.
6b), consistent with results using pseudovirus. This suggested that 5A6 IgG neutralizes the
SARS-CoV-2 virus via bivalent binding to the spike protein or by crosslinking multiple spike
protein trimers. However, while IgGs 1F4, 2H4, 3D11, 3F11 and 6F8 have similar or higher
avidity for immobilized RBD, 5A6 has much higher neutralizing potency against both
pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We asked if the discrepancy could arise from the
differences in structural arrangement between the artificially immobilized RBD proteins and
the natural RBD displayed on the viral surface. To answer this question, we purified the SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus by gradient centrifugation and immobilized the viral particles on the
ELISA plates. Concentration-dependent binding curves revealed that 5A6 IgG was packed on
the viral surface at a much higher density than the other four IgG antibodies or 5A6 Fab, as
shown by the higher optical signal (Fig. 1g). This may be a result of a unique binding mode
that allows 5A6 IgG to accommodate a denser structural arrangement on the viral surface. To
this end, it has been well documented that effective viral neutralization requires antibody
packing density exceeding a critical threshold35-37, a criterion that was perhaps not easily
achieved by the other five antibodies.

Structural basis of viral neutralization by antibody 5A6
To better understand the molecular mechanism of 5A6 bioactivity, we determined
single-particle cryo-EM structures of the trimeric spike protein alone at 2.4 Å resolution (not
shown) and in complex with 5A6 Fab at 2.4 Å (Fig. 3, Supplementary Movie 1, and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.203414; this version posted July 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Extended Data Fig. 7). In the uncomplexed spike protein structure, individual RBDs are seen
adopting two major conformations, here termed “up” and “down.” As previously reported, the
resolution of an apo RBD in the up conformation is limited by its flexibility8. In the spike
protein-5A6 Fab complex structure, the Fab hypervariable loops bind directly to surface loops
at the tip of RBD. The RBD binding epitope of 5A6 (850 Å2) overlaps the binding site of the
ACE2 receptor suggesting direct, competitive inhibition of ACE2 binding and confirming the
mechanism based biopanning strategy for identification of ACE2 blockers (Fig. 3b). 3D
classification of the spike protein-5A6 Fab complex dataset reveals several different subclasses
in which the Fab occupancies in the trimer varies with two hallmark features. One striking
highlight is that 5A6 Fab can bind to RBD in both up and down conformations while engaging
the same epitope (Fig. 3a-c). While the orientations of the three RBDs within the trimer are
different, the atomic resolution model built from one 5A6-RBD interface is superimposable
with the other 5A6-RBD structures, and no steric clashes result from modelling any
configuration of the complex. The resolution of our structure at the interface between 5A6 Fab
and RBD is sufficiently high (~2.7 Å local resolution) to allow accurate modelling of the
5A6/RBD interface (Fig. 3d). Four of the six complementary determining regions (CDRs) of
5A6, namely, loops H1, H2, H3 and L1 are involved in binding to RBD. A surfeit of tyrosines
from H1 (Tyr 32), H2 (Tyr 53 and Tyr 59), L1 (Tyr 32), and L3 (Tyr 92), as well as Arg 98,
Thr 101, Val 103 and Arg 104 in the H3 loop cooperate to stabilize the interface. These
interactions provide a structural framework that suggests why 5A6 is not affected by the V483I
mutation while Leu 94 in the L3 loop is a potential liability in binding to the 483A mutation.
The second hallmark feature is that two 5A6 Fabs are always found binding two
neighbouring RBDs, one in an up position and one in a down position. A region of the light
chain variable sequence of 5A6 that binds to the RBD in the down position forms a second
interaction interface of 363 Å2 with a neighbouring RBD in the up position (Fig. 3e). This

interaction presumably contributes to locking the first RBD in the down conformation, and
further stabilizes RBD in the up conformation, as it is better resolved than other RBDs in the
up position with or without Fab bound. Notably, the constant domain of 5A6 bound to the down
RBD unavoidably clashes with the model of ACE2 bound to the neighbouring up RBD (Fig.
3b left), perhaps further potentiating neutralization.
The distances between all Fabs bound to a single trimer are sufficiently close to allow
two Fabs from a single IgG to bind simultaneously to two different RBDs within the trimer,
and we reasoned that binding mode might explain the strong avidity and high surface density
of 5A6 IgG discussed above. We therefore applied single-particle cryo-EM to the spike protein
complexed with 5A6 IgG, and the resulting ~15 Å structure reveals that 5A6 IgG indeed binds
to two RBDs from the same trimer (Fig. 3f). While the Fc domain of the IgG is not well
resolved, due to conformational flexibility and the tendency of the IgG to induce spike
aggregation, the density clearly indicates that two Fabs from the same IgG prefer binding to
two neighbouring RBDs in up and down conformations, just as described above for free 5A6
Fab. Thus, one spike protein trimer can accommodate 1.5 IgGs with a single IgG binding two
RBDs and the third RBD bound to another IgG, potentially bridging separate spike protein
trimers.
Remarkably, 5A6 directly competes with ACE2, binds any configuration of trimer
RBD conformations without steric hindrance from either the spike protein or other Fabs,
permits binding of IgG with unaltered geometry, and may disrupt cooperative opening of the
entire trimer by locking adjacent RBDs into up and down conformations.

Sensitivity of 5A6 and 3D11 to RBD mutations
A number of mutations resulting in amino acid changes in positions at or near the
ACE2 interface have been isolated within more than 40,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced

to date. These include N439K in 246 samples (244 Scottish, 1 England, 1 Romania), V483A
in 30 samples (26 USA/WA, 2 USA/UN, 1 USA/CT, 1 England), G476S in 18 samples (13
USA/WA, 2 USA/OR, 1 USA/ID, 1 USA/CT, 1 Belgium), S494P in 7 samples (3 USA/MI, 1
England, 1 Spain, 1 India, 1 Sweden), V483I in 2 English samples, and L455I together with
F456V in one Brazilian sample. To determine if any of these mutant viruses could escape
neutralization by 5A6 or 3D11, we produced the recombinant mutant RBD proteins to
determine changes in binding avidity, and constructed mutant SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses to
evaluate changes in neutralization potency. 5A6 IgG had a 4-fold reduction in binding avidity
to the V483A mutation but was insensitive to the other five mutations (Fig. 4a, Extended Data
Fig. 8a). Consistent with the binding results, 5A6 significantly lost neutralizing capacity
against the V483A mutant pseudovirus. However, 5A6 largely retains activity against the other
variants (Fig. 4c), including the D614G mutation that has spread at an alarming rate and
become the dominant pandemic strain with a global frequency of 70.5% (GISAID), since its
first identification in Europe in March38. Interestingly, 3D11 binding was not affected by any
of these mutations (Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 8b), but its neutralizing potency against the
D614G mutant was partially reduced (Fig. 4d). The difference between the activity profiles of
5A6 and 3D11 could be explained by the different epitopes recognized by each antibody (Fig.
1f), and may argue for an antibody combination therapy to widen the neutralization spectrum
against various mutant strains. While 3D11 has a weaker neutralizing potency than 5A6 in
general, it can be further improved through antibody engineering, particularly via structureguided approaches once high-resolution structures of its spike protein complex are determined.
Hence, 3D11 could potentially rescue the loss of 5A6 neutralization potency in a virus strain
bearing the V483A mutation, if these two antibodies are used in combination. Further structureaided engineering is underway to broaden the neutralizing spectrum of 5A6 against other
mutations.

In summary, our study demonstrates that potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies can be rapidly discovered within a highly diverse, naïve combinatorial human
antibody library using a mechanism-based screening strategy. Antibody 5A6 neutralizes
SARS-CoV-2 by simultaneously binding to two RBDs of different structural orientations in
the spike trimer, and prevents ACE2 binding by direct competition. The high resolution
structures of the 5A6/RBD complex reveal details of extensive tertiary interactions, and greater
neutralization potency, including against viruses with variant RBDs, can likely be achieved
through structure-guided engineering, paving the way for the development of effective
therapeutics for COVID-19.

Supplementary Movie 1 for additional viewing angles. b, Structural basis for virus
neutralization by 5A6 binding to the ACE2-spike interface. Host receptor ACE2 (PDB 6m17,
purple) is overlaid on the 5A6 (goldenrod) bound to spike RBD (green), revealing occlusion of
the ACE2 binding site by 5A6. Red spheres indicate previously identified RBD mutations
(N439, L455, F456, G476, V483, S494, and D614). Only V483 lies directly in the epitope. c,
Fab 5A6 recognizes a complex tertiary epitope, and preferentially binds in a 2:1 complex to
adjacent RBDs, one in the “down” conformation (spike monomer A) and the other in the “up”
conformation (monomer B). The third RBD may be in either conformation, and either free or
bound to another Fab. The A monomer with Fab bound to the epitope is shown left. A 120°
rotation around the C3 axis, to the B monomer, reveals a secondary contact between the Fab
light chain and B monomer (right). Dotted boxes show the regions focused in panels E and E,
as indicated, and colors match those previous panels. d, Close-up of the 5A6 epitope
corresponding to the labelled box in panel C. Fab residues mentioned in the text are indicated
with dark blue labels for heavy chain, and dark orange for light chain. e, Close-up of the
secondary contact between 5A6 light chain and the adjacent RBD, corresponding to the
labelled box in panel C. Several close contacts and hydrogen bonds are formed at this additional
interface, likely responsible for stabilizing the conformation of spike monomer A (“down”
RBD). f, Cryo-EM density of an IgG bearing two copies of 5A6 bound to the spike trimer at
~15 Å resolution, with a binding mode congruent to that shown for the 5A6 Fab in the other
