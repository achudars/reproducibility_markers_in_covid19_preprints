Abstract

28

SARS-CoV-2 is a causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic and the development of

29

therapeutic interventions is urgently needed. So far, monoclonal antibodies and drug

30

repositioning are the main methods for drug development and this effort was partially

31

successful. Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2

32

variants has been reported in many parts of the world and the main concern is whether the

33

current vaccines and therapeutics are still effective against these variant viruses. The viral

34

entry and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are the main targets of current drug

35

development, thus the inhibitory effects of TMPRSS2 and RdRp inhibitors were compared

36

among the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate (lineage A) and the two recent variants (lineage B.1.1.7

37

and lineage B.1.351) identified in the UK and South Africa, respectively. Our in vitro analysis

38

of viral replication showed that the drugs targeting TMPRSS2 and RdRp are equally effective

39

against the two variants of concern.

Introduction

43

COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute

44

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1) and it was declared as a pandemic by

45

the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. In order to address this

46

unprecedented global challenge, intensive investigations have been simultaneously conducted

47

by global scientific communities and industries to develop diagnostic tools, vaccines, and

48

therapeutics. Remarkably, within ten months after release of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

49

sequence, a couple of vaccines were successfully developed and are now being used for

50

vaccination of people after emergency use authorization (EUA). Drug development was also

51

partially successful, especially in the development of monoclonal antibodies (2)(3). Notably,

52

the vaccines and monoclonal antibodies currently being used are heavily dependent on the

53

structure and sequence of viral Spike protein, which is a surface glycoprotein responsible for

54

virus entry by interacting with the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

55

Thus, if there is any mutation in this protein, it is likely to affect the efficacy of both vaccines

56

and antibodies.

57

Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in

58

many parts of the world and the recent variants identified in the UK (lineage B.1.1.7), South

59

Africa (lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (lineage P.1) are of particular concern due to multiple

60

mutations in the Spike gene (Figure 1) (4)(5). Indeed, several results are being published,

61

which demonstrated reduced neutralization capacity of convalescent plasma, vaccine sera,

62

and monoclonal antibodies against these variants (6)(7)(8)(9).

63

In addition to monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors are also being developed as

64

potential antiviral agents. Targets of such small molecule inhibitors are often transmembrane

65

serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) (10)(11)(12)(13) and viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

66

(RdRp) (14)(15). TMPRSS2 is known to possess serine protease activity, which primes the

67

viral Spike protein for fusion between the viral membrane and the host cell membrane prior

68

to the release of viral genome into the cytoplasm. Camostat and nafamostat are representative

69

drug candidates as TMPRSS2 inhibitors and currently being tested in several phase 2 and 3

70

clinical trials in many countries. On the other hand, RdRp is a target of remdesivir, which is

71

the first approved drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients (16).

72

In this study, we investigated whether the antiviral drug candidates targeting TMPRSS2 and

3

73

RdRp are still effective against the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern by assessing in

74

vitro viral replication capacity after drug treatment.

75
76

Results and Discussion

77

The alignment of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences of two lineages (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351)

78

identified numerous changes compared to the sequence of the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate

79

(lineage A) and several of them were located in the Spike protein (Figure 1) while no change

80

was observed in the NSP12 amino acid sequence which possesses an RdRp activity.

81

In order to compare the drug susceptibilities against the three lineages of SARS-CoV-2, both

82

Vero and Calu-3 cells were used for virus infection and drug treatment. Drugs were added to

83

the cells prior to the virus infection. The cells were fixed at 24 h post infection and scored by

84

immunofluorescence analysis with an antibody specific for the viral N protein. The

85

microscopic images of both viral N protein and cell nuclei were analyzed using the Columbus

86

software and the dose-response curve (DRC) for each drug and variant was generated

87

(Figures 2 and 3).

88

We tested four different TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat, nafamostat, aprotinin, and

89

bromhexine) (17), two RdRp inhibitors (remdesivir, EIDD-2801 (molnupiravir), and EIDD-

90

1931 (an active form of EIDD-2801)) (14)(15), and others (niclosamide and ciclesonide) that

91

we had identified in our earlier drug repositioning study (13)(18). The antiviral drug efficacy

92

of each drug was compared among the three lineages of SARS-CoV-2; A (an early SARS-

93

CoV-2 isolate), B.1.1.7 (identified in the UK) and B.1.351 (identified in South Africa).

94

While TMPRSS2 inhibitors did not show any antiviral effect in Vero cells as reported

95

previously (Figure 2) (13), they were very effective in suppressing viral replication in Calu-3

96

cells, perhaps due to the abundant TMPRSS2 expression in this cell line (19) without

97

substantial differences in drug efficacy among the three lineages of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3).

98

TMPRSS2 cleaves the Spike protein at the S2’ cleavage site and no sequence change was

99

observed at or near this site in the two recent variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) compared to the

100

sequence of the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate (lineage A) (Figure 1). Perhaps, the conserved

101

sequence at this region could account for the similar drug efficacy among the three lineages.

102

The amino acid sequence of NSP12 was also well conserved among the three lineages of

103

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1) and we did not find any substantial differences among them with

104

regard to drug efficacy of the two representative RdRp inhibitors (remdesivir and

105

molnupiravir) (Figures 2 and 3). Both remdesivir and molnupiravir are nucleoside analogs

106

but the two drugs differ from each other in that remdesivir works as a chain terminator but

107

molnupiravir induces mutations during viral RNA replication. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) is a

108

prodrug of β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931) and it has well-known broad-spectrum

109

antiviral activity against various RNA viruses (20)(21)(22)(23). Since this drug is orally

110

available, it could be easily administered for the patients even with mild COVID-19 if it is

111

successfully developed. Currently, phase 2 and 3 clinical trials are being conducted globally

112

for this new drug candidate.

113

Finally, we assessed the antiviral drug efficacy of niclosamide and ciclesonide and no

114

substantial differences in drug efficacy was observed among the three lineages (Figures 2 and

115

3). This result suggests that the potential targets of these drugs lie outside of the substituted

116

amino acids in the two variants. Currently, niclosamide and ciclesonide are being tested in

117

several clinical trials to assess antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

118

Most of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccines that are being used for

119

treatment or prevention of COVID-19 were developed to target the viral Spike protein,

120

specifically, the receptor-binding domain. While this protein is abundant and more

121

immunogenic than the other viral proteins, it is also the place where many mutations occur

122

(e.g., N501Y, E484K, K417N) due to potential viral adaptations and various selective

123

pressures, etc. Of these mutations, some are known to substantially reduce neutralization

124

capacity of monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccine sera. Hence, it is very

125

important to develop therapeutics targeting viral or host factors other than the Spike protein

126

in order to address potential resistance issues caused by the Spike mutations.

127

In summary, we analyzed efficacy of potential drug candidates (i.e., TMPRSS2 inhibitors,

128

RdRp inhibitors and others) against the recent SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and we

129

found that all of them were equally effective in suppressing replication of B.1.1.7 and

130

B.1.351 variants compared to the early SARS-CoV-2 isolate. The results from this study

131

would help develop therapeutic interventions specifically targeting TMPRSS2, RdRp or other

132

viral and host factors.

143

supplemented with 20% heat‐inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% MEM-Non-Essential

144

Amino Acid solution (Gibco) and 2% antibiotic‐antimycotic solution (Gibco). Three lineages

145

of SARS‐CoV‐2 were provided by Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA),

146

and were propagated in Vero E6 cells. Each lineage is noted as lineage A (an early SARS-

147

CoV-2 isolate) (hCoV-19/Korea/KCDC03/2020), lineage B.1.1.7 (hCoV-

148

19/Korea/KDCA51463/2021), and lineage B.1.351 (hCoV-19/Korea/KDCA55905/2021) in

149

this study. Viral titers were determined by plaque assays in Vero cells. All experiments using

150

SARS‐CoV‐2 were performed at Institut Pasteur Korea in compliance with the guidelines of

151

the KNIH, using enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL‐3) containment procedures in laboratories

152

approved for use by the KDCA.

Vero cells were seeded at 1.0 × 104 cells per well with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

165

(DMEM; Welgene) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2%

166

antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco) in a black, 384‐well, μClear plates (Greiner Bio‐One)

167

24 hours before the experiment. Calu-3 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 104 cells per well with

168

Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 20% heat-

169

inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% MEM-Non-Essential Amino Acid solution (Gibco)

170

and 2% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Gibco) in a black, 384‐well, μClear plates (Greiner

171

Bio‐One) 24 hours before the experiment. Ten‐point DRCs were generated with three-fold

172

dilutions, with compound concentrations ranging from 0.0025 to 50 μM. Only nafamostat

173

and camostat used a top concentration of 5 μM instead of 50 μM, thus concentrations ranged

174

from 0.00025 to 50 μM. For viral infection, plates were transferred into the BSL‐3

175

containment facility and SARS‐CoV‐2 was added at a multiplicity of infection of 0.008 for

176

Vero cells and 0.2 for Calu-3 cells. The plates were incubated at 37ºC for 24 hours. The cells

177

were fixed at 24 hours post infection (hpi) with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized

178

with 0.25% Triton X-100 solution. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) primary antibody,

179

488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342 were treated to

180

the cells for immunofluorescence. The images acquired with Operetta high-throughput

181

imaging device (Perkin Elmer) were analyzed using the Columbus software (Perkin Elmer) to

182

quantify cell numbers and infection ratios. Antiviral activity was normalized to infection

183

control (0.5% DMSO) in each assay plate. Cell viability was measured by counting nuclei in

184

each well and normalizing it to the mock control. DRCs were generated using Prism7

185

software (GraphPad). IC50 values were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis –

186

log[inhibitor] vs. response – Variable slope (four parameters). All IC50 and CC50 values were

187

measured in duplicates.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SARS-CoV-2

309

variants. Three SARS-CoV-2 lineages were used in this study; lineage A (an early SARS-

310

CoV-2 isolate), lineage B.1.1.7 (identified in the UK), and lineage B.1.351 (identified in

311

South Africa). SNPs that are observed in B.1.351 compared to the early isolate are noted in

312

red above the diagram. SNPs observed in B.1.1.7 compared to the early isolate are noted in

313

green below the diagram. NTD (N-terminal domain); RBD (receptor-binding domain); FP
