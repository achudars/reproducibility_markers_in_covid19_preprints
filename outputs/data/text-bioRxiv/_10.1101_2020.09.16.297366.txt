Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The initial interaction between Transmembrane Serine
Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) primed SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and host cell receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is a pre-requisite step for this novel
coronavirus pathogenesis. Here, we expressed a GFP-tagged SARS-CoV-2 SEctodomain in Tni insect cells. That contained sialic acid-enriched N- and O-glycans.
Surface resonance plasmon (SPR) and Luminex assay showed that the purified SEctodomain binding to human ACE-2 and immunoreactivity with COVID-19 positive
samples. We demonstrate that bromelain (isolated from pineapple stem and used as a
dietary supplement) treatment diminishes the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 in
VeroE6 cells and dramatically lowers the expression of S-Ectodomain. Importantly,
bromelain treatment reduced the interaction between S-Ectodomain and VeroE6 cells.
Most importantly, bromelain treatment significantly diminished the SARS-CoV-2 infection
in VeroE6 cells. Altogether, our results suggest that bromelain or bromelain rich pineapple
stem may be used as an antiviral against COVID-19.

Introduction
The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
transmit rapidly from human-to-human resulted in ongoing pandemic. Older adults and
people who have pre-existing conditions like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and
cancers are at increased risk for developing severe complications from COVID-19 illness,
including death. As of September 14, 2020, over 28,918,900 people have been infected
worldwide with 922,252 deaths, of which 6,426,958 people in the US have been infected
with 192,612 deaths (1). SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE-2 expressing lung, kidney, and
testicular tissues of patients, which may lead to organ failure and sometimes death (2, 3).
The SARS-CoV-2 homotrimeric viral spike protein (S1) binds to the host cell’s receptor
ACE-2 for initial entry, followed by S2-mediated membrane fusion (4, 5). The S-protein
undergoes proteolytic priming by TMPRSS2, which is expressed on the host cell surface
(6). TMPRSS2 is a 70 kDa type II transmembrane glycoprotein with serine protease
activity and expressed in many tissues (7). TMPRSS2 is predicted to have nine stabilizing
disulfide bonds and two N-glycan sites (UniProtKB - O15393). TMPRSS2 priming activity
is essential for many viral infections, including influenza A virus (8, 9), SARS-CoV (10),
and SARS-CoV-2 (6). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein is a heavily glycosylated
transmembrane glycoprotein contains 1273 amino acids. It has several functional
domains, including N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), fusion
peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1(HR1), central helix (CH), connector domain (CD),
transmembrane domain (TM), and a cytoplasmic tail (CT) (11). Recently, studies have
demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has 22 N-linked and 2 O-linked glycan
sites. Mostly these N-glycans are composed of oligomannose, hybrid and complex type,

and the O-glycans are core 1 derived structures, which may play a significant role in
protein folding, receptor binding, and immune escape (12-14).
Currently, COVID-19 patients are treated with a different antiviral (Favilavir and
Remdesivir) (15-17), antimalarial (Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine) (18), viral
protease inhibitors (Lopinavir and Darunavir) (18, 19), and anti-inflammatory agent
(Tocilizumab) (20). However, the response rate is modest, and the safety and efficacy of
those drugs against COVID-19 still needs to be further confirmed by clinical trials. Hence,
there is an emergent need to repurpose existing drugs or develop new virus-based and
host-based antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we explored the effect of bromelain on
host cell receptor ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain. Bromelain is
isolated from pineapple stem, a cysteine protease, and is used as a dietary supplement
for treating patients with pain and inflammation (21) and thrombosis (22). Here, we show
that bromelain inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6 cells via altering the expression
of ACE-2, TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein.

Results and Discussion
Bromelain inhibits the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2
Recently, studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein utilizes human ACE-2 as
receptor for viral entry (4, 5). Hence, we explored the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2
in various normal and cancerous cells. Of several normal and cancerous cells tested,
VeroE6 and Calu-3 cells showed ACE-2 protein expression (Figure 1A), as well as basal
level of TMPRSS2 protein (Figure 1B). It has been demonstrated that human ACE-2 is a
type I transmembrane glycoprotein composed of 805 amino acids. It has an extracellular
N-terminal domain that contains a zinc metallopeptidase domain (HEXH motif) and Cterminal domain (23, 24). ACE-2 has 7 potential N-glycosylation and 3 O-glycosylation
sites, which may play a major role in protein folding and viral binding (13). The zinc
metallopeptidase domain is responsible for binding to viral spike protein. ACE-2
extracellular domain has six cysteine residues with three stabilizing disulfide bonds (25).
Additionally, TMPRSS2 is predicted to have 18 cysteine residues with nine stabilizing
disulfide bonds in its extracellular domain (UniProtKB - O15393). Since ACE-2 and
TMPRSS2 are enriched with cysteine residues that form disulfide bonds to stabilize the
protein structure, we investigated the effect of bromelain (cysteine protease) on ACE-2
and TMPRSS2 expression. Bromelain reduces the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2
in a dose-dependent (19, 37 and 75 µg/ml / 48 h) manner in VeroE6 cells (Figure 1C).
Since bromelain took 48 hours to reduce the expression of ACE-2 in complete media, we
investigated whether bromelain’s inhibitory effect is a direct or indirect action on these
two proteins. For this, we treated VeroE6 cells with bromelain (75 ug/ml) in a shorter
period (0-4 h) with serum-free conditions. Interestingly, bromelain reduced the expression

of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 at an early time-points onward (2 h) (Figure 1D). However,
bromelain’s cysteine proteolytic activity was higher in ACE-2 than TMPRSS2. Next, we
confirmed the bromelain’s activity by treating recombinant TMPRSS2 (Abnova, CA, USA)
that showed a complete loss of TMPRSS2 (Figure 1E). We further validated these results
by incubating VeroE6 cells with a cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (4 µM) along with
bromelain (75 µg/ml) and showed an intact ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 protein expression as
compared to bromelain alone (Figure 1F). These results suggest that bromelain’s
cysteine protease activity reduces the expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 in VeroE6
cells. Since VeroE6 cells expressed ACE-2 and basal levels of TMPRSS2, and SARSCoV-2 can infect VeroE6 cells (26, 27), we utilized this cell line for the rest of the studies.

Bromelain cleaves SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
Studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a 10 to 20-fold higher binding
affinity with ACE-2 as compared to SARS-CoV-1 spike protein for viral pathogenesis (28).
Hence, we cloned and expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain that contains
insect cell secretion signal (SP), NTD, RBD, FP, HR1, CH, and CD domains (1 -1220
amino acids) along with C-terminal GFP and 12X His tag and a mutated furin cleavage
site (Figure 2A and Figure S1). The calculated molecular weight of the purified SEctodomain-GFP protein is ~165 kDa; however, we observed a higher molecular weight
of S-Ectodomain (~215 kDa), which may be due to heavy N- and O-linked glycosylation
(Figure 2B intent). Next, we determined the interaction between the purified SEctodomain and human recombinant ACE-2 by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
technology. The SPR analysis revealed that S-Ectodomain binds with the receptor ACE-

2. Further, the binding increased in a concentration-dependent manner and has a
comparable binding affinity as control RBD binding to ACE-2 (Figure 2B). We also
validated whether the expressed S-Ectodomain can be recognized by antibodies from
COVID-19 patient samples; for this, we performed a Luminex serological assay with deidentified COVID-19 positive (n=6) and COVID-19 negative (n=6) UNMC patient samples.
Luminex assay results showed a significantly increased median fluorescent intensity
(MFI) of S-Ectodomain with COVID-19 positive patients’ samples (P<0.0001) (Figure 2C).
These results indicate that the purified S-Ectodomain is correctly folded and active. Since
S-Ectodomain has 22 N-glycosylation and 2 O-glycosylation sites (12-15), we explored
the type of glycosylation on the purified S-Ectodomain. Figure 2D shows the schematic
representation of the N- and O-linked glycosylation sites in S-protein (12, 13). Treatment
of S-Ectodomain with N-glycanase (PNGase F) showed increased mobility shift and
destabilization of the protein, which may be due to the loss of heavy N-glycans (Figure
2E). However, the treatment of S-Ectodomain with O-glycanase (specific for core 1 Oglycan) showed a slightly decreased protein mobility shift, which supports the previous
findings that S-protein has only two O-linked core 1 derived glycans in its RBD backbone
(Figure 2E). Conversely, treatment of S-Ectodomain with Sialidase A (which removes
sialic acid group) either alone or in combination with either N-glycanase or O-glycanase
or together induced a noticeable change in the migration of S-Ectodomain. This
decreased mobility shift of S-Ectodomain may be due to the loss of negatively charged
sialic acid groups in the N- and O-linked glycans (Figure 2E). These results indicate that
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has both highly sialylated N- and O-linked glycans.

The receptor-binding domain has five antiparallel b sheets (b1, b2, b3, b4 and b7)
with short connecting helices and loops, which form the core. Within this core structure,
there is an extended insertion like motifs called receptor binding motif (RBM), which has
contacting residues of coronavirus that bind to ACE-2 (29). SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has
30 cysteine amino acids with 15 stabilizing disulfide bonds in the Ectodomain (UniProtKB:
P0DTC2) (Figure 2F). The RBD domain alone has nine Cysteine residues, eight of which
form four disulfide linkages. Out of these four pairs, three are in the core (Cys336–
Cys361, Cys379–Cys432 and Cys391–Cys525), which help to stabilize the b sheet
structure. The remaining one pair (Cys480–Cys488) connects the loops in the distal end
of the RBM (29). Since bromelain has cysteine protease activity, we examined the effect
of bromelain on S-Ectodomain expression. Incubation of Tni insect cell supernatant
containing S-Ectodomain with bromelain showed reduced expression of S-Ectodomain in
a dose-dependent manner (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 µg/mg of total protein/hour) (Figure 2G).
Next, we investigated bromelain induced cleavage of S-Ectodomain in a time-dependent
manner. Bromelain treatment (25 µg/mg of total protein) completely cleaved SEctodomain as early as 10 min at 37oC (Figure 2H). However, a lower concentration of
bromelain (10 µg/mg of total protein) partially cleaved S-Ectodomain even up to 120 min
at 37oC (data not shown). Next, we confirmed these results by treating the purified SEctodomain with bromelain (1 µg/10 µg purified protein) shows a complete cleavage of
the S-Ectodomain in a time-dependent manner (Figure 2I). To further validate these
results, we used heat-inactivated bromelain on Tni supernatant that showed an intact SEctodomain as compared to bromelain (25 µg/mg of total protein) treatment (Figure 2J),
also we have incubated S-Ectodomain expressing Tni cells supernatant with E-64

(cysteine protease inhibitor, 1, 2 and 4 µM) plus bromelain (25 µg/mg of total protein) for
30 min, which showed an intact S-Ectodomain as compared to bromelain alone treatment
(Figure 2K). Altogether, these results demonstrate that bromelain can act as a doubleedged sword to degrade both host-derived ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and viral derived SEctodomain and thus may be predicted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Bromelain inhibits S-Ectodomain binding and SARS-CoV-2 infection
Since bromelain digested ACE-2, TMPRSS2, and S-Ectodomain, we investigated the
effect of bromelain on the interaction between S-Ectodomain and VeroE6 cells by
immunofluorescence. Interestingly, we observed a reduced binding of S-Ectodomain in
bromelain (75 µg/ml for 1 h) treated VeroE6 cells as compared to vehicle control (Figure
3A). We further confirmed these results by flow cytometry. We detected a decreased
binding of S-Ectodomain in bromelain pre-treated VeroE6 cells as compared to the
vehicle (Figure 3B, histogram). The mean fluorescent (GFP) intensity of S-Ectodomain
binding was significantly reduced in bromelain treated VeroE6 cells as compared to
vehicle (p<0.0001) (Figure 3C). To further validate these results, we incubated E-64
(cysteine protease inhibitor) plus bromelain and S-Ectodomain together with VeroE6
cells, which resulted in enhanced binding of S-Ectodomain to VeroE6 cells as compared
to bromelain alone (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that bromelain can act as a
double-edged sword by cleaving both ACE-2 and S-Ectodomain and thereby inhibit Sprotein binding in VeroE6 cells. Since bromelain inhibits S-Ectodomain binding to VeroE6
cells, we investigated the possibility of bromelain can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in
VeroE6 cells. To achieve this, we have infected vehicle control and bromelain pre-treated

VeroE6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 virus (BEI_USA-WA1/2020) titer of 0.01 MOI. The
infected cells were fixed and stained with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein specific antibody, which
showed a reduction in the number of infected cells in bromelain treatment (Figure 3E,
representative image from n=6). The percentage of green fluorescent positive cells was
quantified by using Nikon D-Elements software. We observed a significantly decreased
percentage of SARS-CoV-2 infected VeroE6 cells in bromelain treatment as compared to
the vehicle (p=0.0011) (Figure 3E). Taken together, our results indicate that that
bromelain can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6.
Recently, studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 S-protein has high
homology among other coronaviruses (76% identity with SARS-CoV) (30) with conserved
cysteine amino acids (UniProtKB: P59594). This indicates that bromelain may be used
as a broad antiviral agent against SARS-CoV2 and other related family members.
Currently used drugs against SARS-CoV-2 has potential side effects. Vaccine
trials have started against COVID-19, but a vaccine is not expected to be ready before
the end of 2020 for human use. Further, the host immune response against SARS-CoV2 is not fully understood. It differs between individuals, and also re-infection of individuals
with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical trials are ongoing with COVID-19 patients by individually
targeting either ACE-2, TMPRSS2, or Spike protein. For the first time, our results
demonstrate that bromelain can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting all three host
ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, and SARS-CoV-2 S-proteins. Also, studies have shown that
bromelain can be used to treat patients with pain and inflammation, and is well absorbed
and remains biologically active (21, 31). Therefore, either bromelain or bromelain rich

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture conditions
The African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (VeroE6, ATCC, VA, USA), human lung
adenocarcinoma cells (A549, a kind gift from Maher Abdulla, Department of Pathology
and Microbiology, UNMC and Calu-3, a kind gift from John Dickinson, Internal Medicine
Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep, UNMC), human normal bronchial
epithelial cells (BEAS-2B, a kind gift from Todd Wyatt, Internal Medicine Division of
Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep, UNMC), human Pancreatic cancer cells (T3M4, a
kind gift from Michael A Hollingsworth, Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer, UNMC),
and human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK293T, ATCC, VA, USA) were used for
this study. VeroE6, A549, T3M4, and HEK293T were grown in DMEM (Gibco, MA, USA)
with 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS, Corning, MA, USA) and 1X penicillin and
streptomycin (Corning, MA, USA). BEAS-2B cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS and
1X penicillin and streptomycin. All the cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a
humidified chamber.

Recombinant S-Ectodomain-GFP baculovirus preparation
The full-length genome sequences of 45 SARS-CoV-2 isolates were analyzed. Bat
Coronavirus genome annotations were used to map the spike protein on the Wuhan
CoVs. Multiple sequence alignment for 45 spike proteins was carried out, and the fulllength consensus sequence was derived using the Gene Calc algorithm. The membranespanning region was identified using DNAstar Protean software. The cDNA for SARSCoV-2 Spike protein ectodomain residues 1 to 1220 (S-Ectodomain-GFP) was chemically

pVL1393 (Expression Systems, CA, USA) with an insect cell secretion signal. This
construct includes complete S1 and S2 regions and ends just before the transmembrane
region (Figure S1). The furin cleavage site is mutated from RRAR to GSAS (28). Tobacco
Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site was added to the C-terminus, followed by a
flexible linker, eGFP, and 12X histidine tag. A recombinant baculovirus (P0) was
produced in SF9 cells (Expression Systems, CA, USA) as described in the protocol of the
BestBactm 2.0 Δ v-cath/ChiA Baculovirus Cotransfection Kit (Expression Systems, CA,
USA). P1 baculovirus was generated with suspended Sf9 cells (2 x106 cells/ml) with a
multiplicity of infection (MOI: number of virus particles/number of cells) of 0.1. Viral titer
was measured using a flow cytometric assay for gp64 expression (Expression Systems,
CA, USA).

Recombinant S-Ectodomain-GFP protein expression and purification
Tni cells (2x106 cells/ml) suspended in 1L of ESF-AF media at were infected with the P1
virus at an MOI of 5. Cells were harvested 72 hours post-infection by centrifugation
(500xg, 15 minutes). One cOmpleteTM ULTRA protease inhibitor tablet (Roche, MA, USA)
per liter was added before centrifugation. The supernatant was concentrated by tangential
flow filtration (TFF) using a Pellicon® 2 mini-cassette system (Millipore, MO, USA) with a
30 kDa pore size. The concentrated supernatant was adjusted to 40 mM TRIS-HCl and
1 M sodium chloride. Then the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with sodium hydroxide and was
then centrifuged (14,500xg, 30 minutes) and sterile filtered using a Thermo ScientificTM
NalgeneTM Rapid-FlowTM 90 mM Filter Unit-1000 ml. For affinity purification, 10 ml of Ni

Sepharose excel resin (Cytiva life sciences, USA) was added for every 1 L of culture (preTFF volume) and incubated overnight, gently stirring at 4°C. Stirring was stopped to allow
the resin to settle for 1 hour, and then the supernatant was decanted, the remaining resin
and media were mixed well and poured into a gravity flow column (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). The column was treated with 3 column volumes (CVs) of wash buffer (40 mM TRISHCl pH 8 with 1M sodium chloride), 3 CV of wash buffer with 20 mM imidazole added, 3
CV of wash buffer with 40 mM imidazole, and finally 3 CV of wash buffer with 60 mM
imidazole before protein elution with 3 CV of wash buffer with 500 mM imidazole. SEctodomain-GFP protein was concentrated with an Amicon® Ultra 15 Centrifugal Filter
(100 kDa MWCO). It was injected onto a HiLoadTM 16/600 SuperdexTM 200 prep grade
FPLC size-exclusion column using 1x PBS (Fisher scientific, MA, USA) as a running
buffer. The peaks were collected with 1 mL fractions. Pure fractions were identified by
SDS-PAGE (MW ~250 kDa), pooled, and concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based hACE2 binding assay
The recombinant hACE2-AviTag protein (Acro Biosystems, DE, USA) was captured on a
sensor chip in the test flow channels. Samples of 300 μl of freshly prepared serial dilutions
of the purified recombinant protein were injected at a flow rate of 50 μl/min (contact
duration 180 seconds) for the association. Responses from the protein surface were
corrected for the response from a mock surface and for responses from a buffer-only
injection. Total hACE2 binding and data analysis were calculated with Bio-Rad ProteOn
Manager software (version 3.1).

Luminex serological assay
This assay was performed using the purified SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain (5 µg) coupled
to the surface of group A, region 43, MagPlex® Microspheres (Luminex Corp, IL, USA).
Microsphere coupling was performed using the Luminex xMAP Antibody Coupling Kit
(Luminex Corp, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The proteincoupled microspheres were re-suspended in PBS-TBN buffer (1X PBS containing 0.1%
Tween 20, 0.5% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide) at a final stock concentration of 2X106
microspheres per ml, with 2.5X103 microspheres used per reaction. The serum samples
were obtained from de-identified COVID-19 patients (n=6) and healthy donors (n=6) at
UNMC. Fifty microliters of each serum sample (diluted 1:25 with 1X PBS-TBN buffer) was
mixed with 50 µl of the S-Ectodomain coupled microspheres in a 96 well-plate (Greiner
Bio-One). The assay plate was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with shaking at 700 RPM
and then washed 5 times with 1X PBS-TBN buffer. Then, the plate was incubated with
biotin conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Abcam, MA, USA), labeled with streptavidin Rphycoerythrin reporter (Luminex xTAG® SA-PE G75) for 1 h at 25°C with shaking at
700RPM. Then, the plate was washed 5 times with 1X PBS-TBN buffer. Finally, the plate
was re-suspended in 100 µl of 1X PBS-TBN buffer and incubated for 10 minutes at 25°C
with shaking at 700 RPM. The microplate was assayed on a Luminex MAGPIXTM System,
and results were reported as median fluorescent intensity (MFI).

Bromelain treatment
VeroE6 cells were grown in 10% FBS containing media and treated with bromelain
(Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) at different concentrations (19, 37, and 75 µg/ml) for 48 h. For
the time-dependent study, the aforementioned cells were treated with bromelain (75
µg/ml) in a serum-free condition for 0-4 h. After the end of the treatment, the cells were
washed and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) containing protease
inhibitors (Roche, MA, USA). SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain expressing Tni cell media were
treated with different concentrations of bromelain (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 μg) for 1 mg of
total protein at 37°C for 1h. Recombinant TMPRSS2 (Abnova, CA, USA) was treated with
bromelain (1:1 ratio) at 37°C for different time points (30, 60, 120, and 240 mins). For the
time-dependent study, Tni media were treated with 25 μg of bromelain/mg of total protein
at 37oC for different time points (30, 60, 120, and 240 mins). For bromelain heat
inactivation assay, bromelain was heated at 80oC for 8 min and then treated with SEctodomain expressing Tni cell supernatant (25 μg of bromelain/mg of total protein) at
37°C for 30 min. For cysteine protease inhibitor (E64) treatment assay, bromelain plus E64 (1, 2, and 4 µM) was used to incubate with S-Ectodomain expressing Tni cells
supernatant (25 μg of bromelain/mg of total protein) at 37°C for 30 min. For treatment with
VeroE6 cells, bromelain (75 µg/ml) plus E-64 (4µM) was incubated with VeroE6 cells at
37°C for 2 h. At the end of the reaction, 4X laemmli buffer was added in the mixture and
boiled at 100°C for 5 min. The protein concentration in the cell lysate and media was
measured by BCA kit (ThermoFisher, MA, USA)as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
Equal concentrations of media were mixed with 4X loading buffer (Invitrogen, MA, USA)
and boiled at 100°C for 5 min. The SDS-PAGE was performed in 4-20% gradient gel (BioRad, CA, USA). We used SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen, MA, USA) to visualize the
protein band in SDS-PAGE gel. The gel image was captured using the ChemiDoc
Imaging System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). For western blot, equal concentrations of cell lysate
and media proteins were transfer into 0.45 μm PVDF membrane (Millipore, MA, USA).
Further, blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder at room temperature for 1 h, the
membrane was incubated with the target primary antibody with desired dilution (anti-ACE2, 1:1000 (Cell signaling technology, MA, USA); TMPRSS2, 1:1000 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, TX, USA); anti-SARS Spike protein 0.05 μg/ml, (Novus Biologicals, CO,
USA) at 4°C for overnight. For loading, control membranes were probed with anti-b-actin
and anti-GAPDH antibodies (1:5000, Cell signaling technology, MA, USA). The
membrane was washed with 1X TBST (3 X 5 min) and then incubated with respective
secondary antibodies (Horse anti-mice 1:2000; Horse anti-rabbit 1:2000, (Cell signaling
technology, MA, USA) and developed by using ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Bio-Rad,
CA, USA).

Deglycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain
Removal of N-glycans, O-glycans, and Sialic acids from the purified S-Ectodomain was
performed by using a Deglycosylation kit (Agilent, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer
instructions. Briefly, 1 µg of S-Ectodomain was used for N-glycanase, O-glycanase, and

Sialidase A (1µl/reaction) treatment at 37°C for 3 h. After treatment, the protein-enzyme
mixtures were mixed with 2x Laemmli buffer and boiled for 100°C for 5 min and then
immunoprobed with anti-Spike protein-specific antibody as described above.

Spike protein binding assay
Confocal microscopy: VeroE6 (1 X 105 / well) cells were seeded on coverslips in a 12 well
plate. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 75 μg/ml of bromelain and mock (1XPBS) for
1 h in serum-free media. Next, the cells were washed with 1X PBS two times and
incubated with SARS-CoV-2 S-Ectodomain-GFP (1 µg) in a serum-free media for 2 h.
Cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The Spike protein
binding was analyzed by using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal laser scanning microscope
(UNMC Core facility). Incubation of cells with GFP-His tag protein (Sino Biological, PA,
USA) served as a negative control.
Flow cytometry: VeroE6 cells were treated with 75 μg/ml of bromelain and mock (1XPBS)
for 1 h in serum-free media. Next, the cells were detached by using 2mM EDTA in PBS
and washed twice with 1X PBS. 1 X 106 cells were incubated with S-Ectodomain-GFP (1
µg) in a serum-free media for 2 h. The cells were washed and resuspended in HBSS
media for flow cytometry analysis at the UNMC core facility (BD LSR II flow cytometer).
The results were analyzed by FlowJo software.

SARS-CoV-2 infection assay
VeroE6 (1x104 cells) were seeded in 96 well plate. After 24 h, cells were washed and
treated with bromelain in a serum-free medium (n=6). The incubation of cells with PBS
served as a negative control (n=6). After 2 h of treatment, cells were washed and replaced
with serum-free media for infection with SARS-CoV-2 (strain: BEI_USA-WA1/2020)
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 for 1 h at 37°C. After infection, cells were washed
and replaced with 5% FBS containing media. After 24 h post-infection, cells were fixed
with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min at room
temperature. The fixed cells were washed with PBS then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton
X100 PBS solution for 15 min then blocked in 3% BSA PBS solution. The cells were
incubated with anti-S protein Rab (Sino Biological, PA, USA) at 1:1000 in the blocking
solution overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with 1:2000 diluted Alexa Fluor 488
conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.
The cells were counterstained for nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher, MA, USA).
The fluorescent images were captured by using a Nikon Eclipse Ts2R fluorescent
microscope. Total and virus-infected cells were counted by using Nikon NIS-Elements D
software.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 8 using a two-tailed
unpaired t-test. Statistical significance was determined at P <0.05.
