Abstract:
Effective therapies for COVID-19 are urgently needed. Presently there are more than 800
COVID-19 clinical trials globally, many with drug combinations, resulting in an empirical process
with an enormous number of possible combinations. To identify the most promising potential
therapies, we developed a biophysical model for the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and performed a
sensitivity analysis for individual model parameters and all possible pairwise parameter changes
(162 = 256 possibilities). We found that model-predicted virion production is fairly insensitive to
changes in most viral entry, assembly, and release parameters, but highly sensitive to some
viral transcription and translation parameters. Furthermore, we found a cooperative benefit to
pairwise targeting of transcription and translation, predicting that combined targeting of these
processes will be especially effective in inhibiting viral production.

Main Text:
The ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 4 million confirmed cases and 300,000 deaths
worldwide (1). The most common symptoms of the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19,
include fever, cough and fatigue (2). The clinical presentation can range from asymptomatic to
fatal, with severe cases rapidly progressing to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), and organ failure (3). There is currently no vaccine for the disease, and development
could take 12 to 18 months (4). Therefore, there exists a critical need for effective therapeutic
interventions to minimize the transmission and severity of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite increased expenditures on research and development, less than one out of every ten
therapeutic drugs that enter phase I clinical trials eventually gains FDA approval (5). To
accelerate the development process for COVID-19, the initial focus has been on repurposing
approved drugs and biologics. However, owing to the large number of possible therapeutics,
and the need for rapid testing, there has not been extensive preclinical testing on SARS-CoV-2
specifically. While these therapeutics have been deployed in combinations of two, three, or four
in more than 800 clinical trials globally (6), it is not clear which drugs, possibly in combination
with others, would, in principle, be most effective. For other RNA viruses, such as HIV, single
therapies have not been successful as a result of the virus’ ability to rapidly evolve and develop
resistance to antivirals (7), thus driving the need for combination therapies (8). With more than
100 distinct agents currently in trials to treat COVID-19, even a two drug combination has over

10,000 possible combinations that could be tried, raising the question of how to rationally focus
clinical trials on the single agents and combinations that are most likely to be effective.
Biophysical modeling has the potential to help rationally guide the development of therapeutic
interventions for SARS-CoV-2 by identifying key model parameters for effective targeting. In
addition, modeling can potentially be used to identify combination therapies, predict clinical trial
outcomes, stratify patients, and identify potential source(s) of variable patient-to-patient
outcomes. Here we present a biophysical model for the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and identify the
single and combination parameters with the highest sensitivity, representing the ideal targets for
therapeutic intervention to inhibit virus production.

The biophysical model of the SARS-CoV-2 viral life cycle was constructed based on SARS-CoV
literature that included processes underlying viral entry, genome transcription, genome
translation, virion assembly, and virion release (Fig. 1; reviewed in (9, 10)). Mass action and
chemical rate equations were used to mathematically describe the system using an approach
similar to that taken previously to model the life cycle of other viral systems (reviewed in (11);
see Materials and Methods), and the resulting series of ordinary differential equations solved
numerically. As an initial condition we assumed that a single virion was bound to the surface of
an individual cell, which was then internalized to initiate the replication cycle. As data specific to
the viral cycle to SARS-CoV-2 are limited, we primarily used experimental observations from
SARS-CoV to inform model assumptions and parameterization (Table 1). We assume that it is
reasonable to use SARS-CoV data based on the high degree of genomic similarity between the
two viruses (12–14). Using the base parameter values, the model reproduces viral production
on a timescale and of a quantity consistent with experimental observations (Fig. 2). Importantly,
the model reproduces a number of experimental observations without parameter adjustment
(Fig. 2B); for example, the model naturally predicts that ~10% of the RNA will be negative sense
(Fig. 2). Based on this, we conclude that the model provides a suitable tool to identify points of
interest for therapeutic intervention, i.e. those parameters and the associated subprocesses that
are particularly sensitive to perturbation.
To assess these points of interest in the viral cycle, we performed a sensitivity analysis for each
parameter by systematically increasing and decreasing their values from baseline by up to three
orders of magnitude (1000-fold) while holding all other parameters constant (Fig. 3).
Parameters specific to virion stoichiometry or RNA segment length were ignored in this analysis

as they are likely difficult to target clinically. Using the viral cycle time tcycle, defined as the time
to produce 1000 virions, as a readout of viral replication rate, we examined viral production as a
function of individual parameter values. We found that parameter perturbation resulted in a
variety of responses, ranging from insensitive to highly sensitive (Fig. 3A-C). As seen in Figure
3D, viral production was most sensitive to perturbation of many, but not all, parameters related
to genome transcription and translation. While two parameters specific to viral packaging were
able to eliminate viral production, the majority of parameters related to viral entry, packaging,
and release were comparably insensitive to changes from the base values (Fig. 3D). While it is
theoretically possible to inhibit viral production via targeting of the insensitive parameters, it is
necessary to achieve a high level of inhibition compared to those that exhibit high sensitivity
(Fig. S1). For example, parameters specific to viral entry and packaging required 100-1000x
level of inhibition in order to influence viral production (Figs. 3D and S1A, C), while parameters
specific to replication completely inhibited viral production after only a 10x effect (Figs. 3D and
S1B). Based on these observations, we conclude that transcription and translation represent
high sensitivity targets for therapeutic inhibition.
Due to the ability to rapidly evolve, viral diseases are often treated with combination therapies.
While an exhaustive combinatorial analysis is difficult or impossible to conduct experimentally
due to time and resource limitations, it can quickly be implemented in silico. To identify potential
combinations that could cooperate to inhibit viral production in the model, we performed a
pairwise sensitivity analysis of the model parameters. Parameter pairs were either coordinately
increased or decreased from their base value and then scored based on the results (see
Materials and Methods). To score parameter combinations we defined a sensitivity (S) and
range (R) value (Fig. 4A), similar to our previous approach for another biophysical model (15).
The sensitivity S is a measure of how viral production scales with changes to the base
parameter values, while R is a measure of the magnitude of perturbation necessary to produce
a maximal effect. Ideally, interventional therapies would have a strong effect (large S) with
minimal perturbation (small R). Therefore, we scored parameter pairs by dividing the resulting S
value by the value of R (S/R). As seen in Figures 4B and S2, several parameter combinations
completely eliminated viral production with only a <10-fold effect. Similar to the single
parameter sensitivity analysis, parameters related to transcription and translation once again
emerged as the highest sensitivity targets; the highest scores were parameter combinations
specific to the host ribosomes and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). One
other noteworthy pair that completely eliminated viral production was the half-life of the

structural proteins (hSP), which comprise the mature virion, and the rate at which those proteins
are translocated from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum (kCyto-ER). While the majority of
high scoring combinations were simply the result of pairing with an already high sensitivity
%&'
parameter (𝑘!"#$
), several combinations resulted in cooperating effects between the two

parameters (Fig. 4C). As seen in Figure 4C, the greatest amount of cooperativity occurred
when combining parameters specific to transcription and translation together. Based on these
results, we conclude combination targeting of transcription and translation can lead to enhanced
effects on viral production, beyond targeting each individually.
Overall, our modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, parameterized using published SARS-CoV
literature, shows that theoretically there are opportunities for therapeutic interventions that
significantly inhibit the viral cycle. In particular, the sensitivity analysis identified several
parameters in the middle of the viral cycle, specific to genome transcription and translation, that
present the best opportunities for inhibiting viral production. By comparison, parameters specific
to viral entry, virion assembly, and virion release were less sensitive and therefore are less
promising as targets for inhibiting viral production. The model further identifies potential
combination targets that would cooperatively inhibit viral production. For example, the
%&'
combined effects of targeting both the stepping rate of the host ribosome, 𝑘!"#$
, and the binding
%*%$
rate of RdRp, 𝑘()
, may halt the viral cycle even with modest 10X effects. Such a pairwise

analysis would be difficult to exhaustively test experimentally, especially in the clinic, since there
are 162 = 256 possible combinations.
In addition to identifying novel target opportunities within the viral cycle, biophysical modeling
may also provide insight into current and emerging therapeutic approaches. Several existing
antiviral drugs are being evaluated for their efficacy in treating COVID-19 (16). It is interesting
to note that remdesivir, which was recently approved for emergency use in the U.S. and Japan,
acts to disrupt genome transcription by interfering with the viral RdRp (17, 18), and thus is one
example of a therapeutic intervention that interferes with an area of high sensitivity identified by
the model. By contrast, hydroxychloroquine, which inhibits viral entry by increasing endosomal
pH and affecting terminal glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor (19), is predicted by the model to
be less likely to be effective since drugs that act on viral entry would require exceptionally high
suppression to achieve appreciable effects on viral production. Viral entry inhibitors have been
used to treat HIV (20) and influenza (21), therefore it may yet be feasible to target viral entry.

Additionally, we note that therapeutics predicted to be less effective in the viral cycle model,
may have potent effects elsewhere in disease progression, e.g. in the immune response. Thus,
ineffectiveness in inhibiting viral production does not preclude therapeutic effectiveness overall.
Finally, the recent host-virus protein interaction map reported by Gordon et al. (22) identified two
classes of SARS-CoV-2 targeting opportunities: 1) inhibitors of protein translation and 2)
regulators of Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors. Based on our modeling, we predict that therapeutic
targeting of the Sigma1 and 2 receptors is not likely to be effective as it would presumably
interfere with the virion assembly and release steps, which are relatively insensitive (Fig. 3D).
By contrast, we predict that targeting protein translation is more likely to be effective due to the
high sensitivity of viral cycle time to translation-associated parameters (Fig. 3D). Everything
else being equal, the model predicts that transcription inhibition combined with translation
inhibition would be an especially effective combination (Fig. 4B-C). Altogether, our model
provides a framework for understanding viral cycle dynamics and identifying the therapeutic
opportunities that are most likely to be effective in inhibiting viral production.

Materials and Methods:
The system of ODEs describing the viral cycle was solved using the ode15s solver in Matlab
(R2019a; The Mathworks, Natick, MA).

Viral entry
Upon initialization the model is assumed to have a single viral particle (SARS-CoV-2) bound to
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane (SCoV2-ACE2). SARS-CoV-2
is internalized into endosomes as the spike protein is cleaved by transmembrane protease,
serine 2 (TMPRSS2) at a first order-rate (kTMP).

(Eq. 1)

This reaction and other proteolytic reactions in the model are simplified to the product of a firstorder rate constant 𝑘 and the concentration of the enzyme ([E]) where k = (kcat/KM)[E]SS. This
assumption is true when the substrate concentration is much less than the Michaelis-Menten
constant value, [S] << KM . For each reaction we assumed a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) equal to
150,000 M-1s-1, the median value for a range of enzymes (23). The steady-state concentration of
the enzyme, [E]SS, was estimated using the baseline parameter values in Table 1. Endosomal
SARS-CoV-2 is then released and the genomic RNA uncoated with the first-order rates kRel and
kUC, respectively.

Transcription and translation
After the full-length genomic RNA (gRNA) is released and uncoated, host ribosomes bind to
open reading frames to begin translation of pp1a and pp1ab. In each instance, transcription
and translation is modeled as a multistep process (Figure 1 of the main text; inset), similar to
that outlined in (24).
i.

Initial binding of the enzyme (Ribosome or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) to its
respective substrate (RNA) is assumed to be irreversible and is the product of the
second-order association rate (kon) and the concentrations of the enzyme and its
substrate.

ii.

The enzyme completes the primer sequence at rate kPrime, which is determined by the
stepping rate of the respective enzyme (kStep) and the length of the primer sequence (l);
kPrime = kStep/l. This first step is fast (~0.5-1 s), and once completed the substrate is
released such that multiple enzymes can bind to a single strand of RNA. The actively
polymerizing translation or transcription complex (T-SE) then continues through the
elongation process.

iii.

For each active T-SE, the rate of termination (kTerm) is proportional to the length (l) of the
sequence and the stepping rate; kTerm = kStep/l. Upon termination, the enzyme unbinds
from the substrate and the product is released.

For the specific example of translating pp1a/1ab by the host ribosomes, this multistep process
results in the following equations

The final multistep process is the translation of sgRNA by host ribosomes to produce the
structural proteins making up the mature virion, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid protein (N). Additionally, sgRNA is degraded with the same half-life as gRNA
(hgRNA).

In the above equations, 𝜆 is the ratio of producing S, E, or M proteins relative to N protein. The
value of l is determined by the stoichiometries of each. Furthermore, the translation rate of S,
E, or M protein is assumed to be proportional to the final stoichiometry in the mature virion, and
therefore they can be lumped together, simplifying the handling equations.

Virion assembly and release
S, E, and M proteins are polymerized in the cytoplasm but are then translocated through the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC) at first-order rates
kCyt-ER and kER-ERGIC, respectively.

Sensitivity analysis
To initially assess model sensitivity, we used the viral cycle time tcycle, defined as the time to
produce 1000 virions, as a measure of viral production; the longer the cycle time, the lower the
viral production. For single parameter changes (Figure 3 in the main text), individual
parameters were adjusted via multiplication by a scaling constant (c), which was assigned
values between 0.001 and 1000 on a logarithmic scale.
𝑝 = 𝑐𝑝O

(Eq. 31)

where p0 is the baseline value of the specific parameter.
Pairwise sensitivity analysis was performed using a similar approach to that described in (15),
where a sensitivity (S) and range (R) value were assigned based on how model output scales
with changes in parameter values. To perform the pairwise analysis, we defined viral
production level by
"+,+34,6

𝑣$ =

"+,+34,78

(Eq. 32)

where tcycle,0 is the baseline cycle time and tcycle,ij is the cycle time resulting after perturbation of
the paired parameters. Parameter combinations were scaled using a constant (c), which was
assigned values between 0.1 and 1 on a logarithmic scale. Both parameters were scaled down
by multiplication with the constant
𝑝& = 𝑐𝑝&,O

(Eq. 33)

𝑝P = 𝑐𝑝P,O

(Eq. 34)

or scaled up by dividing by the same constant value.

A sensitivity value was assigned by measuring the change in viral production as a function of
the change in the parameter values.

Thus, S is the slope of the plot of vp versus log(c) (Figure 5A in the main text). Assigning values
using Eqs. S30 and S35 resulted in positive values for parameters that inhibited viral production,
increasing cycle time, and negative values for parameter changes that promoted viral
production, decreasing cycle time. The R values were defined as the scale value between the
maximum and minimum viral production level.

A minimum of a 10% change in viral production was required to assign a value, such that if vp,max

Doing so assured higher scores were assigned to those combinations exhibiting high sensitivity
over a small range of values, the ideal characteristic for targets of therapeutic intervention.
Individually, some parameters are insensitive while others are highly sensitive (Figure 3A-C in
the main text). Therefore, we sought to assess whether high-scoring pairwise combinations
were simply the combined effects of two sensitive parameters or if there was some amount of
cooperativity occurring when both were targeted. We approximated parameter cooperativity as
the difference between the pairwise score and the sum of the individual scores according to
𝐶 = [𝑆⁄𝑅]&P − C[𝑆⁄𝑅]& + [𝑆⁄𝑅]P D

(Eq. 40)

Thus, cooperative pairs will have a positive value according to Eq. 40, while those that are anticooperative will have a negative value.

Modeling small molecule inhibitors
To simulate the effects of a small molecule inhibitor on individual parameters we scaled
individual parameters (p) according to a Hill-function
$ [W]

𝑝 = 𝑝O − X 6Y[W]
B

(Eq. 41)

where p0 is the baseline value, [D]is the concentration of the theoretical small molecule inhibitor,
and KD is the dissociation constant, or the affinity, of the inhibitor for its target parameter.
Simulated values for KD are indicated in Figure 4 of the main text. Inhibitor concentrations were
varied between 0.01 and 100 μM on a logarithmic scale. For each case, viral production was
estimated according to Eq. 32 above. Levels of inhibition at each concentration come from the
Hill-function in Eq. 41 and are equal to p/p0 for a given inhibitor concentration and KD value.

Figure 1 - Model for the viral cycle of SARS-CoV-2. A single SARS-CoV-2 virion bound to
the membrane of a target cell is internalized via TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of the spike
protein (1) followed by endosomal release (2) and uncoating (3) of the viral genome. Once the
full-length genome is internalized, host ribosomes bind to open reading frames to translate the
polypeptides pp1a and pp1ab (4). Part of pp1a/1ab encodes the main protease (Mpro) involved
in cleaving the polypeptides into the non-structural proteins that make up the replicasetranscriptase complex involved in replicating the virus, including the RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) (5). (6) The RdRp first creates negative-sense RNA (nRNA) templates from
the positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA), which are then used to replicate the full-length gRNA
as well as sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgRNA) (7) encoding the structural proteins
necessary to build the mature virion. (8) sgRNA is translated by the host ribosomes to make the
structural spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. (9) Multiple N
proteins bind to the gRNA to package the nucleocapsids. (10) While initially translated in the
cytoplasm, S, E, and M proteins are translocated through the endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) and
ER-Golgi intermediate complex (ERGIC), where buds from the ERGIC eventually encapsulate
nucleocapsids to form the mature virion (11). (12) Mature virions are then released into the
surrounding tissue through exocytosis. Inset: detailed diagram of steps in transcription and
translation. (i) Initially the RdRp or ribosome (enzyme) binds to the primer region of the
respective RNA segment (substrate). (ii) Once the primer segment is completed, the substrate
is released such that it is available for binding to the primer region by another enzyme.
Meanwhile, the initial enzyme continues with elongation steps, polymerizing the reaction
product. (iii) Upon complete polymerization of the product (RNA segment or protein),
transcription/translation is terminated, and the enzyme and resulting product are released.

Figure 4 - Pairwise sensitivity analysis reveals combinations of high interest. A) Example
output used to score sensitivity (S) and range (R) is shown. S is estimated as the slope of the
normalized viral production (p) versus the logarithm of the scaling parameter (c). As a result of
the analysis approach, viral inhibition (as shown here) results in a positive slope, or S value,
while promotion of viral production results in a negative S value. R is the difference between the
scaling parameter values where maximum and minimum viral production occur. B) Pairwise
scoring of sensitivity and range (S/R). Gray boxes indicate the diagonal where only a single
parameter is scaled. Relative to the diagonal, the upper-right region is where both parameter
values were increased, while the lower-left region is where both parameter values were
decreased. Bold boxes indicate parameter combinations that eliminated viral production (pmin =
0). C) Cooperative parameter effects are estimated by the difference between the combined
effect ([S/R]ij) and the sum of the individual effects ([S/R]i + [S/R]j). Since increasing parameter
values (upper-right) did not result in viral inhibition (B), this region was omitted. Positive values
(red) resulted when the combined effect was stronger than the sum of the individual effects.
Negative values (blue) resulted when the combined effect was weaker than the individual
effects. Gray and bold boxes are the same as in B.
