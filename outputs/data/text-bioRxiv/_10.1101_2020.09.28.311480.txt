ABSTRACT

31

COVID-19 vaccines are being developed urgently worldwide, among which

32

single-shot adenovirus vectored vaccines represent a major approach. Here, we

33

constructed two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidates on simian

34

adenovirus serotype 23 (Sad23L) and human adenovirus serotype 49 vectors (Ad49L)

35

carrying the full-length gene of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), designated

36

Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively. The immunogenicity

37

elicited by these two vaccine strains was individually evaluated in mice. Specific

38

humoral and cellular immune responses were proportionally observed in a

39

dose-dependent manner, and stronger response was obtained by boosting.

40

Furthermore, five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected with a dose of

41

5×109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine for prime vaccination, followed by boosting

42

with 5×109 PFU of Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine at 4-week interval. Three macaques were

43

injected with Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP vectorial viruses as negative controls.

44

Both mice and macaques tolerated well the vaccine inoculations without detectable

45

clinical or pathologic changes. In macaques, prime-boost vaccination regimen

46

induced high titers of 103.16 S-binding antibody (S-BAb), 102.75 cell receptor binding

47

domain (RBD)-BAb and 102.38 neutralizing antibody (NAb) to pseudovirus a week

48

after boosting injection, followed by sustained high levels over 10 weeks of

49

observation. Robust IFN-γ secreting T-cell response (712.6 SFCs/106 cells), IL-2

50

secreting T-cell response (334 SFCs/106 cells) and intracellular IFN-γ expressing

animals in preparation of clinical phase 1/2 trials.

INTRODUCTION

60

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) usually presents as severe acute

61

respiratory syndrome triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection (1, 2), which has become

62

globally pandemic and killed nearly one million people worldwide (WHO

63

Coronavirus Disease [COVID-19] Dashboard) (3). Currently the most urgent need is

64

to develop safe and effective vaccines that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.

65

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, encoding four

66

structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and

67

nucleocapsid (N) (4, 5). The S protein is a glycoprotein carrying the cell receptor

68

binding domain (RBD), and is a major protective antigen that may elicit potent

69

neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cellular immunity (4, 5). Therefore, S protein has

70

been the primary target antigen for developing recombinant vaccines.

71

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report for a draft landscape

72

of COVID-19 candidate vaccines on August 28, 2020, there are 33 vaccine candidates

73

in clinical evaluation, which are mainly distributed across five types of

74

biotechnological platforms, i.e., inactivated virus, DNA, RNA, protein subunit and

75

non-replicating viral vector vaccines (6). Among COVID-19 candidate vaccines in

76

clinical trials, five non-replicating adenovirus vectored vaccines progressed to the

77

frontline, of which one (CanSino Biological Inc./Beijing Institute of Biotechnology)

78

has been approved for emerging use in Chinese military personal, one (Gamaleya

79

Research Institute) has been registered in Russia, and two have been in initial phase

80

III clinical trial (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca; Janssen Pharmaceutical

81

Companies), and one in phase I clinical trial (ReiThera/LEUKOCARE/Univercells),

82

respectively. Recombinant adenovirus vectors originated from various serotype of

83

strains have displayed good safety profiles and induced broad and strong humoral and

84

cellular immune responses, which have been widely used for research and

85

development of vaccines (7). Based on the published data regarding human

86

adenovirus type 5 (Ad5), chimpanzee adenovirus type 25Y (ChAdOx1) and human

87

adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vectorial COVID-19 vaccines (8-14), results showed that a

88

single-shot vaccine prevented SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in rhesus macaques and

89

hamsters, and elicited significant immune response in the majority of recipients in

90

phase I/II clinical trials. However, relatively weaker protection in animals and lower

91

immune response in humans were observed with a single dose of vaccine compared

92

with prime-boost immunizations by two or three doses of inactivated virus or mRNA

93

vaccines (15-19). Enhancement of immune response was evidenced by prime and

94

boost vaccination regimens with homologous boosting of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in

95

animals and humans (11,20), or with heterologous Ad26 and Ad5 vectored

96

COVID-19 vaccines in humans (21).

97

In this study, two novel simian adenovirus type 23 (SAdV23) and human

98

adenovirus type 49 (HAdV49) derived vectors (Sad23L and Ad49L) were used for

99

developing the COVID-19 vaccines carrying the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2

100

(22, 23) designated Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines, respectively.

101

These two adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines presented high infectious titers

102

and low frequencies of pre-existing immunity in humans. Immunogenicity was

103

extensively evaluated in mice and rhesus macaques by prime-boost vaccinations with

104

these two novel heterologous adenovirus vectored vaccines.

145

Vaccination (n=5) and sham control (n=3) groups of rhesus macaques (Table S1)

146

were first injected with 5×109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine or Sad23L-GFP control,

147

and then at 4 week interval, animals were injected with a second dose of 5×109 PFU

148

Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine or Ad49L-GFP control, respectively. During the course of

149

immunization, clinical parameters were monitored for eight weeks. All monkeys

150

displayed normal appetite and mental state, and no obvious change of weight and

151

body temperature was observed with these eight animals (Fig. 2B). Hematological

152

and biochemical examination of blood samples showed no notable variation when

quantified by ELISA in a dose-dependent manner with both Sad23L-nCoV-S and

165

Ad49L-nCoV-S immunized mice, but not in the control groups (P<0.001, Fig. 3,

166

A-D). A dose of 109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced antibody titers of 104.27

167

S-BAb and 103.98 RBD-BAb (Fig. 3, A and B), while the same dose of

168

Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine induced titers of 103.02 S-BAb and 102.42 RBD-BAb,

169

respectively (Fig. 3, C and D).

170

The neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers to SARS-CoV-2 were titrated in two

171

individual vaccine immunized mice by surrogate virus based NAb test (sVNT) and

172

pseudovirus-based NAb test (pVNT) at 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50), respectively

173

(Fig. 3, E-H). A dose of 109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced NAb titers of

174

102.41 sVNT(ID50) and 102.79 pVNT (ID50) (Fig. 3, E and F), and Ad49L-nCoV-S

175

vaccine induced titers of 101.38 sVNT (ID50) and 101.57 pVNT(ID50), respectively (Fig.

176

3, G and H).

177

Specific T-cell response of isolated splenocytes was examined in vaccinated and

178

sham mice after stimulation with S peptides, S protein and RBD protein, respectively

179

(Fig. 3, I-N; Fig. S3). A single dose of Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine elicited strong

180

specific IFN-γ secreting T cell response to S peptides (450.2-898.4 SFCs/million cells,

181

Fig. 3I) and S protein (81.5-246.8 SFCs/million cells, Fig. 3J), while a dose of

182

Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine induced similar pattern of IFN-γ secreting T cell response

183

(336.8-857.1 or 82.8-232 SFCs/million cells, Fig. 3, K and L). Both vaccines elicited

184

T cell response significantly higher than sham controls (P<0.001), but response to

185

RBD protein was not significantly different (P>0.05, Fig. S3, A and B). Specific

186

intracellular levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 expressing CD4+ or CD8+ T cell

187

response to S peptides were measured by ICS, in which significantly higher frequency

188

of IFN-γ and TNF-α but not IL-2 expressing CD4+/CD8+ T-cells was found in both

189

Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccinated mice compared to sham mice

190

(P<0.001, Fig. 3, M and N; Fig. S3, C-F).

191

Overall, individual Sad23L-nCoV-S or Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccinated mice

192

developed specific BAb and NAb antibodies and T cell responses to S protein, RBD

193

protein or S peptides of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3),

194

suggesting strong immunogenicity of the two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19

vaccines.

To further improve reactivity and longevity of immune response to vaccines, the

200

prime-boost vaccination regimen was utilized to immunize C57BL/6 and BALB/c

201

mice (n=5/group) with a prime dose of 109 PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S on day 0 and a

202

boost dose of 109 PFU Ad49L-nCoV-S on day 28 (Fig. 4A). In comparison with

203

prime immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S, a booster with Ad49L-nCoV-S

204

significantly increased BAb and NAb titers in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (P<0.001;

205

Fig. 4, B-G), and titers were maintained at high level for 10 weeks of monitoring (Fig.

4, D and G). Profiling of IgG subclasses showed a predominant serum IgG2a to RBD

207

protein associating with Th1 response in prime-boost vaccinated mice (Fig. S4).

208

Regarding specific T cell response, the boosting with Ad49L-sCoV-S on

209

Sad23L-nCoV-S prime immunization enhanced or stabilized specific IFN-γ-secretion

210

T cell responses to S peptides, S protein or RBD protein (Fig. 4H), as well as levels of

211

intracellular cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α but not of IL-2 response to S peptides

212

compared with single dose of vaccine vaccinated or sham control C57BL/6 and

213

BALB/c mice (Fig. 4I; Fig. S5).

214

Taken together, the results suggest that prime-boost vaccination of two species of

215

mice with Sad23L-nCoV-S followed by Ad49L-nCoV-S enhanced specific immune

216

response to SARS-CoV-2 when compared with prime vaccination only with a

Eight rhesus macaques aged 11-14 years were selected and tested for the baseline

222

values of antibody and T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 S from blood samples in

223

pre-vaccination at week -1 or week 0 (Fig. 5A; Table S1). The pre-existing NAb titer

224

to Sad23L, Ad49L or Ad5 was detected < 1:10 in serum samples from all eight

225

animals (Table. S1).

226

Five rhesus macaques were intramuscularly injected first with a dose of 5×109

227

PFU Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine, then with a boost injection of 5×109 PFU

228

Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine 4 weeks later, while three sham rhesus macaques controls

229

were injected with equal doses of Sad23L-GFP and Ad49L-GFP viruses, respectively

230

(Fig. 5A). Blood samples were collected weekly from these two groups of animals.

231

Both BAb (S-BAb and RBD-BAb) and NAb (sVNT and pVNT) levels were titrated

232

in the vaccinated group but not in sham group. BAb and NAb reactivity increased at

233

week 2 post prime-immunization, at week 4 (W0 for boost-immunization), at weeks 5

234

and 6 and then stayed at high levels up to week 10 (Fig. 5, B-E). Titers of 103.16

235

S-BAb (Fig. 5B), 102.75 RBD-BAb (Fig. 5C), 10 2.01 sVNT(ID50) (Fig. 5D) and 102.38

236

pVNT(ID50) (Fig. 5E) were quantified and found higher than the corresponding

237

antibody titers found in sera from 25 asymptomatic, 14 mild and 9 severe COVID-19

238

convalescent patients (Fig. 5, B-E). Strong correlation between BAb and NAb titers

239

was observed (P<0.0001, R=0.784-0.927; Fig. 5, F and G), suggesting the reliability

240

of these antibody quantitative assays.

241

PBMCs were isolated from whole blood of pre- and post-immunized monkeys

242

for evaluation of T cell responses to S peptides, S and RBD protein by ELISpot and

243

ICS (Fig. 6). Prime vaccination with a dose of Sad23L-nCoV-S vaccine induced an

244

increase of IFN-γ secreting T cell response to S peptides (406.6-526.3 SFCs/million

245

cells) at weeks 2 and 4 post prime-vaccination, and then boosting with a dose of

246

248

RBD proteins stayed at high levels after prime-boost immunizations (Fig. 6, B and C).

249

Relatively high IL-2 secreting T cell response to S peptides, S and RBD proteins was

250

observed (Fig. 6, D-F), but weak IL-4 secreting T cell response by ELISpot (Fig. S6).

Frequency of intracellular IFN-γ expressing CD4+/CD8+ T-cell responses to S

significantly higher than observed in pre-vaccination and sham controls (P<0.01).

254

Frequency of intracellular TNF-α expressing CD4+ T cell response was also found

255

significantly different between vaccinated and sham monkeys (P<0.05; Fig. S7, A and

was not statistically different between groups (P>0.05; Fig. S7, C-F).

In summary, prime-boost vaccination with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S

259

vaccines at an interval of 4 weeks elicited higher levels of specific antibody and T-cell

DISCUSSION

284
285

A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine is one of the most wanted goods in the world.

286

Among 33 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical trials (WHO report on 28 August

287

2020) (6), 9 vaccines have initiated clinical phase III trial, and experimental data from

288

pre-clinical and/or clinical studies have been published (8-21). In the frontline of

289

COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical trial phase III, the range of approaches

290

includes three inactivated virus, two lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA

291

and four non-replicating adenovirus vectored vaccines (6). Beyond general comments

292

on the disadvantages of major types of COVID-19 vaccines (24,25), the limitations of

293

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are crucial biosafety concerns regarding large

294

amounts of infectious virus being processed above biological safety level-3 (BSL-3)

295

condition and production capacity; for LNP-mRNA vaccines instability and lack of

296

evidence for efficacy are puzzling; for adenovirus vectored vaccines, pre-existing

297

immunity to the carrier virus and the relative weakness of single-shot immunization

298

appear limiting factors.

299

In this study, we generated two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines

300

encoding the full-length S gene of SARS-CoV-2. The intact S glycoprotein rather

301

than the shorter S or RBD proteins was shown to be the most effective antigen

302

eliciting protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in DNA vaccines and

303

Ad26 vectored vaccines (12,13,26). The vectors Sad23L and Ad49L originated from

304

simian adenovirus type 23 and human adenovirus type 49, respectively (22,23), are

305

novel adenoviral vector. Comparing Ad5-vectored COVID-19, ChAdox1 nCoV-19

306

and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines (8-12,14,21), three attractive aspects emphasized in this

307

study are highlighted below.

308

Firstly, there is a low-seroprevalence of pre-existing antibodies to Sad23L and

309

Ad49L vectors in humans. According to the investigation of NAb to three types of

310

adenoviruses in Chinese population, the prevalence of both Sad23L and Ad49L NAb

311

was below 10%, while the prevalence of Ad5 NAb was over 75% (Fig. 1D). However,

312

the pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity might partly limit vaccine effectiveness,

313

especially for populations aged over 50 (8,9,24,25), while the low seroprevalence of

314

antibodies to novel adenoviral vectors such as ChAdox1 (11), Ad26 (12,14,21,27),

315

and Sad23L and Ad49L used in this study might avoid a negative impact on vaccine

316

efficacy (22-24).

317

Secondly, the prime-boost vaccination regimen with two heterologous

318

adenoviruses vectored Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines examined in

319

mice and rhesus macaques suggested that the boost with Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccine

320

significantly enhanced the levels of neutralizing antibody and IFN-γ expressing

321

CD4+/CD8+ T cell responses following prime-immunization with Sad23L-nCoV-S

322

vaccine (Fig. 4-6). In addition, specific IFN-γ secretion T cell response was prolonged

323

at high level after boosting vaccination. Two recent publications compared prime only

324

with a single-dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and homologous boost with a second dose

325

of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in mice and pigs, and human clinical trials, showed

326

that boost vaccination significantly increased and prolonged the level of binding or

327

neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (11,20). By boosting with Ad5-S

328

vaccine the Ad26-S vaccine primed immunization, a higher level of immunity was

329

observed in humans as reported in a recent Russian study (21). Compared with

330

homologous boosting of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or boosting of Ad5-S vaccines (11,21),

331

heterologous prime-boost vaccinations with Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S

332

vaccines have the advantage of avoiding vector’s immunity interfering with prime

333

vaccination or enhancing pre-existing Ad5 immunity (22-25).

334

Thirdly, in order to achieve an effective vaccine immunity, a low dose of two

335

heterologous adenovirus vectored vaccines (<5×1010 vp) with prime-boost

336

immunization regimen should theoretically reduce severe adverse reaction induced by

337

a high dose of adenovirus vectored vaccine (>5×1010 vp) with prime only

338

immunization in clinical trials (8,9,11,14). In this study, a relatively low dose of

339

Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines elicited a robust immunity in both

340

young mice and older rhesus macaques (aged 11-14 years), but no obvious clinical

341

symptoms or histopathological changes were observed (Fig. 2; Fig. S1; Fig. S2).

342

There are two limitations to this work. Considering biosafety and restriction for

343

SARS-CoV-2 virus manipulation, conventional live virus neutralization test (cVNT)

344

and virus injection challenge experiments have not been performed in this study.

345

However, sVNT and pVNT reported in this study have well demonstrated a

346

significant correlation with cVNT in NAb titers to SARS-CoV-2 (P<0.0001,

347

R=0.7678-0.8591) (28). This was also evidenced by close correlation between ELISA

348

and pVNT or cVNT by other studies using adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines

349

in rhesus macaques (P<0.0001, R=0.8314-0.8427) (12), hamsters (P<0.0001;

351

addition, compared with a panel of convalescent serum samples from COVID-19

352

patients the level of binding or neutralizing antibodies observed in this study was

353

favorable and in line with all other published data from COVID-19 vaccines.

354

Protective efficacy of Sad23L-nCoV-S and Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines for prime-boost

355

vaccination of animals might be referred to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or Ad26.COV2.S

356

vaccine immunized rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge (10,12), because

357

Sad23L and ChAdOx1, Ad49L and Ad26 were classified in the same species E or D

358

of adenoviruses, respectively (7).

359

In conclusion, two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccines were

360

produced, which could, when used in succession, safely elicit robust humoral and

361

T-cell immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in mice and Rhesus macaques. Prime-boost

362

vaccination

363

Ad49L-nCoV-S vaccines were recommended to develop the better protective

364

immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in humans. These two vaccines are being planned for

Construction of two novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine strains

402

According to the description of Sad23L vector (SAdV23, GenBank: AY530877.1)

403

(22,23), the replication defective adenoviral vector Ad49L was constructed by

404

deleting the E1 and E3 regions of the full-length human adenovirus serotype 49

405

genome (HAdV49, GenBank: DQ393829.1). The E4 region open reading frame 6

406

(orf6) was replaced by the corresponding element of human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)

407

in order to improve virus propagating efficiency. The full-length S protein gene of

408

SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3) was optimized and synthesized (Beijing

409

Genomics Institute, China) and was cloned into adenoviral vectors Sad23L and

410

Ad49L, respectively. The recombinant adenoviral constructs Sad23L-nCoV-S and

411

Ad49L-nCoV-S were rescued, and the novel adenovirus vectored COVID-19 vaccine

ELISpot

509

Monkey (or mouse) IFN-gamma, IL-2 or IL-4 ELISpotPLUS kits (MabTech) were

510

used to determine SARS-CoV-2 S antigen-specific T lymphocyte response. Rhesus

511

macaque’s PBMCs (2×105 cells/well) or mouse splenocytes (5×105 cells/well) were

512

stimulated with S peptides, S or RBD protein (5μg/ml) in triplicates, respectively.

513

Seventy-nine peptides encoding for amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

514

were predicted (http://www.iedb.org/) and synthesized by Guangzhou IGE
