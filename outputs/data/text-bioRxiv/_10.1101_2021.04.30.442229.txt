Abstract

16

Background: Male sex and old age are risk factors for COVID-19 severity, but the underlying causes

17

are unknown. A possible explanation for this might be the differences in immunological profiles in

18

males and the elderly before the infection. Given the seasonal profile of COVID-19, the seasonal

19

response against SARS-CoV-2 could also be different in these groups.

20

Methods: The abundance of circulating proteins and immune populations associated with severe

21

COVID-19 was analyzed in 2 healthy cohorts. PBMCs of female, male, young, and old subjects in

22

different seasons of the year were stimulated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2.

23

Results: Several T cell subsets, which are known to be depleted in severe COVID-19 patients, were

24

intrinsically less abundant in men and older individuals. Plasma proteins increasing with disease

25

severity, including HGF, IL-8, and MCP-1, were more abundant in the elderly and males. The elderly

26

produced significantly more IL-1RA and had a dysregulated IFNγ response with lower production in

27

the summer compared with young individuals.

28

Conclusions: The immune characteristics of severe COVID-19, described by a differential abundance

29

of immune cells and circulating inflammatory proteins, are intrinsically present in healthy men and

30

the elderly. This might explain the susceptibility of men and the elderly to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

37

Having emerged in China in December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe

38

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a major health crisis. As of April

39

2021, SARS-CoV-2 has led to over 135 million infections and more than 3 million deaths worldwide

40

[1].

41

The most vulnerable groups are people older than 70 years old and adults with underlying health

42

conditions such as chronic respiratory problems and diabetes [2]. While age is the strongest

43

predictor of death from COVID-19, the sharp increase in fatality after 50 years of age is more critical

44

in men [3, 4]. Association of male sex with higher mortality has been consistently reported in

45

different populations [5-7].

46

The factors underlying the impact of age and sex on the susceptibility to severe COVID-19 are,

47

however, incompletely understood. Most studies to date have focused on the differences between

48

either young and old or men and women during the disease process. A recent study has shown that

49

male COVID-19 patients had higher circulating concentrations of cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-18, as

50

well as a greater abundance of non-classical monocytes [8]. In contrast, a higher degree of T cell

51

activation was observed in females than males during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

52

We previously analyzed 269 circulating proteins to identify COVID-19 severity markers by comparing

53

patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) to patients who do not require ICU admission [9]. Several

54

cytokines and chemokines such as IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3), and

55

growth factors, e.g., hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), were increased in ICU patients, whereas stem

56

cell factor (SCF) and several TNF-family proteins, e.g., TNF-related activation-induced cytokine

57

(TRANCE) were decreased in ICU patients. Besides, frequently reported severe COVID-19

58

characteristics include elevated TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, IP-10, and IL-10 concentrations, lower numbers

59

and activity of T, B, and NK cells, lower antigen presentation, and downregulated type I interferon

60

signaling [10-13]. Changes in cell populations and plasma proteins related to COVID-19 severity are

61

also summarized in Supp. Table 1. However, it is unknown whether such differences are induced by

62

the disease severity itself, or the potential to respond differently was already present in the healthy

63

steady-state condition.

64

In this study, we analyzed some of the immune cell populations and circulating proteins linked to

65

COVID-19 severity (Supp. Table 2) in two Dutch cohorts of healthy individuals. Our reasoning for

66

choosing these parameters is based on the type of data available from the two cohorts. We

67

investigated if healthy men and individuals over 50 years old already have an immunological profile

68

that predisposes them to severe COVID-19 progression upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the

69

pandemic’s seasonal character is not completely clear, several studies reported links to temperature

70

and humidity [14, 15]. Therefore, we also hypothesized that immunological differences induced by

71

the seasons could influence the disease outcome. Hence, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-induced

72

immune responses in healthy individuals in vitro at different time points of a year using cryo-

73

preserved PBMCs from one of the cohorts. This study provides new insights into how age, sex, and

74

seasons influence COVID-19 response (Figure 1).

MATERIALS & METHODS

77

Study Cohorts

78

534 healthy individuals of Western European origin were included in Cohort 1 (500 Functional

79

Genomics Project, see www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org) at the Radboud University Medical

80

Center between August 2013 and December 2014. 45 volunteers were initially excluded due to

81

medication use and chronic diseases, while 37 participants were later excluded from the analysis

82

because one or more measurements were unavailable. Data of 452 participants, 229 females and

83

223 males with age ranges of 18-70 and 18-75, respectively, were used for analysis.

84

324 healthy individuals of Western European origin, Cohort 2, were included from April 2017 until

85

June 2018 at the Radboud University Medical Center. 183 participants were female, and 141 were

86

male with age ranges of 18-62 and 18-71, respectively. This cohort served as a validation cohort for

87

proteomics.

88

Both studies were approved by the Arnhem-Nijmegen Medical Ethical Committee (NL42561.091.12

89

and NL58553.091.16). Inclusion and experimentation procedures were conducted according to the

90

principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers

91

before sample collection.

92

Proteomics

93

Plasma proteins were measured using the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) by Olink Proteomics

94

(Uppsala, Sweden). The Olink Inflammation Panel consisting of 92 inflammation-related biomarkers

95

was measured. This assay provides relative protein quantification expressed as normalized protein

96

expression (NPX) values on a log2 scale. The proteins for which the missing data frequency was over

97

20 % were excluded from the analysis. The remaining data under the detection limit was replaced

98

with the lower limit of detection for each protein. Measurements were normalized according to

99

inter-plate controls.

100

Flow Cytometry

101

Immune cell types in Cohort 1 were measured from whole blood by 10-color flow cytometry with

102

Navios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Staining and gating strategies were previously

103

described in detail by Aguirre-Gamboa et al. [16].

104

In vitro Stimulations and Cytokine Measurements

105

From the 452 individuals in Cohort 1, a sub-cohort of 50 people were asked to donate blood at 4

106

different time points in a year. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and cryo-

107

preserved between February 2016 and February 2017 to assess the seasonality of immune

108

responses. From those 50, we selected 20 individuals considering the optimal age and sex matching

109

of young-old and male-female comparisons. Therefore, cells isolated from 5 young males, 5 old

110

males, 5 young females, and 5 old females were included for an in vitro study assessing seasonality's

111

impact on the cytokine responses to SARS-CoV-2. Cohort demographics are shown in Supp. Table 3.

112

Upon thawing, PBMCs were stimulated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of

113

3.3×103 TCID50/mL and heat-inactivated Influenza A H1N1 (California strain) at a concentration of

114

3.3×105/mL for 24 hours and 5 days. Cytokine concentrations in the supernatants were measured

115

with DuoSet® ELISA kits (R&D Systems, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols.

116

Statistical Analyses

117

Statistical analyses were performed unsing R 3.6.1 (www.R-project.org) and GraphPad Prism 8

118

(GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA). After adjusting the data for the covariate sex using linear

119

regression, correlation of cell numbers or protein levels with age was done using Spearman's rank-

120

order correlation (Figures 2 and 4). Correction for sex was not applied in the heatmaps where two

121

sexes were analyzed separately. After adjusting the data for the covariate age, differential protein

122

expression or cell numbers between males and females was tested using the Mann-Whitney test

123

(Figures 3 and 5). For box plots comparing different age groups, the two sexes, or four seasons, the

124

Mann-Whitney test was used between any two groups. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was

125

employed to correct multiple testing errors for the heatmaps and volcano plots. False discovery rate

126

(FDR)-adjusted p-values smaller than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

129

Age-dependent Changes in Immune Cell Populations Linked to COVID-19 Severity

130

Various immune cell sub-types were correlated with age in Cohort 1. Non-classical monocytes

131

increased with advancing age in both sexes, but intermediate and classical monocyte numbers were

132

not significantly correlated with age. CD56bright NK population decreased with age in females while

133

other NK cell types remained unchanged (Figure 2). Previously, these results were partly reported by

134

our group [16].

135

Total T cell count was negatively correlated with age, indicating the lymphopenia already

136

experienced by the elderly, even in health, is likely to predispose to COVID-19 severity. Naïve T cells,

137

especially CD8+, exhibited the most striking age-dependent decline in both sexes. Naïve regulatory T

138

cells (Tregs) also decreased considerably with age in males, whereas memory Treg numbers were

139

elevated. Total and naïve B cell numbers were negatively correlated with age. Plasmablasts similarly

140

declined significantly in females. No significant age-related changes were observed among the other

141

B cell sub-types.

142

Overall, these results demonstrate that naïve CD4+, CD8+, Treg, and B cell pools, as well as CD56bright

143

NK cells, which are all depleted in severe COVID-19, also decrease with age. The differences are clear

144

even from the age of 50.

145
146

Sex-dependent Patterns of Immune Cell Populations Linked to COVID-19 Severity

147

Next, we investigated the differential abundance of the same immune cell populations influencing

148

COVID-19 severity in females vs. males. Only CD8+ effector memory T cells were significantly more

149

abundant in males (Figure 3). Almost all cell types, including neutrophils, naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,

150

memory T cells, class-switched memory B cell, and CD56bright NK cell counts, were significantly higher

151

in females. The T cell types and CD56bright NK cells, which are depleted in severe COVID-19 and

152

elderly healthy people, are also apparently less abundant in males.

Age-dependent Changes in Immune Mediator Proteins Linked to COVID-19 Severity

155

We selected 28 proteins whose plasma concentrations have been associated with severe COVID-19

156

and correlated them with age in healthy cohorts. Circulating IL-6 concentrations increased with age

157

in healthy women, while IL-18 concentrations were higher in healthy men with advancing age in

158

Cohort 1 (Figure 4). IL-8 concentrations positively correlated with old age in both females and males;

159

however, it was only significant when sexes were combined. Among investigated chemokines, only

160

MCP-1 was positively correlated with age in females in Cohort 2.

161

TNF-family proteins in plasma also changed with increasing age: TNF and TNFB concentrations were

162

significantly lower in the circulation of older men in Cohort 1 and 2, respectively. TRANCE sharply

163

declined in older individuals, more strikingly in males, while TWEAK was positively correlated only in

164

females with advancing age. Moreover, aging in males was associated with elevated osteoprotegerin

165

(OPG) concentrations, and HGF concentrations exhibited a considerable age-dependent increase in

166

females in both cohorts.

167

In summary, several proteins in plasma that are increased in severe COVID-19 patients, such as IL-6,

168

IL-8, IL-18, MCP-1, OPG, and HGF, are more abundant in healthy elderly compared to young

169

individuals. Furthermore, proteins that are lower in severe COVID-19, e.g., TRANCE, decline with age.

170
171

Sex-dependent Patterns of Immune Mediator Proteins Linked to COVID-19 Severity

172

We also compared plasma protein concentrations between sexes. It must be noted that Koeken et

173

al. previously reported that males and females of Cohort 2 exhibit differences in baseline levels of

174

many inflammatory markers [17]. Here we provide a more detailed analysis of COVID-19-related

175

proteins among those in Cohorts 1 and 2. We observed a similar sex-dependent trend in both

176

cohorts (Figure 5). Only OPG and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), related to severe COVID-19,

177

were significantly higher in women. On the other hand, plasma concentrations of other severity

178

markers such as IL-8, IL-18, MCP-1, MCP-2, CCL3, and CCL4 were all higher in men. Furthermore,

9

179

TRAIL, TWEAK, and TRANCE, which are all lower in COVID-19 patients in ICU, were more abundant in

180

males [9]. Males exhibited more anti-inflammatory proteins, e.g., PD-L1 and IL-10. Growth factors

181

HGF and SCF were also more abundant in male plasma.

182

These analyses show that most of the inflammatory mediators playing a role in infection severity are

183

already higher in the circulation of healthy men.

184

We hypothesized that circulating inflammatory proteins could be related to impaired cytokine

185

response against the virus. Therefore, we correlated SARS-CoV-2-induced in vitro cytokine

186

productions with baseline circulating protein concentrations in a sub-cohort of Cohort 1. Indeed,

187

PBMCs of the individuals with higher baseline plasma levels of MCP-2 and IL-8 produced more IL-1RA

188

against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Supp. Figure 1). Furthermore, MCP-1 was negatively correlated with

189

IFNγ production. The data indicate that higher baseline plasma concentrations of MCP-2, IL-8, and

190

MCP-1 are associated with the inability to produce an optimal defense against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

191
192

Sex, Age, and Season as Influencing Factors of Immune Response Against SARS-CoV-2

193

Next, we investigated the impact of seasonality on the SARS-CoV-2-induced immune response and

194

assessed the contribution of age and sex. To this end, we selected 20 individuals from Cohort 1, for

195

which cryo-preserved cells collected at 4 roughly equidistant time points in one year were available.

196

We stimulated their PBMCs with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A H1N1.

197

We found that cytokine production upon SARS-CoV-2 stimulation did not substantially vary during

198

the year, considering all 20 individuals (Supp. Figure 2). However, SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine

199

production did differ for different age groups and sexes throughout the year. Cytokines of the IL-1

200

biological pathway were higher in the elderly: IL-1β production tended to be greater in the elderly

201

than in young individuals (Figure 6A), while SARS-CoV-2 induced more IL-1RA all-year-round in the

202

old individuals(Figure 6B). Interestingly, IFNγ production upon stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 had a

10

203

different seasonal profile in the young and elderly: young individuals produced more IFNγ in the

204

summer and fall (Figure 6C). Remarkably, the elderly did not display this seasonal effect, with low

205

IFNγ production throughout the year. TNFα and IL-6 productions upon stimulation were similar in

206

the young and the elderly (Supp. Figure 3A-B). In addition, IL-1β production in response to SARS-

207

CoV-2 in spring and summer was higher in females; however, the average yearly response failed to

208

reach statistical significance (Figure 6D). IL-1RA and IFNγ production in males and females were

209

comparable (Figure 6E-F).

210

Stimulating PBMCs using another RNA virus, influenza H1N1, resulted in a similar pattern to SARS-

211

CoV-2 stimulation regarding the age and sex effects. The elderly tended to produce more IL-1β and

212

IL-1RA, while young individuals could produce higher IFNγ amounts upon influenza stimulation

213

(Supp. Figure 4). Similar amounts of IL-1β, IL-1RA, and IFNγ were induced in males and females on

214

average, with few exceptions (Supp. Figure 4D-F).

215

These data show that individuals of distinct ages and sexes respond differently to SARS-CoV-2

216

infection depending on the seasons of the year.

217
218

DISCUSSION

219

Old age and male sex are important risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Several studies have

220

investigated whether immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection are influenced by

221

demographic factors such as age and sex [18, 19]. Although they identified immune profiles

222

associated with severe COVID-19, they could not assess whether these were secondarily induced by

223

the disease, or due to a-priori immune differences between different groups. In the present study,

224

we show that the immune characteristics associated with severe COVID-19, such as specific changes

225

in cell populations and circulating inflammatory proteins, are already present in healthy elderly and

226

men. Interestingly, while the season did not impact the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 stimulation

11

227

in the entire group, there was a clear difference in the responses between the young and old. Young

228

individuals, but not the elderly, improve their IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 during the summer.

229

COVID-19 progression to a severe clinical picture is related to the depletion of several immune cell

230

types, including naïve CD4+ and CD8+, and CD56high NK cells. Our study demonstrates the age-related

231

decline of these cells in healthy individuals even before the infection, which likely contributes to

232

their incapacity to eliminate the virus. These data are supported by studies suggesting that some of

233

these cell types are scarcer in uninfected elderly and males [20, 21]. Naïve B lymphocyte numbers

234

were also reduced with advanced age, which would undermine the development of adaptive

235

immunity and antibody production upon infection [22]. The aging process does not only alter cell

236

numbers, but also the functions (Figure 6C) [23]. All these might cumulatively disrupt the response

237

against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

238

We showed that one of the striking differences in immune cell types between males and females

239

was the number of CD4+ T cells. Although we cannot rule out that significant differences in cell

240

populations might not determine the disease severity, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were

241

strongly linked with milder COVID-19, unlike antibodies and CD8+ T cell numbers [24]. Fast induction

242

of CD4+ T cells was related to a milder disease, while defects in inducing SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T

243

cells were associated with severe or fatal COVID-19.

244

An exaggerated systemic inflammation has been associated with severe COVID-19, mirrored by high

245

circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators [25]. Among those, IL-8, IL-18, and MCP-1

246

have been frequently reported, and the first two characterize the immune response of men with a

247

severe outcome [8]. Notably, their concentrations are already higher in both men and the elderly in

248

our healthy cohorts. Another protein displaying the same pattern is HGF, acting on epithelial and T

249

cells promoting migration [26], which has higher concentrations in the circulation of severe patients

250

[27]. The circulating HGF concentrations are higher in men, but also increases with age in women.

251

Chemokines are critical inflammatory mediators, and MCP-2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL19, and CXCL10 are all

252

more abundant in males. ENRAGE (S100A12), produced by neutrophils and monocytes, is also higher

253

in healthy males than females. Monocytes expressing high S100A12 and IL-8 are linked to COVID-19

254

severity [28]. Additionally, anti-inflammatory proteins IL-10 and PD-L1 are elevated in healthy males

255

and severe COVID-19. Initially considered a negative feedback mechanism for infection-induced

256

inflammation, there are arguments suggesting these proteins as biomarkers of immune exhaustion,

257

which is likely to play a substantial role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 [29, 30]. Notably, the

258

association of early IL-10 production with COVID-19 severity supports this idea [31].

259

Severity markers increasing with old age, but not affected by sex, include IL-6 and OPG. IL-6 secreted

260

by hyperactive monocytes contributes to low HLA-DR expression and lymphopenia in severe COVID-

261

19 [32]. TNF-family cytokine receptor OPG, abundant in ICU patients, increases with old age in our

262

healthy cohorts [9]. High OPG concentrations in females are likely due to estrogen's effects

263

promoting OPG expression to inhibit bone resorption [33]. Another TNF-family member, TRANCE

264

(RANKL), which is lower in severe COVID-19 cases, also declines with advancing age in healthy

265

individuals. T cells are one of the primary TRANCE sources, which might explain its scarcity in the

266

elderly and severe COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia [34].

267

Of note, concentrations of circulating IL-7 and IFNγ, which are increased in severe COVID-19, are

268

similar in men and women. Therefore, T cell numbers being higher in women is unlikely due to IL-7-

269

induced lymphopoiesis, whereas higher T cell numbers do not necessarily lead to more circulating

270

IFNγ. An overview of the age- and sex-dependent immune profiles in healthy individuals potentially

271

predisposing to severe COVID-19 upon infection is provided in Figure 7.

272

Environmental factors are also known to affect immune responses. Certain infections such as

273

influenza follow a seasonal pattern [35], and the evolution of the pandemic last year also suggested

274

that COVID-19 incidence might follow a seasonal variation [14]. Therefore, we questioned whether

275

this might be due to seasonal changes in the immune response to the virus. In the entire group, we

276

found no clear seasonal response against SARS-CoV-2, although this could be due to the limited

277

sample size. Interestingly, young individuals improve their IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 during the

278

summer, while the elderly do not. Further research with larger cohorts is required to validate

279

seasonality's full impact on anti-SARS-CoV-2 host defense.

280

Our results indicate that the immune response upon in vitro SARS-CoV-2 stimulation varies

281

depending on age and sex. The response of the elderly is characterized by low IFNγ and elevated IL-

282

1RA production. IFNγ is crucial for an effective response of T- and NK cells to viral infections, and its

283

deficiency is associated with severe COVID-19 [36]. Depleted NK and T cell pools might explain why

284

the elderly are less capable of producing IFNγ upon SARS-CoV-2 stimulation. Poor IFNγ response,

285

especially in the fall, might put the elderly at higher risk for severe COVID-19. Men and women

286

produce comparable amounts of IFNγ, although the T cell numbers are higher in women. Other roles

287

of T cells besides IFN production may contribute to the better prognosis of women with COVID-19.

288

One important point is that these defects are present in the whole population, not at the individual

289

level: while the elderly as a group have lower immune responses, there are certainly aged individuals

290

who have effective immune reaction. This inter-individual variability could be the reason why some

291

elderly or some men have good responses against SARS-CoV-2 and develop only mild disease.

292

In COVID-19, an overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines contributes to the pathophysiology

293

late in the disease [37]. On the other hand, cytokines such as IL-1β might also be crucial for an early

294

anti-viral response. The deficiency of IL-1β or its receptor causes higher viral load and mortality in

295

murine models [38]. Furthermore, genetic variants in IL1B contribute to influenza susceptibility in

296

humans [39]. We observed higher IL-1β production in women in response to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro,

297

arguing that an initial potent anti-viral defense is essential to prevent severe disease. Moreover, IL-

298

1RA is an antagonist of IL-1 bioactivity, helping prevent excessive inflammation [40]. However, early

299

IL-1RA production in patients is associated with COVID-19 severity [31], while our finding of higher

300

IL-1RA production in the elderly suggests that IL-1RA might be hindering their ability to mount an

301

optimal immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, high IL-1RA production with increasing

302

age might mirror the general inflammatory profile of elderly individuals.

303

In conclusion, our findings shed light on the immunological factors that might explain why men and

304

the elderly have a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. These results also emphasize the

305

importance of the IL1β/IL-1RA axis and IFNγ in anti-SARS-CoV-2 response. We propose that

306

intrinsically different immune characteristics, including plasma inflammatory mediators and immune

307

cell populations, in healthy people would influence their immune response upon SARS-CoV-2

308

infection and the severity of the disease. Results of this study inform prophylactic and therapeutic

309

efforts.
