Abstract

49

The SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein mediates attachment and entry into host cells and

50

is a major target of vaccine and drug design. Potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies derived

51

from closely related antibody heavy chain genes (IGHV3-53 or 3-66) have been isolated from

52

multiple COVID-19 convalescent individuals. These usually contain minimal somatic mutations

53

and bind the S receptor-binding domain (RBD) to interfere with attachment to the cellular receptor

54

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used antigen-specific single B cell sorting to isolate

55

S-reactive monoclonal antibodies from the blood of a COVID-19 convalescent individual. The

56

seven most potent neutralizing antibodies were somatic variants of the same IGHV3-53-derived

57

antibody and bind the RBD with varying affinity. We report X-ray crystal structures of four Fab

58

variants bound to the RBD and use the structures to explain the basis for changes in RBD affinity.

59

We show that a germline revertant antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizes

60

virus, and that gains in affinity for the RBD do not necessarily correlate with increased

61

neutralization potency, suggesting that somatic mutation is not required to exert robust antiviral

62

effect. Our studies clarify the molecular basis for a heavily germline-biased human antibody

63

response to SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

74

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 48 million infections with more than 1.2

75

million deaths worldwide. Vaccines and therapeutic agents are urgently needed, particularly as

76

certain parts of the world now face new waves of infections. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)

77

is a large and heavily glycosylated protein that forms trimers of heterodimers on the surface of

78

virions. Each S protomer has two functional subunits; S1, which contains a receptor-binding

79

domain (RBD) that binds to ACE21,2, and S2, which mediates fusion of the viral and host cell

80

membranes during viral entry.

81

Epitopes for neutralizing antibodies on S include sites on the RBD and on the S1 N-

82

terminal domain (NTD)3-8. IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66 antibody genes are identical except for a single

83

amino acid mutation in an antibody framework region (FWR)9, and potent SARS-CoV-2

84

neutralizing antibodies derived from these two germline genes have been isolated from multiple

85

COVID-19 convalescent individuals3,4,8,10-13. The S RBDs can be in “down” or “up”

86

conformations14,15, and ACE2 and IGHV3-53/3-66 neutralizing antibodies can only bind the RBD

87

when it is “up” 8,16. Although described IGHV3-53/3-66 neutralizing antibodies have short CDR H3

88

loops, some IGHV3-53 antibodies with longer CDR H3 loops can make contacts with neighboring

89

RBDs to close the trimer17.

90

Here, we used single B-cell sorting to isolate a panel of monoclonal antibodies that react

91

against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein from the memory B cells of a COVID-19 convalescent

92

individual. The most potent neutralizing antibodies were seven somatically related variants of a

93

single IGVH3-53-derived antibody that binds the RBD with varying affinity. We use X-ray crystal

94

structures of Fab/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes to explain the basis for gains or losses in RBD

95

affinity that occurred during antibody maturation. We show that a germline revertant of the

96

antibody binds tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and that gains affinity for the RBD are not

97

associated with higher neutralization potency. We propose that such a focused germline-biased

antibody to SARS-CoV-2 may be particularly vulnerable to antibody neutralization escape as the

99

virus continues to circulate in humans.

101

Results

102

Related antibodies dominate the SARS-CoV-2 B-cell response in a convalescent donor

103

To study neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, we obtained a peripheral blood

104

sample from a healthy individual (“C1”) who had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 five weeks prior

105

to sampling. Polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified from the blood of this individual

106

neutralized SARS-CoV-2 but not vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lentivirus pseudotype (Fig. 1a).

107

We generated a soluble SARS-CoV-2 S construct that is stabilized through mutations and the

108

addition of trimerization tag to adopt the S “pre-fusion” conformation (“S2P”)14 and used it as an

109

antigen to isolate 116 memory B cells (CD19+, IgG+) by FACS (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We could

110

produce 48 recombinant monoclonal antibodies in sufficient amount for further characterization.

111

Forty-three of these antibodies bound S2P by ELISA, and 18 also bound the RBD (Supplementary

112

Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). Most antibodies were derived from the IGHV3 heavy chain

113

subgroup and had kappa light chains (Fig.1b). Antibody CDR H3 and CDR L3 loops had an

114

average length of 15 and 9 amino acids, respectively, with low frequencies of somatic

115

hypermutation in variable heavy and light chain sequences (Fig.1c-d and Supplementary Table

116

1).

117

Of the 43 antibodies we tested, only eight neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype with

118

greater than 90% reduction in entry at a screening concentration of 100 µg ml-1 (Supplementary

119

Fig. 1c). IC50 values ranged from 0.008 to 0.671 µg ml-1 in dose response pseudotype

120

neutralization assays (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2a). These eight antibodies also

121

neutralized infectious SARS-CoV-2, but authentic virus was more resistant to antibody

122

neutralization than pseudotype (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

123

The only antibodies that neutralized infectious SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 value of less than

124

1 µg ml-1 – C1A-B3, -F10, -C2, -H5, -C4, -B12, and -H6 – were somatic variants of the same

125

IGHV3-53/IGKV1-9-derived antibody (Supplementary Table 1). Each had a low number of amino

126

acid substitutions in the heavy and light chain variable genes (Fig. 1e). Monomeric Fabs derived

127

from these antibodies bound tightly to the RBD, with affinities ranging from 66 nM to 1 nM (Fig.

128

1e and Supplementary Fig. 3). C1A-B12, which we used as a representative member of the C1A-

129

IGHV3 antibodies, prevented an ACE2-Fc fusion protein from binding to the RBD in a biolayer

130

interferometry (BLI)-based competition assay (Fig. 2a). The Fab of CR3022, a human antibody

131

that does not compete with ACE2-binding18, did not affect C1A-B12 Fab or ACE2-Fc binding to

132

the RBD (Fig. 2a).

133

Structures of Fab/SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes

134

To better understand the effects of somatic mutations on RBD affinity, we determined

135

X-ray crystal structures of the RBD bound to four Fabs: C1A-B3, -B12, -C2, and -F10 (Fig. 2b).

136

The Fabs engage the RBD through an identical binding mode with root mean square deviations

137

(r.m.s.d.) of 0.36-0.39 Å by structural superposition. As with other IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66-derived

138

antibodies4,8,10,12,19, CDR loops H1, H2, H3, and L1 make the majority of RBD contacts (Fig. 2b).

139

As suggested by the results of competition assays (Fig. 2a), the antibodies and ACE2 bind the

140

same site on the RBD (Fig. 2c). Most of the contacts are polar and involve backbone and

141

sidechain atoms on both sides of the interface (Fig. 2d-g). Somatic mutations in the C1A-IGHV3-3

142

antibodies occurred in CDR loops and FWRs, and in the structure, some (e.g., the F10S and

143

S14F mutations in the light chain) are positioned far from the RBD and unlikely to impact antigen

144

affinity (Fig. 3).

148

Structural basis for affinity maturation of IGHV3-53-derived antibodies

149

High-resolution X-ray crystal structures of multiple clonotypes allowed us to examine the

150

effects of somatic mutations on the interaction interface. We also included in our analysis eight

151

additional IGHV3-53/3-66-derived SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies isolated in other studies

152

from multiple donors (B38, CC12.1, CC12.3, CV30, C105, BD-236, and BD-629)4,8,10,12,19. These

153

antibodies have an essentially identical binding mode on the RBD (Supplementary Fig. S4).

154

As examples of mutations at the Fab/RBD interface mutations that likely increase affinity

155

for the RBD, the VH S31N and the S31R mutations, which are found in C1A-C2 and BD-629,

156

respectively, provide new contacts with RBD Q474 and K458 (Fig. 4a-c). The VH S56T mutation,

157

which occurs in most of the C1A-IGHV3-53 antibodies (Fig. 3), positions a methyl group in van

158

der Waals contact with RBD T415 and the side chains of Y52 and Y58 on the antibody (Fig. 4d-

159

e). On the light chain, the N92I substitution creates a new hydrophobic contact with RBD Y505

160

(Fig. 4g-h). The VH T28I somatic mutation, which we did not observe in C1A-IGVH3-53 antibodies,

161

is probably important as it independently occurred in CV3019, B384, and BD-6298 (Supplementary

162

Fig. 5a). This change adds a hydrophobic contact with the Cα atom of RBD G476 and probably

163

also helps orient CDR H1 to optimize neighboring polar contacts (Supplementary Fig. 5c-e). The

164

residue at position 26 in the CDR H1 loop of IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies is almost uniformly a

165

glycine, but BD-629 contains a unique substitution (G26E) that provides a new set of polar

166

contacts with the RBD (Supplementary Fig. 5e).

167

As has been well described in antibody responses to influenza virus and HIV20,21, somatic

168

hypermutation that are not at antibody/antigen interfaces can nevertheless substantially

169

contribute to affinity gains by influencing CDR loop configuration and flexibility. The VH A24V

170

mutation is a pocket-filling mutation that, through hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of

171

VH F27, would rigidify CDR H1 may “pre-configure” it in a conformation that is compatible with

172

RBD binding (Fig. 4i-j). VH F27 is frequently mutated to a smaller hydrophobic residues during

6

173

somatic hypermutation; it is replaced by an isoleucine in C1A-H5, BD-604, and BD-2368, by a

174

leucine in CC12.112, and by a valine in CV3019 (Fig. 4k; Supplementary Fig. 5a and 5c). In contrast

175

to the VH A24V mutation, replacing VH F27 with smaller hydrophobic residue would likely make

176

CDR H1 more flexible as opposed to rigidifying it, and this added flexibility could allow optimization

177

of local polar contacts, particularly as additional mutations are introduced during affinity

178

maturation (the T28I change in addition to the F27V mutation in CV30)19 (Supplementary Fig.

179

5c).

180

Affinity is not the only property that may be beneficial to an effective antibody response22,

181

and antibody combining site diversity may provide broader protection against pathogens that are

182

antigenically variable and evolve over time23. As examples of BCR diversification that could result

183

in a loss of RBD affinity, the of VH S56A mutation in C1A-B12 removes a polar contact with RBD

184

D420, and the Y58F mutation in CC12.1 removes a polar contact with the backbone carbonyl of

185

RBD T415 (Fig. 4f; Supplementary Fig. 5f-g).

186

IGHV3-53/3-66-derived SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies usually have short CDR H3

187

loops to avoid clashes with the RBD surface12 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Six of the seven clonally

188

related IGH/V3-53 antibodies we isolated contain the S100aR mutation in CDR H3 with

189

independent substitutions at the nucleotide level (Fig. 5a), suggesting that this adaptation was

190

recurrently selected for during the affinity maturation process. We observed two alternate

191

conformations for the R100a side chain in the C1A-B12 Fab/RBD structure; it can either contact

192

the side chain of RBD Q493 or the backbone carbonyl of RBD S494 (Fig. 5b). The R100a side

193

chain also helps position neighboring antibody residues to make additional contacts with the RBD

194

as part of a larger network of polar interactions involving water molecules.

195

Germline revertant antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2

196

To better understand the selective pressure driving the expansion of the IGVH3-53 class

197

of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and the role of the S100aR somatic change in affinity

198

maturation, we generated an antibody revertant in which all positions are reverted to their

199

germline counterparts (C1A-gl), and another that only retains the S100aR substitution (C1A-gl*)

200

(Fig. 3 and Fig. 5c). Monomeric C1A-gl and C1A-gl* Fabs bound the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD with

201

affinities of 127 nM and C1A-gl* and 46 nM, respectively (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 3). The

202

effect of the mutation was most pronounced on antibody on-rate, suggesting that the CDR H3

203

S100aR substitution allows the antibody to more effectively dock onto the RBD. C1A-gl and C1A-

204

gl* IgG neutralized infectious SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 0.126 and 0.102 µg ml-1,

205

respectively (Fig. 4e).

206

We next sought to address whether C1A-IGHV3 antibodies could neutralize SARS-CoV-2

207

containing the D614G mutation in S, which is found in a circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain with

208

increased infectivity 24-26. C1A-gl, which binds the RBD with 126 nM affinity, and C1A-B12, which

209

binds the RBD with thirty-fold higher affinity (KD of 4 nM), neutralized SARS-CoV-2 S D614G

210

pseudotypes with comparable IC50 values (74 and 34 ng ml-1, respectively) (Fig. 5f). Taken

211

together, our results suggest that once a threshold RBD affinity is reached for IGHV3-53

212

antibodies, gains in affinity are not necessarily associated with more potent virus neutralization.

213
214

Discussion

215

In the absence of effective vaccines or therapeutics, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has

216

continued unabated with most of the world now facing new waves of infection despite aggressive

217

infection control measures. A detailed understanding of the human antibody response to this

218

novel virus will be required to design safe and effective agents to be used as prophylaxis or early

219

treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including countermeasures that anticipate changes in the

220

virus that could lead to antibody neutralization escape. Multiple groups have now reported on

221

IGHV3-53/3-66-derived antibodies isolated from COVID-19 convalescent donors that carry low

222

rates of somatic mutation and potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 – these recognize the RBD with

223

essentially the same binding mode (Supplementary Fig. 4)3,4,8,10-13. In the donor we studied, the

224

neutralizing antibody response was dominated by this class of antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 1

225

and Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that in certain scenarios, the preponderance of such

226

antibodies could drive selective evolution of antibody neutralization escape.

227

The high “baseline affinity” IGHV3-53/3-66-derived germline antibodies have for the

228

SARS-CoV-2 RBD is likely driven by the extensive network of reciprocal polar contacts these

229

make with both main and side chain atoms of the RBD (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Supplementary Fig. 5).

230

Our ability to detect robust RBD binding for monomeric Fabs representing germline revertant

231

antibody sequences (Fig. 5) in an assay that does not take into account the avidity that would be

232

observed with B cell receptors engaging trimeric S suggests that strong selective pressure drives

233

the evolution of antibody responses against this epitope. Our results stand somewhat in contrast

234

to those observed with antibody CV30, an IGHV3-53/IGVΚ3-20 antibody for which reversion of

235

its only two substitutions (VH F27V and T28I) with respect to the germline antibody, results in a

236

change in affinity from 3.6 nM to 407 nM and in an almost sixty fold change in neutralization IC50

237

value (from 0.030 µg ml-1 to 16.5 µg ml-1)19. As described in our analysis, the VH F27V and T28I

238

mutations may respectively affect loop dynamicity and help optimize the geometry of CDR H1

239

contacts with the RBD19. The lack of a drastic change in affinity with reversion of germline antibody

240

sequences with C1A-IGHV3-53 antibodies suggest that these take better advantage of antigen

241

complementarity afforded by their CDR H3 loop and light chain gene (IGVK1-9 for C1A-IGHV3-

242

53 antibodies and IGVK3-20 for CV30) (Supplementary Fig. 4).

243

While we did not observe a correlation between RBD affinity and virus neutralization, we

244

did not measure affinities with full length SARS-CoV-2 S. IGHV3-53/3-66 neutralizing antibodies

245

can only bind the RBD when it is “up”8,16, and efficient virus neutralization by engagement of an

246

epitope that is transiently exposed likely requires optimization of binding on- and off-rates in

247

addition to gains in overall affinity.

248

Mutations that allow SARS-CoV-2 S to escape neutralization by antibodies that compete

249

with ACE2 binding have been observed in vitro27 and recently in circulating strains28. Although

250

SARS-CoV-2 encodes an exonuclease that increases the fidelity of replication of its large RNA

251

genome, recurrence of an identical antibody response in multiple COVID-19 convalescent

252

individuals suggests that selective pressure against the RBD-binding site for ACE2 is substantial.

253

To broadly protect against emerging S variants and to counter evolution of neutralization escape

254

over time as the virus circulates in humans, vaccine design efforts may need to focus on potent

255

neutralizing antibodies binding additional sites on SARS-CoV-2 S, rather than on clonal expansion

256

of one or a limited set of IGVH3-53/3-66-derived antibodies, as occurred during natural infection

257

of the convalescent donor we studied.

This study was approved by the Harvard Medical School Office of Human Research

262

Administration Institutional Review Board (IRB20-0365) as was the use of healthy donor control

273

B cells in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% (v/v) FBS. We adjusted the B cells to a

274

density of 1x107 cells and incubated cells with biotinylated SARS CoV-2 spike (S2P) at a

275

concentration of 5 μg ml-1 on ice for 30 min. After washing three times and resuspending the cells,

276

we added anti-IgG-APC antibody (BD Biosciences), anti-CD19-FITC antibody (BD Biosciences),

277

and streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen). After incubating the cells on ice for 30 min, we washed cells

278

three times in PBS containing 2% (v/v) FBS and passed the suspension through a cell strainer

279

before sorting.

281

We performed single cell cDNA synthesis using SuperScriptTM III reverse transcriptase

282

(Invitrogen) followed by nested PCR amplification to obtain the IgH, Igλ, and IgΚ variable

283

segments from memory B cells as previously described30. We used IMGT/V-QUEST31

284

(http://www.imgt.org) to analyze IgG gene usage and the extent of variable segment somatic

285

hypermutation. The variable segments were cloned into the pVRC8400 vector for expression of

286

the IgG and Fab constructs as previously described32.

293

was a gift from Huihui Mou and Michael Farzan and an Expi293F-His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S2P

294

295

the addition of 1 µg ml-1 puromycin. We maintained HEK293T cells grown in suspension in

296

FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Gibco) and HEK293S GnTI-/- cells (ATCC CRL-3022) in

GlutaMax (Gibco), 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin, 10% (v/v) FBS and 1µg ml-1 puromycin. The

300

cell line was then adapted to suspension culture and maintained in Expi293TM expression medium

301

supplemented with 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin and 1 µg ml-1 puromycin (Gibco).

302

Passage 4 SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/202033 was received from the University of Texas Medical

303

Branch. A T225 flask of VeroE6 cells was inoculated with 90 µl starting material in 15 ml DMEM

304

containing 2% (v/v) of heat inactivated FBS (HI-FBS) and incubated in a humidified incubator at

305

37 oC with periodic rocking for 1 h. After 1 h, 60 ml of DMEM / 2% (v/v) HI-FBS was added without

306

removing the inoculum and incubated again at 37 oC. The flask was observed daily for progression

307

of cytopathic effect and stock was harvested at 66 h post-inoculation. Stock supernatant was

308

harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 5,250 relative centrifugal field (RCF) at 4°C for 10 min

309

and the HI-FBS concentration was increased to 10% (v/v) final concentration.

311

Protein production

312

For single B cell sorting we cloned a construct for SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank ID: QHD43416.1

313

residues 16-1208) with a “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site (residues 682-685),

314

stabilized in the prefusion conformation through proline substitutions at residues 986 and 98714,

315

and a C-terminal foldon trimerization motif followed by a BirA ligase site, a Tobacco Etch Virus

316

(TEV) protease site, a FLAG tag, and a His6-tag into a pHLsec vector34, which contains its own

317

secretion signal sequence. We note that two N-terminal S residues (residues 14 and 15)

318

downstream of the native S signal peptide were inadvertently omitted from the S2P construct

319

during subcloning. We transfected Expi293FTM cells using an ExpiFectamineTM transfection kit

320

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. We purified the protein using

321

anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) according to manufacturer’s protocol and removed the FLAG

322

tag and His6-tag with TEV digestion followed by reverse nickel affinity purification and size-

323

exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). We

324

biotinylated the protein with BirA ligase as previously described32.

325
326

To obtain recombinant S2P for ELISAs, we used Ni Sepharose® Excel (GE Healthcare Life

327

Sciences) to purify His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S2P from the supernatant of Expi293F cells stably

328

expressing this protein. We further purified the protein using size exclusion chromatography on a

329

Superpose 6 Increase column.

330
331

We expressed and purified recombinant monoclonal antibodies and Fab fragments using the

332

pVRC8400 vector as previously described32. To generate the CR3022 control Fab, we amplified

333

its variable heavy chain and light chain gene regions (GenBank IDs: DQ168569.1 and

334

DQ168570.1) from cDNA (a gift from Galit Alter) and subcloned these into the pVRC8400 vector.

335

We used size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase column (S200, GE

336

Healthcare Life Sciences) for all Fabs, which eluted as single peaks at the expected retention

337

volume.

338
339

We subcloned constructs for the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD (GenBank ID: QHD43416.1 residues 319-

340

541) into the pHLsec34 vector for use in ELISAs, BLI binding studies, and X-ray crystallography.

341

For ELISAs and crystallography the construct includes an N-terminal His6-tag, a TEV protease

342

site and a short linker (amino acids SGSG). For BLI-binding assays, the construct includes an N-

343

terminal His6-tag, followed by a TEV protease site, a BirA ligase site, and a 7-residue linker. We

344

produced protein for ELISA and BLI-binding assays by using linear polyethylenimine (PEI) to

345

transfect HEK293T cells grown in suspension and purified by nickel affinity purification. For BLI-

346

binding assays the protein was digested with TEV protease to remove the His6-tag followed by

347

reverse nickel affinity purification. We biotinylated protein with BirA ligase as previously

348

described35, followed by a reverse nickel affinity purification step to remove BirA ligase, which

349

contains a His6-tag and cannot be separated by size exclusion chromatography from the SARS-

350

CoV-2 RBD due to its similar size. For crystallography, we produced the protein by PEI

351

transfection of GnTI-/- HEK293S cells grown in suspension or HEK293T cells grown in suspension

352

and also in presence of kifunensine (5 µM), purified by nickel affinity purification, and removed

353

the His6-tag by TEV digestion followed by reverse nickel affinity purification. As a final step, we

354

used size exclusion on a S200 Increase column, in which each recombinant RBD protein ran as

355

a single peak at the expected retention volume.

356
357

We subcloned the ectodomain of human ACE2 (GenBank ID: BAB40370.1 residues 18-740, with

358

cDNA obtained as a gift cDNA from Michael Farzan, with a C-terminal Fc tag into a pVRC8400

359

vector containing human IgG1 Fc (a gift from Aaron Schmidt). We expressed the protein in

360

Expi293FTM cells using an ExpiFectamineTM transfection kit according to the manufacturer’s

361

protocol, and purified the protein using MabSelect SuRE Resin using the manufacturer’s protocol,

362

followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase column, with the protein

363

eluting at the expected retention volume.

364
365

Crystallization

366

We prepared each Fab:SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex by mixing RBD with 1.5 molar excess of Fab.

367

The mixtures were incubated at 4°C for 1 h prior to purification on a Superdex 200 Increase SEC

368

column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) in buffer containing 150mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.

369

Each complex co-eluted as a single peak at expected retention volume. We adjusted the

370

concentration of each complex to 13 mg ml-1 and screened for crystallization conditions in hanging

371

drops containing 0.1 µl of protein and 0.1µl of mother liquor using a Mosquito protein

372

crystallization robot (SPT Labtech) with commercially available screens (Hampton Research) (see

373

Structure determination

381

All crystals were flash frozen in mother liquor supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol as

382

cryoprotectant. We collected single crystal X-ray diffraction data on Eiger X 16M pixel detectors

383

(Dectris) at a wavelength of 0.979180 Å at the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Argonne, IL) NE-

384

CAT beamline 24-ID-E for the C1A-B12 Fab:RBD and C1A-B3 Fab:RBD complexes and NE-CAT

385

beamline 24-ID-C for the C1A-C2 Fab:RBD and C1A-F10 Fab:RBD complexes. Diffraction data

386

were indexed and integrated using XDS (build 202 00131)36 and merged using AIMLESS

387

(v0.5.32)37. The structure of C1A-B12 Fab:RBD (space group P212121) was determined by

388

molecular replacement using Phaser (v2.8.3)38, with coordinates for the B38 Fab variable domain,

389

constant domain and RBD (PDB ID: 7BZ5) (Wu et al., 2020) used as search models. Three copies

390

were found in the asymmetric unit (ASU). We performed iterative model using O39 and refinement

391

in Phenix (v1.18.2-3874)40 and Buster (v2.10.3)41, during which we also built alternative

392

conformations where density was apparent. During refinements, we updated TLS groups

393

calculated using Phenix40 and a python script, as well as occupancy restraints calculated in

394

Buster. During model building, we also customized geometry restraints to prevent large

395

displacement of unambiguous contacts in poor regions; the restraints were released once

396

refinements became stable. Water molecules were automatically picked and updated in Buster,

397

followed by manual examination and adjustment till late stage refinement. The structures of C1A-

398

B3:RBD (space group P212121, 3 copies per ASU), C1A-C2:RBD (space group C2221, 1 copy per

399

ASU) and C1A-F10:RBD (space group C2221, 1 copy per ASU) were determined using RBD and

400

the C1A-B12 Fab variable and constant domains as search ensembles with CDR and flexible

401

loops truncated, with iterative model building and refinement as described above. Data collection,

402

processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Figure S2.

Structural Analysis

405

We analyzed the structures and generated figures using PyMOL (Schrödinger).

Lentivirus pseudotype production

408

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Genbank ID: QJR84873.1 residues 1-1246) with a modified

409

cytoplasmic sequence that includes HIV gp41 residues (NRVRQGYS) replacing C-terminal

410

residues 1247-1273 of the S protein (gift from Nir Hacohen) was subcloned into the pCAGGS

411

expression vector. We used Gibson assembly to generate the S D614G mutant. A pCAGGS

412

expressor plasmid for VSV G was previously described42. To package lentivirus, we co-

413

transfected HEK293T cells using lipofectamineTM 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an

414

envelope gene-encoding pCAGGS vector, a packaging vector containing HIV Gag, Pol, Rev, and

415

Tat (psPAX2, provided by Didier Trono, Addgene #12260), and a transfer vector containing GFP

416

(lentiCas9-EGFP, a gift from Phillip Sharp and Feng Zhang, Addgene #63592)43 in which we

417

deleted Cas9. After 18 h, we changed the supernatant to DMEM containing 2 % FBS (v/v). We

418

harvested supernatants after 48 and 72 h, centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 min, and filtered the

419

supernatants through a 0.45 µm filter. To concentrate lentivirus pseudotypes, we layered the

420

supernatant on top of a 10% (v/v) sucrose cushion in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5

421

mM EDTA and spun samples at 10,000 x g for 4 h at 4 °C. We removed supernatants and

422

resuspended virus pellets in Opti-MEM containing 5% (v/v) FBS and stored these at -80 °C.

424

Pseudotype neutralization experiments

425

We purified polyclonal IgG from human plasma samples using PierceTM Protein G Ultra LinkTM

426

Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We pre-incubated

427

polyclonal serum IgG or monoclonal antibodies at a concentration with SARS-CoV-2 or VSV G

428

lentivirus pseudotypes in the presence of 0.5 µg ml-1 of polybrene for 1 h minutes at 37 °C. Virus

429

antibody mixtures were added to HEK293T-hACE2 with incubation on cells at 37 °C for 24 h, and

430

the media replaced with DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin (v/v),

431

and 1 µg ml-1 puromycin. We determined the percent of GFP positive cells by FACS with an iQue

432

Screener PLUS (Intellicyt) 48 h after initial infection. We calculated percent relative entry by using

433

the following equation: Relative Entry (%) = (% GFP positive cells in antibody well)/(%GFP

434

positive cells in no antibody control). We calculated percent neutralization using the following

435

equation: Neutralization (%) = 1 - (% GFP positive cells in nanobody well)/(% GFP positive cells

436

in PBS alone well).

Live virus PRNT experiments

439

Monoclonal antibody samples were serially diluted in Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline

440

(DPBS, Gibco) using half-log dilutions starting at a concentration of 50 µg ml-1. Dilutions were

441

prepared in triplicate for each sample and plated in triplicate. Each dilution was incubated at 37

442

°C for 1 h with 1,000 plaque-forming units ml-1 (PFU ml-1) of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA-

443

WA1/2020). 200 µl of each dilution was added to the confluent monolayers of NR-596 Vero E6

444

cells (ATCC) in triplicate and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 1 hour. The cells were

445

rocked gently every 15 min to prevent monolayer drying. Cells were then overlaid with a 1:1

446

solution of 2.5% (v/v) Avicel® RC-591 microcrystalline cellulose and carboxymethylcellulose

447

sodium (DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences) and 2x Modified Eagle Medium (MEM - Temin’s

448

modification, Gibco) supplemented with 100 X antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco) and 100X GlutaMAX

449

(Gibco) both to a final concentration of 2X, and 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco). The plates were then

450

incubated at 37 °C for 2 d. After two days, the monolayers were fixed with 10% (v/v) neutral

451

buffered formalin for at least 6 h (NBF, Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with 0.2% (v/v) aqueous

452

Gentian Violet (RICCA Chemicals) in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin for 30 min, followed by

453

rinsing and plaque counting.

ELISA experiments

456

We coated NUNC Maxisorp plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with His6-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S2P,

457

SARS-CoV-2 RBD, or LUJV GP1 in PBS overnight at 4 °C, followed by a blocking step with PBS

458

containing 3% (v/v) BSA 0.02% (v/v) Tween. We incubated monoclonal antibodies at a

459

concentration of 100 µg ml-1 for one hour. We detected bound antibody with horseradish

460

peroxidase (HRP)-coupled anti-human (Fc) antibody (Sigma Aldrich catalog number A0170).

461
462

Biolayer interferometry assays

463

We performed BLI experiments with an Octet RED96e (Sartorius). For affinity measurements,

464

biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD was loaded onto a streptavidin (SA) sensor (ForteBio) at 1.5 µg

465

ml-1 in kinetic buffer (PBS containing 0.02% Tween and 0.1% BSA) for 100 s. After a baseline

466

measurement for 60 s in kinetic buffer, antibody Fabs were associated for 300 s followed by a

467

300 s dissociation step.

468

For ACE2-Fc competition experiments, we loaded biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 RBD onto SA

469

sensors (ForteBio) at 1.5 µg ml-1 for 80 s. We associated C1A-B12 Fab or CR3022-Fab at 250

470

nM or buffer for 180 s followed by an association with ACE2-Fc or CR3022 Fab at a concentration

471

of 250 nM for 180 s. We allowed complexes to dissociate for 180 s.
