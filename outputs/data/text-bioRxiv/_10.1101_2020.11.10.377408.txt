Abstract:

37

Background: SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, and the etiologic agent for the current global health

38

emergency, causes acute infection of the respiratory tract leading to severe disease and significant mortality.

39

Ever since the start of SARS-CoV-2, also known as COVID-19 pandemic, countless uncertainties have

40

been revolving around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. While air

41

pollution has been shown to be strongly correlated to increased SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality,

42

whether environmental pollutants such as ground level ozone affects the susceptibility of individuals to

43

SARS-CoV-2 is not yet established.

44

Objective: To investigate the impact of ozone inhalation on the expression levels of signatures associated

45

with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

46

Methods: We analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to air or 0.8ppm

47

ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week), and analyzed the expression of signatures associated with

48

host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

49

Results: SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells requires proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease,

50

transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The TMPRSS2 protein and Tmprss2 transcripts were

51

significantly elevated in the extrapulmonary airways, parenchyma, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-

52

exposed mice. A significant proportion of additional known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were

53

upregulated in alveolar macrophages and parenchyma from ozone-exposed mice.

54

Conclusions: Our data indicate that the unhealthy levels of ozone in the environment may predispose

55

individuals to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the severity of this pandemic, and the challenges

56

associated with direct testing of host-environment interactions in clinical settings, we believe that this mice-

57

ozone-exposure based study informs the scientific community of the potentially detrimental effects of the

58

ambient ozone levels determining the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:

70

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, and an etiologic agent of the current global health emergency, causes

71

acute infection of the respiratory tract leading to severe disease and significant mortality 1. SARS-CoV-2

72

entry into the host cells is dependent upon the binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the host cellular

73

receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), and its proteolytic priming by the host-derived protease,

74

transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) 2. Therefore, the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 could

75

vary based on the expression of the host susceptibility proteins including ACE2 and TMPRSS2

76

example, increased expression of the host-derived protease, TMPRSS2, may promote the priming of SARS-

77

CoV-2, thus resulting in increased infectivity and disease severity. The current literature indicates that

78

individuals have varied susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 that may be dependent on age

79

underlying comorbidities 9, and the environmental pollution 10, 11. However, the list of factors determining

80

varied susceptibilities of human population to SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete.

. For

, gender 8,

81

Nearly one-third of the United States population lives in areas with unhealthy levels of ozone 12, 13.

82

While it is already known that the unhealthy levels of ozone increase the risk for developing

83

cardiopulmonary health problems

84

expression of host susceptibility proteins to SARS-CoV-2 and, in turn, accounts for the

85

susceptibilities of the human population to SARS-CoV-2. Addressing this critical question is highly

86

relevant in terms of increasing our mechanistic understanding of the host-air pollution (environment)

87

interactions underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and epidemiology, and for developing future

88

preventative and therapeutic strategies.

, it is unclear whether the ambient ozone levels regulate the

To begin to understand the impact of ozone inhalation on the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2,

90

we analyzed lung tissues collected from mice that were sub-chronically exposed to filtered-air or 0.8ppm

ozone for three weeks (4h/night, 5 nights/week)

92

signatures associated with host susceptibility to

93

immunohistochemistry for assessing expression levels of TMPRSS2 protein in three different lung tissue

94

compartments. To determine the RNA levels of Tmprss2 in a cell-specific manner, in situ gene expression

95

was assessed for Tmprss2 gene using RNAscope approach. Finally, the mRNA expression levels of 32

96

known SARS-CoV-2 host susceptibility genes were assessed in three lung tissue compartments using

97

RNASeq approach. Our findings indicate that host-environment interaction may modulate the expression

98

of host susceptibility proteins to SARS-CoV-2 and prime the host to manifest severe respiratory illness

following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods:

104

Animal husbandry, experimental design and ozone exposure: Seven-week-old C57BL/6 mice were

105

procured from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were maintained in individually ventilated, hot-

106

washed cages on a 12-hour dark/light cycle. Mice were housed in polycarbonate cages and fed a regular

107

diet and water ad libitum. All animal use procedures were performed after approval from the Institutional

108

Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Louisiana State University. Ozone was generated by

109

ozone generator (TSE Systems, Chesterfield, MO), and the ozone levels were monitored by UV photometric

110

ozone analyzer (Envia Altech Environment, Geneva, IL). Data acquisition was done through DACO

111

monitoring software (TSE Systems, Chesterfield, MO). Control mice were kept in chamber supplied by

112

filtered air (Air). Animals were exposed to ozone (800ppb; 4h/night, 5 nights/week, for 3 weeks) or air.

113

Further details have been published previously 1.

114
115

Necropsy and tissue harvesting, micro-dissection of the extrapulmonary airways, the parenchyma,

116

and Purification of airspace macrophages: Animals were euthanized and tissues were collected for RNA

117

isolation or histological analyses, as described previously 1.

118
119

Immunohistochemistry for TMPRSS2: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded 5µm lung sections were used

120

for immunohistochemical localization of TMPRSS2. Sections were deparaffinized with Xylene and

121

rehydrated with graded ethanol. Heat-induced antigen-retrieval was performed using a Citrate buffer (pH

122

6.0). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide (10 min at room temperature).

123

After blocking with 3% goat serum for 30 min, sections were incubated for 2h at room temperature with

124

rabbit polyclonal TMPRSS2 primary antibody (ab214462; Abcam Cambridge, MA). The sections were

125

then processed using VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed

126

by chromogenic substrate conversion to insoluble colored precipitate using ImmPACT NovaRED HRP

127

substrate Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were counterstained with Gill’s

128

Hematoxylin-I, dehydrated, and coverslipped with mounting media (H-5000, Vector Laboratories,

129

Burlingame, CA).

130
131

Western Blotting for TMPRSS2: Whole lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage aliquots were

132

separated by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gradient gel; Life Technologies, CA) and transferred

133

to PVDF membrane. Rabbit polyclonal TMPRSS2 primary antibody (ab214462; Abcam Cambridge, MA)

134

and mouse monoclonal alpha tubulin (T5168, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) were used. Protein bands were

135

visualized using secondary antibodies (alexa fluor 680 Goat anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa fluor 800 Goat anti-

136

mouse IgG) and acquired using Odyssey CLx, Imager (LI-COR, NE) 2.

Results and discussion:

172

TMPRSS2 is essential for the proteolytic priming of viral spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2

173

following its binding to host receptor, ACE2. In fact, a recent study elegantly demonstrated that host cell

174

entry of SARS-CoV-2 can be blocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of TMPRSS2 indicating the critical

175

importance of TMPRSS2 in determining SARS-CoV-2 infectivity 2. Therefore, the host susceptibility to

176

SARS-CoV-2 could vary based on the expression of the host susceptibility proteins including ACE2 and

177

TMPRSS2

178

factors including air pollution

179

mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 22-24. While it is already known that the unhealthy levels of ozone, one of the

180

6 criteria air pollutants, increase the risk for developing cardiopulmonary health problems 14-20, it is unclear

181

whether the ambient ozone regulates the levels of expression of host susceptibility proteins to SARS-CoV-

182

2 and in turn accounts, in part, for the varied susceptibilities of human population to SARS-CoV-

183

2.Therefore, we sought to test the hypothesis that ozone induces the expression of TMPRSS2 in lung tissue.

184

As compared to filtered air-exposed mice, the ozone-exposed mice had significantly elevated levels

185

of TMPRSS2 protein in the whole lung lysate (Fig 1A) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (Fig

186

1B). These results demonstrate that ozone exposure increases the expression of TMPRSS2 protein in the

187

lungs of mice and that this protein is detectable in the BALF fluid. Next, we performed

188

immunohistochemical staining on lung sections to visualize cell-specific localization of TMPRSS2.

189

Interestingly, while the TMPRSS2 staining was evident in the airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages

190

from filtered air-exposed mice, the staining intensity was remarkably increased in the airway epithelial

191

cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages from ozone-exposed mice (Fig 1C). These results

192

clearly demonstrate that ozone increases the expression of TMPRSS2 in the lung tissue in a cell-specific

193

manner.

3-5

. Individuals have varied susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 that may be dependent on various
10, 11

. Air-pollution levels correlate strongly with increased morbidity and

194

In order to test whether TMPRSS2 protein expression correlates with mRNA expression in a cell-

195

specific manner, we analyzed RNASeq dataset from extrapulmonary airways (Fig. 2A), parenchyma (Fig.

196

2B), and alveolar macrophages from filtered-air and ozone exposed mice (Fig. 2C) for Tmprss2 transcript

197

levels. As expected, the fragment per kilo base per million mapped reads (FPKM) for Tmprss2 were

198

significantly upregulated in all the three tissue compartments in ozone-exposed as compared to filtered-air

199

exposed mice. We further confirmed these findings for cell-specificity in ozone-exposed airways and

200

alveoli using RNAscope-based in situ hybridization. This assay also showed significantly increased signals

201

for Tmprss2 transcripts in both the airway epithelial cells and the alveolar epithelial cells of ozone-exposed

202

compared to filtered-air exposed mice (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that the changes in the protein levels

203

of TMPRSS2 are a result of changes at the level of gene expression indicating that ozone directly or

204

indirectly differentially regulates the gene expression of Tmprss2.

205

Finally, from the RNASeq data, we compared the normalized z-scores of 32 known genes

206

associated with host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Of the three tissues analyzed, while only four of the

207

total 32 genes, i.e., Furin, Thop1, Ppia, and Tmprss2, were significantly increased in the extrapulmonary

208

airways of ozone-exposed versus filtered-air exposed mice (Fig. 3A); in the lung parenchyma, nearly half

209

of the host susceptibility genes were upregulated while the rest half were downregulated in ozone-exposed

210

versus filtered-air exposed mice (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the extrapulmonary airways and the lung

211

parenchyma, a major proportion of the host susceptibility genes including those of Tmprss2, Ace, Anpep,

212

Cd4, and Ccr5 were significantly upregulated in the CD11b- lung macrophages from ozone-exposed versus

213

filtered-air exposed mice (Fig. 3C) indicating a large effect of ozone-exposure on SARS-CoV-2 host

214

susceptibility genes in CD11b- lung macrophages

215

In conclusion, this study suggests a critical role of the host-environment (ozone pollution)

216

interaction in modulating the susceptibility of the human population to SARS-CoV-2. Since TMPRSS2 is

217

essential for the proteolytic processing of several coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1, MERS, as well as

218

influenza A virus

219

this study presents a novel finding that will have significant and immediate impact on our understanding of

220

the pathogenesis and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Figure Legends:

358 Figure 1. TMPRSS2 protein expression is upregulated in the lungs of ozone exposed mice: (A) Western
359 blot analyses [Bar Graph (above), and representative gel image (below) showing bands for TMPRSS2 protein
360 and Tubulin loading control] on the whole lung homogenate from Air- and Ozone-exposed mice (n=6-8). (B)
361 Western blot analyses [Bar Graph (above), and representative gel image (below) showing bands for TMPRSS2
362 protein] on the equal volumes (loading control) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from Air- and Ozone-exposed
363 mice (n=5). The data are expressed as means (±SEM). Student’s T-Test **** P<0.0001. (C)
364 Immunohistochemical staining for TMPRSS2 in macrophages (solid red arrow), alveolar epithelial cells (solid
365 green arrow), and bronchiolar epithelial cells (solid Purple arrow). Negatively stained cells are indicated by
366 dotted arrows in lung sections that were incubated with antibody (IgG) control. All images were captured at
367 the same magnification.
368 Figure 2. Tmprss2 mRNA expression is upregulated in the lungs of ozone exposed mice: FPKM values
369 obtained from RNAseq data set obtained from airways (A), parenchyma (B), and alveolar macrophages (C)
370 were used to quantify relative expression levels of Tmprss2 mRNA in air- versus ozone-exposed mice (n=8).
371 The data are expressed as means (±SEM). Student’s T-Test **** P<0.0001. (D) RNAscope-based in situ
372 hybridization for Tmprss2 transcripts (green dots representing punctate staining for Tmprss2 mRNA in airway
373 epithelial cells (Top) and alveolar epithelial cells (bottom) in air- (left) and ozone-exposed (right) mice. All
374 images were captured at the same magnification.
