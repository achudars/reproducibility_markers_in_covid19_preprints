ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 65 million
individuals and killed over 1.5 million persons (December 8, 2020; www.who.int)1. While
fatality rates are higher among the elderly and those with underlying comorbidities2, host
factors that promote susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease are
poorly

understood.

Although

individuals

with

certain

autoimmune/inflammatory

disorders show increased susceptibility to viral infections, there is incomplete
knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility in these diseases.3-7 We report that the
autoimmune PTPN2 risk variant rs1893217 promotes expression of the SARS-CoV-2
receptor, ACE2, and increases cellular entry mediated by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
Elevated ACE2 expression and viral entry were mediated by increased JAK-STAT
signalling, and were reversed by the JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib. Collectively, our findings
uncover a novel risk biomarker for increased expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor
and viral entry, and identify a clinically approved therapeutic agent to mitigate this risk.
Despite tremendous effort to understand COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for severe
disease are still poorly defined. While most attention has focused on symptoms in the airways,
gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were reported in 46% of all cases and 33% presented with GI
symptoms in the absence of respiratory symptoms.8,9 GI symptoms are associated with longer
duration and more severe COVID-19 (e.g. increased prevalence of acute renal insufficiency10),
emphasizing their importance for early diagnosis and prognosis.11 SARS-CoV-2 can directly
infect intestinal epithelial cells,12,13 and viral particles have been detected in feces even after
virus clearance from the respiratory tract14,15. This indicates viral shedding in the gut, which may
serve as a reservoir of virus replication, and possible oral-fecal transmission although presence
of live virus in feces is disputed.12,16
SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by its spike glycoprotein (S protein), which is
cleaved by cell surface-associated transmembrane protease serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and
TMPRSS4 to generate the S1 and S2 subunits in a so-called ‘priming’ process.16,17 S1 binds to
angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a monocarboxypeptidase controlling cleavage of
several peptides within the renin-angiotensin system.16,17 S2 drives the subsequent fusion of
viral and host membranes.18 Interferon (IFN)-JAK-STAT signaling is a suggested major driver of
ACE2 expression likely via STAT1/3 binding sites in the ACE2 promoter19. ACE2, TMPRSS2,
and TMPRSS4 are highly expressed on the surface of epithelial cells such as lung type 2
pneumocytes and absorptive intestinal epithelial cells.12,18-21

About 16-20% of the general population carries the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs1893217 located in the gene locus encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2
(PTPN2, also called TCPTP)22,23. This SNP causes PTPN2 loss of function and is associated
with increased risk for chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD), Type 1 diabetes (T1D), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).24,25 PTPN2 directly
dephosphorylates several transducers of cytokine receptor signaling including the STAT family
of transcription factors (STATs 1/3/5/6)) and Janus kinases (JAK)1 and JAK 3 that are activated
by inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ.26-28 JAK inhibitors have emerged as an effective new
therapeutic class in many patients with autoimmune diseases. Indeed a JAK-inhibitor,
baricitinib, is in clinical trial (ACTT-2) to reduce disease severity and hospitalization time in
COVID-1929. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) is a pan-JAK inhibitor that preferentially inhibits JAK1 and
JAK3, is approved to treat RA and the IBD subtype, ulcerative colitis (UC), and we have shown
that tofacitinib corrects the consequences of PTPN2-loss in IECs30.
Using intestinal samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from IBD patients
harbouring the autoimmune PTPN2 risk variant rs1893217, human intestinal and lung epithelial
cell lines as well as Ptpn2-deficient mouse models, we determined that PTPN2-loss promotes
ACE2 expression and entry of viral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 spikes. Elevated ACE2
expression and viral entry were mediated by increased epithelial JAK-STAT signalling, and were
reversed by the clinically-approved JAK inhibitor, Tofacitinib. Collectively, our findings not only
describe a risk factor for increased SARS-CoV-2 invasion (entry), but also identify a clinically
approved drug that may be utilized to mitigate this risk31.

Results
PTPN2 regulates ACE2 expression in vivo and in vitro
Mucosal biopsy samples from IBD patients in the Swiss IBD cohort previously genotyped for the
IBD-associated loss-of-function SNP rs1893217 in PTPN232 were subjected to RNA
sequencing. Using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID), gene ontogeny (GO) biological pathway analysis indicated “Digestion” as the most
significantly regulated function based on PTPN2 genotype (presence of risk ‘C’ allele, patients
with the CT or the CC genotype) independent of disease severity (Supplementary Table 1). This
biological process included the ACE2 gene, which was also found in three other processes that
were increased in ‘C’ allele carriers (Supplementary Table 1). Quantitative PCR and Western
blotting on intestinal biopsies isolated from Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)
patients (Supplementary Table 2) confirmed increased mRNA and protein expression of ACE2
in C-allele carriers (Figure 1A+B). Furthermore ACE2 protein expression negatively correlated
with PTPN2 phosphatase activity (Figure 1C). To confirm these findings in Ptpn2-knockout (KO)
mice, which exhibit a severe inflammatory phenotype and die within few weeks after birth33, we
explored ACE2 expression in 3-week-old mice when the intestinal epithelium appears relatively
normal compared to heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) littermates. Although Ptpn2-KO
mice did not exhibit any difference in Ace2 mRNA expression in whole intestinal samples
compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Supplementary Figure 1A), Ace2 mRNA and protein
expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) from these mice was significantly increased
(Supplementary Figure 1A, Figure 1D). In addition, Ace2 mRNA expression in lung and cardiac
tissue was significantly increased in Ptpn2-KO mice (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure 1B+C).
Given the strong increase of ACE2 expression in IECs of Ptpn2-KO mice, and to explore
whether PTPN2 regulates ACE2 in the absence of inflammation, we confirmed these findings in
mice lacking PTPN2 specifically in IECs (Ptpn2∆IEC mice). Also in these mice, Ace2 mRNA and
protein expression were clearly elevated in PTPN2-deficient IECs (Figure 1E, Supplementary
Figure 1D), demonstrating that the increase in Ace2 expression was not dependent on
inflammation. This effect was confirmed in intestinal epithelial, lung epithelial and monocyte cell
lines upon PTPN2 knockdown, where depletion of PTPN2 resulted in elevated ACE2 expression
(Supplementary Figure 1E).28 Notably, the serine proteases TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, which
are additional cofactors of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, were not altered in PTPN2 knockdown
(PTPN2-KD) cells (Supplementary Figure 2). This suggests that PTPN2 specifically regulates
ACE2 expression.

PTPN2 negatively regulates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated viral entry into epithelial
and immune cells
To assess the functional consequence of increased ACE2 expression in PTPN2-deficient cells,
we assessed whether deletion of PTPN2 affects the uptake of virus-like particles (VLPs)
expressing SARS-CoV-2 spikes. Apical uptake of empty VLPs (-), which served as a negative
control, or uptake of VLPs covered with spike G glycoprotein of the rhabdovirus vesicular
stomatitis virus (G), which served as a positive control for viral entry, was not affected in
PTPN2-KD Caco-2BBe (Figure 2A) and HT-29.cl19A IECs (Figure 2B) or A549 lung epithelial
cells (Figure 2C), thus indicating that non-specific uptake was not affected upon PTPN2
knockdown. In contrast, VLPs expressing SARS CoV-2 spikes entered PTPN2-KD epithelial
cells more efficiently than control cells (Figure 2A-C), indicating that PTPN2 deficiency not only
promotes ACE2 expression but also viral uptake into intestinal and lung epithelial cells. Notably,
loss of PTPN2 also caused a significant increase in ACE2 expression in PTPN2-KD monocytes
(Supplementary Figure 1) and increased CoVS entry (Figure 2D). This indicates that PTPN2
regulation of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing VLP entry is not restricted to epithelial
cells but has similar functional consequences in immune cells. Furthermore, increased uptake of
SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing VLPs in PTPN2-deficient cells was no longer observed upon
inhibition of ACE2 with a blocking antibody (Supplementary Figure 3), indicating that ACE2
mediated SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing VLP uptake. In summary, this indicates that loss of
PTPN2 promotes SARS-CoV-2 uptake by promoting ACE2 expression.
IFN-γ promotes ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein uptake
It has been suggested that ACE2 expression is induced by interferons34 and its promoter is
reported to have putative STAT1 binding sites19,35, although newer findings debate whether
interferons can induce ACE2 expression, or if it drives expression and release of a shorter
version of the protein36. Since PTPN2 is a potent suppressor of IFN-γ-induced signaling
cascades27,37, and directly dephosphorylates STAT138, we assessed whether IFN-γ treatment
promotes ACE2 expression in our cell culture models. Indeed, IFN-γ promoted ACE2 expression
and this was further increased in PTPN2-KD cells (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 4).
Silencing of STAT1 using siRNA constructs prevented IFN-γ-induced ACE2 mRNA and protein
expression and STAT1-siRNA treated PTPN2-KD Caco-2BBe, A549 and THP-1 cells expressed
ACE2 levels comparable to those in Ctr cells (Figure 3B+C and Supplementary Figure 5). In line
with these effects on ACE2 expression, uptake of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-expressing VLPs was
elevated in IFN-γ-treated control and PTPN2-KD cells, while STAT1 silencing normalized the

uptake, both in Ctr cells and PTPN2-KD cells (Figure 3D+E, Supplementary Figure 5). This
strongly suggests that deletion of PTPN2 promotes ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 entry in
a STAT1-dependent manner and inhibition of STAT signaling may mitigate elevated ACE2
expression and SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.
Tofacitnib reverses ACE2 overexpression and increased SARS-CoV-2 entry in PTPN2deficient human cells and mice
To test whether inhibition of STAT activation can indeed prevent elevated ACE2 expression in
PTPN2-deficient cells, we next treated Caco-2BBe IECs with the pan-JAK-inhibitor tofacitinib.
Similar to our findings in cells treated with STAT1 siRNA, inhibition of JAK-STAT signalling in
Caco-2BBe cells using tofacitinib prevented IFN-γ-induced increases in ACE2 mRNA and
protein expression and normalized the elevated ACE2 levels in PTPN2-KD cells (Figure 4A+B).
Moreover, tofacitinib reduced ACE2-mediated SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing VLP uptake in
both PTPN2-KD and in IFN-γ-treated cells (Figure 4C). Similar effects were observed in A549
lung epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure 6), indicating that tofacitinib treatment might not only
reduce ACE2-mediated intestinal viral uptake, but also reduce viral uptake in the respiratory
tract, the primary entry site of SARS-CoV-2. We next tested if tofacitinib altered ACE2 levels in
human subjects. Levels of soluble ACE2, which has been suggested to reduce viral binding to
host cells39, were not altered in UC patients treated with tofacitinib when compared to UC
patients under anti-TNF treatment with similar disease activity (Figure 4D, Supplementary Table
3). This suggests that tofacitinib treatment does not reduce shedding/release of ACE2 into
serum. In contrast, when analysing ACE2 levels in PBMCs from IBD patients carrying the
PTPN2 loss-of-function SNP rs1893217, we again observed that ACE2 mRNA and protein
levels and SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing VLP entry were clearly elevated in variant carriers
compared to non-carriers (Figure 4E-G). Notably, treatment with tofacitinib not only reduced
ACE2 levels and viral entry in variant carriers, but also in non-carriers (Figure 4E-G). These
findings indicate that loss of PTPN2 or presence of the loss-of-function variant in PTPN2
promotes ACE2 expression and subsequently facilitates uptake of SARS-CoV-2-spikeexpressing VLPs, and that treatment with tofacitinib can mitigate this potential risk by reducing
ACE2 cellular expression rather than affecting release of soluble ACE2. Furthermore, our data
strongly indicate that treatment with tofacitinib might not only be beneficial in PTPN2 variant
carriers, but also for non-carriers.

Our data consistently demonstrate that PTPN2 dysfunction promotes expression of ACE2 and
uptake of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and this is further increased by inflammation. This is
striking given a recent paper identifying that non-genotyped IBD patients (+/- inflammation)
showed no change in ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression, while experimental colitis in mice
reduced gut epithelial Ace2 expression.40 This indicates that inflammation does not promote
ACE2 expression per se, but that the elevated ACE2 levels in patients or mice with reduced
PTPN2 activity are indeed due to PTPN2 deficiency.
Summarized, we demonstrate that SNP rs1893217 in PTPN2 is associated with increased
expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 entry, and potentially represents one of the first identified
COVID-19 genetic susceptibility biomarkers. By using samples collected well before the COVID19 outbreak, our identification of a genetic susceptibility marker avoids the potential for
ascertainment bias in most genetic studies of COVID-19, as clinically significant COVID-19
patients are more likely to be included in research projects than asymptomatic cases41. With
respect to genetic markers of COVID-19 susceptibility, studies have proposed the involvement
of ABO blood groups, with blood group O associated with lower risk, while blood group A was
associated with higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups41-44.
However, this correlation did not culminate in therapeutic implications. Moreover, a cluster of
genes on chromosome 3 has been linked with increased severity, although this may have
distinct geographic distributions41,45. In contrast, our finding of increased ACE2 expression/viral
particle uptake in PTPN2 variant cells might not only indicate a potentially novel genetic marker
for increased disease, but also identifies tofacitinib – a drug already approved for treatment of
arthritis and IBD – and potentially other JAK inhibitors such as baricitinib, as a potential
therapeutic strategy to specifically mitigate this risk.

Methods
Patient samples. Samples from IBD patients used for RNA and protein isolation were obtained
from the Swiss IBD cohort and the sample use approved by the local ethic’s board (Ethic’s
board of the Kanton Zurich, Switzerland; approval number EK1977). Serum samples were
obtained from University of California San Diego under IRB Protocol # 131487. All patients
provided informed consent.
Mice. PTPN2-knock-out (KO) mice in the BALB/c background were a gift from Prof. M.
Tremblay at McGill University in Montreal. To generate mice lacking PTPN2 specifically in
intestinal epithelial cells (ΔIEC mice), mice with a loxP-flanked exon 3 of the PTPN2 gene
(PTPN2-fl/fl mice, originally obtained from EUCOMM, abbreviated as fl/fl) were crossed with
VillinCre-ERT2 mice (Jackson Laboratories). Translocation of the Cre-ERT2 construct and
subsequent recombination and deletion of the floxed gene was induced by tamoxifen-injections
(i.p., 1mg/mouse/day) on 5 consecutive days. All mouse experiments were conducted according
to protocols approved by the IACUC commission of the University of California Riverside
(AUP20190032).
Protein isolation and Western blotting. Protein isolation and Western blotting were performed
according to standard procedures. For protein isolation from cells, the cells were washed with
ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Roche,
South San Francisco, CA). For mouse and human biopsies, the samples were dissociated in
RIPA buffer using a bead-beater and metal beads. All samples were then sonicated for 30
seconds, centrifuged (10 min. at 12’000 g at 4°C), and the supernatant transferred into fresh
tubes. Protein concentration was detected using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). For Western blots, aliquots with equal amounts of protein were separated by
electrophorese on polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins blotted on nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were then blocked in blocking buffer (3% milk, 1% BSA in tris-buffered saline
with 0.5% Tween) for 1 h and incubated over night at 4°C with anti-ACE2 (Clone E-11, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701, clone 58D6; Cell Signalling Technologies,
Danvers, MA), anti-STAT1 (clone 42H3; Cell Signalling Technologies), or anti-β-actin (Clone
AC-74, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) antibodies. On the next day, the membranes were
washed in tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween, incubated with HRP-coupled secondary
antibodies (Jackson Immunolabs, West Grove, PA), washed again, and immunoreactive

proteins detected using ELC substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and X-ray films (GE
Healthcare, Chicago, IL).
PTPN2 phosphatase assay. For PTPN2 activity measurements, 100 µg protein lysates were
pre-cleared for 1 h using Sepharose A beads, incubated with 2 µl anti-PTPN2 antibody (Clone
D7T7D, Cell Signaling Technologies) over night, incubated with Sepharose A beads for 1 h and
centrifuged (3 min. at 12’000 g at 4°C). The precipitates were washed 3 times with ice cold PBS
and the beads resuspended in phosphatase assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
phosphatase activity measured using the EnzCheck Phosphatase assay (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
RNA isolation and qPCR. For RNA isolation, biopsies were disrupted in RLT buffer (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) using a bead beater and metal beads. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS
before lysis in RLT buffer. All samples were then passed 3-5 times through a 26G needle prior
to RNA isolation using the RNAeasy mini kit from Qiagen. RNA concentrations were estimated
by absorbance measurement at 260 and 280 nm, and cDNA generated using the qScript
reverse transcriptase (Quantabio, Beverly MA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed
using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) on a C1000 Thermal cycler equipped
with a CFX96 Real-Time PCR system using BioRad CFX Manager 3.1 Software. Measurements
were performed in triplicates using GAPDH as an endogenous control. Results were analyzed
by the ΔΔCT method. The real-time PCR included an initial enzyme activation step (3 minutes,
95 °C) followed by 45 cycles consisting of a denaturing (95 °C, 10 seconds), an annealing (53°60°C, 10 seconds) and an extending (72 °C, 10 seconds) step. The used primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S3.
VLPs and measurement of VLP uptake.

To produce pseudoparticles, 293T cells were

transfected with plasmids encoding a minimal HIV (pTRIP, CSGW, CSPW) provirus expressing
the Gaussia Luciferase (Gluc), gag-pol, and S protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus using
polyethylenimine (PEI) transfection reagent46-48. Supernatants were collected at 24, 48 and 72
hours post-transfection, pooled, filtered (0.45 mm), aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
Pseudoparticle infections were performed in the presence of 4 µg/ml polybrene. Appropriate
amounts of pseudoparticle were added onto target cells and plates incubated for 3 hrs (37°C)
before changing media. Gaussian luciferase was measured at 24, 48, and 72 hrs after infection.

To measure VLP uptake into cells, the VLP-containing medium was diluted 1:2 in cell culture
medium and applied to the cells. After 1 h, the cells were washed with PBS and fresh medium
added to the cells. In experiments with IFN-γ (1000 IU/ml; Roche, Belmont CA), the replacement
medium for cells infected in presence of IFN-γ contained IFN-γ as well. To determine VLP
uptake, luciferase luminescence in cell culture supernatant was determined using the Renilla
luciferase activity assay from Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Cell culture, PTPN2 knockdown, siRNA treatment and IFN-γ treatment. HT-29.cl19A were
obtained from Kim E. Barrett (University of California, San Diego, California), Caco-2BBe, A549
and THP-1 cells were originally obtained from ATCC and cultured according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation in medium with 10% FCS. For PTPN2 knockdown, the cells
were infected with lentiviral particles containing non-targeting control shRNA (Ctr) or PTPN2specfic shRNA as described previously49 and stable clones selected using puromycin. For
STAT1 silencing, the cells were transfected with previously validated, STAT1-specific or nontargeting control siRNA constructs (Dharmacon) using DharmaFECT transfectionre agents as
described previously50. In experiments with STAT1 siRNA and IFN-γ treatment, the culture
medium was replaced with serum-free medium 8 h prior to addition of IFN-γ (1000 IU; Roche).
In experiments with Tofacitinib, the cells were treated with tofacitinib (50 µM, MedChemExpress,
Monmouth Junction, NJ). Control cells were treated with an equal amount of vehicle (dimethyl
sulfoxide, DMSO, 0.5%, Sigma-Aldrich).

ELISA. Human ACE2 ELISA was obtained from R&D and performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions with undiluted serum.
RNA sequencing. RNA sequencing was performed and analyzed by the Integrative Genomics
Core, City of Hope National Medical Center (Duarte USA). The RNA-seq libraries were
constructed

50 bp reads to a depth of about 35M. The sequences were aligned to human genome assembly
hg38 using Tophat2 v2.0.14. RNA-seq data quality was evaluated using RSeQC v2.5. For each
sample, expression counts for Ensembl genes (v92) were summarized by HTseq v0.6.1, and
reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) were calculated. Count
normalization and differential expression analyses between groups were conducted using
