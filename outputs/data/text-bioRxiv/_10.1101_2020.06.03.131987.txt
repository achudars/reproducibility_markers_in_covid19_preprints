Abstract
Covid-19 pandemic, caused by the sars-cov-2 strain of coronavirus, has affected
millions of people all over the world and taken thousands of lives. It is of utmost
importance that the character of this deadly virus be studied and its nature be analysed.
We present here an analysis pipeline comprising phylogenetic analysis on strains of this
novel virus to track its evolutionary history among the countries uncovering several
interesting relationships, followed by a classification exercise to identify the virulence of
the strains and extraction of important features from its genetic material that are used
subsequently to predict mutation at those interesting sites using deep learning
techniques. In a nutshell, we have prepared an analysis pipeline for hCov genome
sequences leveraging the power of machine intelligence and uncovered what remained
apparently shrouded by raw data.

1. Introduction
Covid-19 was declared a global health pandemic on March 11, 2020 [1]. It is the
biggest public health concern of this century [22]. It has already surpassed the previous
two outbreaks due to the coronavirus, namely, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (SARS-Cov) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERSCov). The virus acting behind this epidemic is known as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 or in short sars-cov-2 virus. It is a single stranded RNA virus

which is mainly 26,000 to 32,000 bases long in average [2]. The novel coronavirus is
spherical in shape and has spike protein protruding from its surface. These spikes
assimilate into human cells, then undergo a structural change that allows the viral
membrane to fuse with the cell membrane. The host cell is then attacked by the viral
gene through intrusion and it copies itself within the host cell, producing multiple new
viruses [3].
As of mid-April, 2020, about 10,000 of high-quality complete genome sequences were
present in the GISAID initiative database [23] collected from clinicians and researchers
from around the world. To understand the viral evolution and its nature of spread among
the different countries, we present an analysis pipeline of the genome sequence
leveraging the power of machine intelligence.
This paper makes the following key contributions.
A. An alignment-free phylogenetic analysis is carried out with a goal to uncover the
evolutionary history of sars-cov-2. The resulting phylogenetic tree is able to
highlight evolutionary relationships that can be explained by facts and figures and
has further identified some mysterious relationships.
B. Several Machine Learning and Deep learning models are used to identify the
virulence of the strains (i.e., to classify a virus strain as either severe or mild).
Additionally, from the classification pipeline, important features are identified as
Sites of Interest (SoIs) in the virus strains for further analysis.
C. Several CNN-RNN based models are used to predict mutations at specific Sites
of Interest (SoIs) of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence followed by further
analyses of the same on several South-Asian countries.
D. Overall, we present an analysis pipeline that can be further utilized as well as
extended and revised (a) to study where a newly discovered genome sequence
lies in relation to its predecessors in different regions of the world; (b) to analyse
its virulence with respect to the number of deaths its predecessors have caused
in their respective countries and (c) to analyse the mutation at specific important
sites of the viral genome.

2. Methods

Figure 1: The whole analysis pipeline consisted of three phases. In the first
phase, the genome sequences are divided into subsets based on country and a
phylogenetic tree is constructed considering only the “representative”
sequences of each such subset using an alignment-free sequence comparison
approach. In the second phase, we employed state of the art classification
algorithms, leveraging both traditional and deep learning pipelines to learn to
discriminate the viral strains of many countries as either mild or severe. We also
identify the features that contributed the most as the discriminant factor in the
classification pipeline. Finally, we use the identified features from the previous
stare to predict the mutation of the interesting sites in the viral strain using a
deep learning model.
Figure 1 presents our overall analysis pipeline. Below we present the details of the
pipeline.

2.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
We have collected 10179 hCov genome sequences upto the date 24 April, 2020 (cut-off
date) from the GISAID initiative dataset [23]. These are high quality complete viral
genome sequences submitted by the scientists and scientific institutes of individual
countries.
We also have collected country wise death statistics (upto cut-off date) from the official
site of WHO [6]. The label was assigned based on a threshold of deaths which is the
estimated median of the number of deaths in the data points. Any genome sequence of
a country having deaths below (above) the threshold were considered a mild (severe)
strain, i.e., assigned a label 0 (1). A sample labelling is shown in the supplementary

Table 1. Informatively, we have also considered some other metrics for labeling
purposes albeit with unsatisfactory output (please see supplementary file for details).
We divided the whole dataset into training and testing subset in 80/20 ratio with a
balanced number of data points per class for traditional machine learning pipeline and
for deep learning classification routine, we created the subsets training/validation/testing
in 68/12/20 ratio.

2.2 Identifying Representative Viral Strains

Figure 2: The Viral Genome Sequences were divided into subsets of sequences
based on country. For each subset, each Viral Genome Sequence is converted
into a vector representation and pairwise euclidean distance was calculated
among the vectors to create the distance matrix. As the matrix is very highdimensional, we used principal component analysis to find the principal
component matrix from the distance matrix. Representative sequences were
identified through K-means clustering on the PCA Matrix, and a phylogenetic tree
was constructed from the representative sequence of each country.
We aim to identify and interpret the evolutionary relationships among the hCov Genome
sequences uploaded at GISAID from different regions around the globe (Figure 2). To

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.131987; this version posted June 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

do that we have used an alignment-free genome sequence comparison method as
proposed in [5] as briefly described below. Notably, we do not consider any alignmentbased method since it is not computationally feasible for us to align thousands of viral
sequences for analysis and clustering purposes [4].
At first the sequence set is divided into subsets of sequences based on the location. All
sequences are converted into representative ℝ18 vector. Pairwise distance among
vectors derived from the fast vector method [5] are computed using Euclidean distance.
Due to the high dimensionality of the resulting distance matrix, we resort to Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) technique [9] to reduce the dimension of the matrix.
Subsequently, we use K-means clustering [43] to identify the corresponding cluster
centers. For the K-means clustering algorithm, we have used the implementation of
[38] and used the default parameters except for the number of clusters which were set
to 1 for determining the cluster center for each of the subsets. For each location-based
cluster, the representative sequence (i.e., the “centroid” of the cluster) is then identified
and used in the subsequent step of the pipeline.

2.3 Phylogeny Estimation
The evolutionary relationship among the representative sequences of different clusters
(from Section 2.2) has been estimated by constructing a phylogenetic tree. We have
used the Neighbor Joining algorithm [37] for phylogenetic tree construction since it is
more reliable [25]. We have used Euclidean distance among the vectors, as described
in the Section 2.2, to prepare the distance matrix.
While we predominantly have used the alignment-free method of [5], in this stage, we
have only 67 representative sequences and hence we have also attempted a few other
alignment-free and alignment-based methods to estimate the phylogenetic tree;
however, these didn’t produce satisfactory results (more details are in supplementary
file).

2.4 Classification Models

Figure 3: This figure illustrates our classification pipelines. We have leveraged the
potential of both traditional and deep learning pipelines and in addition to doing an
interesting classification task (mild vs. severe) we aim to identify, more importantly, the
(sequence based) features and hence the corresponding sites of the the viral genome
that are performing as the most discriminant feature with respect to classification.

Figure 3 illustrates our overall classification pipeline. We describe each stage in detail in
the following subsections.

Traditional Machine Learning Pipeline:
For traditional machine learning, we use a pipeline similar to [12] (See Figure 3 in
Supplementary file). We extracted three types of features from the genomic sequence
of novel sars-cov-2. Inspired by the recent works [12][14][64][65] that focus only on
sequences, we also extract only sequence-based features. These features are: position
independent features, n-gapped dinucleotides and position specific features (see details
in Section 3 of supplementary file). We use the gini value of the Extremely Randomized
Tree (Extra Tree) classifier [13] to rank the features. Subsequently, only the features
with gini value greater than the mean of the gini values are selected for training a
LightGBM classifier model [15] (with default parameters) and performed 10-fold cross

validation. LightGBM is a highly efficient and fast gradient boosting framework which
uses tree-based algorithms.

Important feature identification:
We use SHAP values and Univariate feature selection to compare the importance of the
features. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach which is
used to explain the output of a model [44]. Univariate feature selection works by
selecting the best features based on univariate statistical tests [50]. We use
SelectKBest univariate feature selection to get the top K highest scoring features
according to ANOVA f_classif feature scoring [56] function.

Deep Learning Models:
We leverage the power of 3 different deep learning (DL) classification models, namely,
vanilla CNN [7], AlexNet [40] and InceptionNet [41]. We transform the raw viral genome
sequences into two different representations, namely, K-mers spectral representation
[7] and one hot vectorization [8] to feed those into the DL networks in a seamless
manner. Details of these representations are given in Section 5.2 of the Supplementary
File. For K-mers spectral representation we experimented with different values of K (K =
3,5,7 for Vanila CNN and K = 3 & 5 only for the rest due to resource limitation). For one
hot vectorization, we have trained InceptionNet for 150 epochs for both 3- and 5-mers
and trained AlexNet for 135, 100 and 100 epochs for 3-,4- and 5-mers respectively.

2.5 Mutation Prediction

Figure 4: The interesting sites were selected from the viral genome sequences
using the feature selection routine described in the classification methods. The
sites were then divided by geographical locations and clustered by the time of the
first occurrence at that respective region. Time-series sequences were created by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.131987; this version posted June 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

concatenating random strains from the closest sub-clusters and trained in an
CNN-RNN network for predicting mutation in the sites of the final time-step.
We design a pipeline to predict mutation on specific sites (chosen in an earlier stage of
the pipeline) in the sars-cov-2 genome (Figure 4). We follow a similar protocol followed
by [10] and adopt it to fit our setting as follows. We divide all the available countries and
the states of the USA into different time-steps by the date of the first reported incidence
of sars-cov-2 infected patients of that location. Thus, every resulting time-step
represents a date (Tk for Cluster k) and contains the clusters of genome sequences of
the countries/states. Then the time series samples are generated by concatenating sites
from different time-step one-by-one that represent the evolutionary path of the sars-cov2 viral strain. For example, T1 is the very first date when the virus is discovered in
China. So, the time-step 1 contains only one country, China. Likewise, time-step T2
contains clusters for those countries where the virus is discovered on date T2 and so on.
(Check Table 3 in supplementary file for more details).
We generate 300000 time series sequences by concatenating genome sites from
T1,T2,....,Tn (in our case, n = 40) and then fed the samples to the model which consists
of a convolutional one dimensional layer and a recurrent neural network layer [34]. We
experiment with both pure LSTM and bidirectional LSTM as our RNN layer (see section
4.3 of supplementary file). The model has a dense layer of 4 neurons in the end which
predicts the probability of the next base pair of the next time-step. So, in a nut-shell the
model takes concatenated genome sequences from T1,T2,....,Tn-1 as input and predicts
the mutation for time Tn.
We further use our mutation prediction pipeline to identify and analyze possible parents
of a mutated strain. For this particular analysis, we trained the models specifically for
some South-Asian countries, namely, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. We only used
the best performing model for this analysis and generated five time series samples. At
the time of generating these samples, the country/location having the minimal euclidean
distance was taken for each time-step.

2.6 Coding and Experimental Environment
We have implemented our experiments mostly in python. We have used scikit-learn
library [38] for clustering and plotting the graphs. For deep learning models, scikit-learn,
tensorflow and keras neural network libraries are used and for LightGBM classifier,
python LightGBM framework has been used. The phylogenetic trees are constructed
using the Dendropy library of python [57] keeping default parameters. We use the tree
visualizer tools Dendroscope [11] and Evolview [24] for tree visualization and
annotation. The experiments have been conducted in the following machines:
a) Clustering and phylogenetic analyses have been carried out in a machine with
Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz, Ubuntu 19.04 OS and 8 GB RAM.
b) Experiments involving the deep learning pipelines (i.e., both classification and
mutation prediction) have been conducted in the work-stations of Galileo Cloud
Computing Platform [35] and the default GPU provided by the Google
Colaboratory Cloud Computing Platform [36].
c) The LightGBM classifier model was trained in a machine with Intel Core i5-4010U
CPU @ 1.70GHz x 4, Windows 10 OS and 16 GB RAM.
All the codes and data (except for the Genome Sequences) of our pipeline can be found
at the following link: https://github.com/pythonLoader/Analyzing-hCov-GenomeSequence.
The Genome Sequence data have been extracted from and are publicly available at
GISAID [23].

3. Results:
Evolutionary Relationship of the virus strains:
We identify the representative sequence of each of the 67 countries as present in the
GISAID dataset (upto cut-off date). The estimated phylogenetic tree constructed from
the representative sequences is shown in Figure 5. In what follows, we will be referring
to this tree as the SC2 (sars-cov-2) Tree.

Figure 5: The estimated phylogenetic tree of all the representative sequences
(i.e., SC2 Tree). The representative sequence identified in the previous steps for
each country were used in phylogeny estimation. In total 67 representative
sequences from 67 countries were taken.
The phylogenetic tree generated is expected to reveal the evolutionary relationship of
the viral strains. However, with careful scrutiny we have some apparently unusual but
interesting observations. For example, it is generally expected that the countries sharing
(open) borders (e.g., countries in Europe) should be either neighbours or at least in the
same clade in the tree. However, surprisingly from the tree, we do not notice
geographically adjacent countries in Europe as neighbors; rather we see for example
that China and Italy are immediate neighbors. It is to be noted that these two countries

are also the first countries to get hit by the first pandemic wave. In addition to that,
although the USA and Canada share the longest un-militarized international border in
the world, representative strains do not appear to be sister branches as they should
have been. Also, we notice that the USA, UK, Canada, Turkey and Russia are in the
same clade which have a higher number of deaths than most of the other countries.

Mild/Severe Strain Classification:
All our classifiers are trained to learn whether a given strain is mild or severe. The
classification accuracy of the LightGBM classifier (~91%) is superior to that of the deep
learning classifiers (~84-89%), which, while is somewhat surprising, is in line with the
recent findings of [12]. It should be noted that LightGBM had produced better results in
significantly less time than deep learning models for this dataset. The results of the
classifier models are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6: The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (ROC) show the
diagnostic capability of the ML and the DL classifiers used in our experiments. In
the first figure (top-left), we have shown the ROC curves of the best performing
models used to classify the genome sequences, in the second figure we have
shown the Precision-Recall curve of the same. The third figure shows the F1scores. Please refer to Table 5 and Figure 4 of the supplementary file for detailed
results.

Quantitative results aside, we also have applied our classifiers on the sequences that
have been deposited at GISAID after the cut-off date (i.e. April 18, 2020). Since the cutoff date, the country wise death statistics [6] has certainly changed significantly and this
has pushed a few countries, particularly from Asian regions and several states of the
United States of America transition from mild to severe state (based on our predefined
threshold). Interesting, our classifiers have been able to predict the severity of the new
strains submitted from these countries/states correctly. Table 6 in the supplementary file
shows a snapshot of a few such countries/states with the relevant information.

Sites of Interest (SoI):
We preliminarily identify the top 10 features of SHAP and SelectKBest feature selection
(with K=10). From these features, as SoIs, we have selected the features that are also
biologically significant, i.e., cover different significant gene expression regions (Figure
7). In particular, we have selected the position specific features pos_8445_8449,
pos_19610_19614, pos_24065_24069 and pos_23825_23829 as the SoIs for the
mutation prediction analyses down the pipeline. Here, pos_X_Y indicates the site from
Positions X to Y of the virus strains. The reason for selecting these features as SoIs are
outlined below.

Figure 7: Top 10 features based on SHAP values and SelectKBest and identifying
the position specific feature(s) from the genome sequence as site(s) of interest.
These SOIs will be used for mutation prediction down the pipeline.
According to gene expression studies [62][63], our SoIs, namely, pos_8445_8449 and
pos_19610_19614 encode to two Non-structural Proteins, Nsp3 and Nsp11,
respectively. And, our other two SoIs, namely, pos_24065_24069 and
pos_23825_23829 correspond to the Spike Protein of sars-cov-2. Nsp3 binds to viral
RNA, nucleocapsid protein, as well as other viral proteins, and participates in
polyprotein processing. It is an essential component of the replication/transcription

complex [51]. So, the mutation in this protein is expected to affect the replication
process of the sars-cov-2 in host bodies. On the other hand, the spike protein sticks out
from the envelope of the virion and plays a pivotal role in the receptor host selectivity
and cellular attachment. According to Wan et al. there exists strong scientific evidence
that SARS and sars-cov-2 spike proteins interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) [52]. The mutation on this protein is expected to have a significant impact on the
human to human transmission [53]. Therefore, it is certainly interesting and useful to
predict the mutation of such SoIs.

Mutation Prediction Results:
CNN-LSTM and CNN-bidirectional LSTM performed in a similar manner for different
SoIs of the genome registering 94.98% and 95% accuracy, respectively, considering all
SoIs together. For detailed results please check Table 7 and Table 8 of the
supplementary material.

Analyzing Parent Strains:
For the model involving only Bangladesh, we applied the CNN-bidirectional LSTM
model (as this is the best performer among the two) and achieved almost 100%
accuracy. Then we analyzed the ancestors in the time series test samples and noticed
that some of the states of the USA are present in these samples. These states are
California, Massachusetts, Texas, New Jersey and Maryland.
For India and Pakistan, we got similar results for some sites but for other sites, accuracy
was not as high as Bangladesh (Check Table 9 of the supplementary file for details).

4. Discussion
Evolutionary Relationships among the Virus Strains:
Our analyses reveal a very close (evolutionary) relationship between the
genome sequences of China and Italy. Also, similarity was found among
the virus strains of the USA, Germany, Qatar and Poland. These countries
have similar numbers of deaths and although not geographically directly
adjacent (except for Germany and Poland) they have strong air connectivity
among them. In fact, a number of interesting relationships can be inferred
from the estimated phylogenetic tree as follows.

1. The Italian strain of the virus is believed to be transmitted from China via two
Chinese tourists [26]. This relationship is clearly portrayed in the SC2 tree where
the two strains appear to be immediate siblings.
2. Poland’s strain is in the same clade as that of Germany, which can be explained
by the fact that its strain (through Poland’s Patient Zero) came from Germany
[27].
3. Taiwan is geographically very close to China. The virus was confirmed to have
spread to Taiwan on January 21, 2020, through a 55-year-old woman who had
been teaching in Wuhan, China [28]. The virus strains from these regions are
also close together as can be seen from the SC2 tree, about 6 branches apart.
Similar relationship can also be inferred from the tree between China and South
Korea: the strain of the virus in South Korea is believed to be transmitted from
China firstly through a 35-year old Chinese woman and secondly by a 55-year
old South Korean national [29]. Interestingly, from the SC2 tree it can also be
deduced that the South Korean strain is very close to that of Taiwan and also
near to the strain from China. The incident of a Taiwanese woman being
deported from South Korea after refusing to stay at a quarantine facility can be a
probable explanation as to how the South Korean strain might have found its
path to Taiwan [46].
4. On March 2, 2020, the virus was confirmed to have reached Portugal, when it
was reported that a Portuguese 33 year-old man working in Spain was tested
positive for COVID-19 after returning home [49]. Subsequently, within a span of 9
days, 5 more cases were reported all originating from Spain [49][61]. The fact
that the first cases of COVID-19 in Portugal originated from Spain is clearly
captured in our SC2 tree.
5. The SC2 tree suggests that India’s strain is closely related to that from China and
also Italy (around 4 branches) and that it is also connected to that from Saudi Arabia.
These relationships can be explained as follows.
a. On January 30, India reported its first case of COVID-19 in Kerala, which rose to
three cases by February 3; all were students who had returned from Wuhan,
China [17][18].
b. On March 12, 2020, a 76-year-old man returning from Saudi Arabia became the
first death case of the virus in the country [19]. India didn’t impose a travel ban on
Saudi Arabia at that point also.
c. A Sikh preacher that returned from travel to Italy and Germany, carrying the
virus, turned into a "super spreader" by attending a Sikh festival in Anandpur
Sahib during 10–12 March [20][21].

6. Strains from Austria and Greece are quite close to each other and near to that of
Italy in the SC2 tree as they are believed to be transmitted from Italy. The two people
diagnosed with coronavirus in the Tyrol region of Austria were both Italian citizens [30]
and a Greek woman who recently returned home from northern Italy became Greece’s
first coronavirus case [31].
7. Turkey’s first identified case was a man who was travelling Europe [33]. Turkey also
announced a huge number of cases and subsequent deaths, which were originating
from Europe [47]. In our inferred relationship, we can see that the Turkish
representative strain is quite close to several Central and Western European countries
like Russia, Iceland and Ireland which can be backed up by the two facts stated above.
8. It is visible from the SC2 tree that the strain of Germany is very close to the strains of
both Poland and the USA. It might be the case that the community transmission
occurred concurrently in both USA and Poland from Germany which hit the peak of
pandemic before both USA and Poland [42].
9. Qatar has the second highest number of Covid-19 patients in the Middle-East [48].
The first case of Qatar was reported on February 27,2020 to be a man working in Iran
[55]. Qatar introduced a travel ban to and from Germany and the USA as precautionary
measures in Mid-March, quite a while later following the first occurrence. Qatar has 5
air-routes with Germany and USA, with more than 10 airlines operating in that route
[59][60]. Though the first case has originated from Iran, it might be the case that
subsequent patients were found to be travelling from the aforementioned countries as a
result of which the travel ban was introduced. Our estimated SC2 tree places Qatar very
close to both the USA and Germany.

10. While we can certainly explain many of the relationships identified by the estimated
SC2 tree a above, there are some relationships which are not that apparent. One such
example is the direct relationship between Vietnam and Greece. While apparently, there
exists no direct relationship, when investigated further, we identified something
interesting. Patient Zero of Greece is believed to have been contaminated during her
trip to the Milan Fashion week which took place during February 18-24, 2020 [45].
Interestingly, the first COVID-19 patient in Hanoi [16] left Hanoi on February 15 to visit
family members living in London, England and three days later, she traveled from
London to Milan City. Could she be in contact with Patient Zero of Greece or any other
who had been contaminated by the latter, before returning to London on February 20?
We can’t be certain, but our inferred relationship between Vietnam and Greece certainly
put a lot of legitimacy to that question.

11. Finally, we are unable to find any apparent explanation analyzing the reported news
sources for a few other strong relationships inferred by the tree (e.g., Congo-Iran,
Panama-Malaysia, Sweden-Singapore, Japan-Australia, etc). This could be because of
the inherent inaccuracies of the distance matrices as well as the limitations of the tree
estimation algorithms: none of these algorithms are 100% accurate. From another
angle, perhaps, the tree did identify these relationships correctly; but the relevant
incidences were not accurately identified or not documented.

Severity of some recent virus strains:
In recent times, the number of deaths is increasing rapidly in India. We have been
closely following the change in the virus strains of India before and after the cut-off date.
A genome sequence (EPI_ISL_435050) was collected on April 13, 2020 (before our cutoff date) from a patient in Ahmedabad, Gujrat, India. It was predicted to be a severe
strain (with low confidence) even though at that time we trained the classifier to consider
the Indian sequences as mild. According to our evolutionary relationship, India is very
close to both Italy and China. So, we calculated the distance between the
representative sequence of both Italy and China with this strain. We considered another
strain (EPI_ISL_437447) which was collected from another patient from the same place
in India on April 26, 2020 (after our cut-off date) and predicted the severity thereof. The
classifiers declared this isolate to be severe with very high confidence (about 98%). We
did the distance calculation like before. Interestingly, it was identified that this isolate is
closer to both Italy and China’s representative sequence than the previous less severe
one. This strongly suggests that there were some mutations that turned the Indian
sequences from mild or less severe to severe or highly severe, respectively.
Also, the sequences from the US states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Indiana, Illinois and
Florida that were collected on May 25, 2020 (about one month after our cut-off date)
were analyzed and our classifiers could correctly capture the severity of the genome
sequences (see Table 4 in the supplementary file).

Possible parents for some South Asian strains:
We conduct an analysis to predict possible parents of the (mutated) virus strains of the
South Asian Region (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan). Our mutation prediction pipeline
suggests that the strains of some states of the USA, namely, California, Massachusetts,
Texas, New Jersey and Maryland could be the parents/ancestors of these South Asian
strains. Now, the total deaths in these states up to June 1, 2020 are 4240, 6846, 1686,
11711 and 2532 respectively [58] and the strains thereof are also classified to be severe

by our classification pipeline. it thus seems quite likely that the sars-cov-2 situation in
these South-Asian countries will worsen in near future.
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are ranked 88th, 112th and 122nd in global health
performance compared to the United States of America which is at the 37th position [54].
In the majority of lower middle-income countries such as Bangladesh, India and
Pakistan, available hospital beds are < 1 bed per 1000 population and ICU beds are < 1
bed per 100,000 population [39]. Additionally, an uncontrolled epidemic is predicted to
have 6,000,220 deaths having a duration of nearly 200 days in the majority of these
countries [39]. These predictions coupled with our findings call for stern actions (i.e.,
interventions) on part of these countries.
