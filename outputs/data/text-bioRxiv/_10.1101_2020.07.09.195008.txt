Abstract

22

Background: Little is known about the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of environmental

23

surfaces and air in non-health care settings among COVID-19 cases.

24

Methods and findings: We explored the SARS-CoV-2 contamination of

25

environmental surfaces and air by collecting air and swabbing environmental surfaces

26

among 39 COVID-19 cases in Guangzhou, China. The specimens were tested by RT-

27

PCR testing. The information collected for COVID-19 cases included basic

28

demographic, clinical severity, onset of symptoms, radiological testing, laboratory

29

testing and hospital admission. A total of 641 environmental surfaces and air specimens

30

were collected among 39 COVID-19 cases before disinfection. Among them, 20

31

specimens (20/641, 3.1%) were tested positive from 9 COVID-19 cases (9/39, 23.1%),

32

with 5 (5/101, 5.0%) positive specimens from 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/220, 2.3%)

33

from 3 mild cases, and 10 (10/374, 2.7%) from 3 moderate cases. All positive

34

specimens were collected within 3 days after diagnosis, and 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were

35

found in toilet (5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21,

36

19.0%) in anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote),

37

1 (1/8, 12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet

38

pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3

39

(3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Air specimens in room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%)

40

were all negative.

41

Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 was found on environmental surfaces especially in toilet,

42

and could survive for several days. We provided evidence of potential for SARS-CoV-2

Introduction

46

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has precipitated a global crisis,

47

and it has resulted in 5404512 confirmed cases including with 343514 deaths globally

48

as of May 26, 2020[1]. Reported transmission modes of Severe Acute Respiratory

49

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among humans mainly through respiratory

50

droplets produced when an infected case sneezes or coughs[2]. People may be infected

51

by inhalation of virus laden liquid droplets, and infection is more likely when someone

52

are in close contact with COVID-19 cases[2-4]. However, the importance of indirect

53

contact transmission, such as environmental contamination, is uncertain[5-7].

54

Evidences suggested that environmental contamination with SARS-CoV-2 is likely to

55

be high, and it is supported by recent researches focus on environmental contamination

56

from COVID-19 cases in hospital[5-8]. Hospitals already have perfect disinfection

57

measures and are less likely to appear super-spreaders compared with community and

58

family[4,9-11]. However, the role of air and surface contamination in non-health care

59

settings is still need to be explored. Therefore, it is vital to understand the environmental

60

contamination of infected cases by SARS-CoV-2 in non-health care settings, which was

61

a vital aspect of controlling the spread of the epidemic.

62

To address this question, in this study, we sampled total of 641 surfaces

63

environmental and air specimens among 39 cases in Guangzhou, China, to explore the

64

surrounding environmental surfaces and air contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in non-

65

health care settings.

and air specimens were collected by Guangzhou CDC (GZCDC) from Feb 6 to Apr 10,

70

2020. The environmental surfaces specimens of COVID-19 cases sampled in home,

71

hotel, public area, restaurant, marketplace, car and pet, which was associated with

72

COVID-19 cases’ life trajectory before hospitalization. Air specimens of COVID-19

73

cases also sampled in their room (home or hotel). Based on cases’ reported activity

74

tracks, the number of specimens collected per COVID-19 case varied. All specimens

75

were collected before disinfection.

76

Demographic and epidemiological data

77

Case investigations were collected for COVID-19 cases including basic demographic

78

(age, sex, imported cases or not), date of symptoms onset, date of diagnosis, date of

79

environmental specimens collection, clinical severity, onset of symptoms (fever, dry

80

cough, expectoration, fatigue, myalgia and diarrhea), radiological testing (CT double

81

lung abnormalities), laboratory testing (white blood cell count, lymphocyte,

82

lymphocyte percentage, neutrophilic granulocyte, and neutrophilic granulocyte

83

percentage) and hospital admission.

84

Sample Collection

85

The environmental specimens of SARS-CoV-2 were collected by qualified technicians

86

who had received biosafety training (who had passed the training) and were equipped

87

with corresponding laboratory skills. Personal protective equipment (PPE) were

88

required for sampling personnel including N95 masks or masks with higher filtration

89

efficiency, goggles, protective clothing, double-layer latex gloves and waterproof boot

90

covers[12]. Sterile premoistened swabs were used for sampling, and then were put into

91

a tube containing 2 to 3 mL virus preservation solution (or isotonic saline solution,

92

tissue culture solution, or phosphate buffer) with swabs’ tail discarded and cap

tightened. For details, please refer to Protocol for Prevention and Control of COVID-

94

19 (Edition 6) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of

95

China[13]. The following types of surfaces were swabbed: (1) toilet (sink, faucet,

96

shower, toilet bowl, floor drain); (2) anteroom (chair, table, TV remote, water dispenser,

97

cup, bottle, TV bench, handrail); (3) kitchen (cutting board, bowl, chopsticks); (4)

98

bedroom (bed, sheet pillow, bedside table, telephone, computer, mouse, air conditioner,

99

fan); (5) door knobs and switch buttons in room; (6) air in room; (7) outside room

100

(elevator, elevator button, stair armrest); (8) car (steering wheel, seat, handlebar, air);

101

(9) pet (mouth, nose, anus). For each case, not all of the above samples were collected,

102

but only samples from the activity tracks reported by the COVID-19 case

103

himself/herself. Door knobs and switch buttons in room were not classified into specific

104

room locations due to the specimens were collected with mixed form, where were

105

commonly used by COVID-19 cases. And specimens in car (steering wheel, seat and

106

handlebar) were also mixed form.

107

Air specimens was sampled using an MD8 microbiological sampler (Sartorius,

108

Germany) and sterile gelatin filters (3 µm pores and 80 mm diameter, Sartorius,

109

Germany)[7,14]. Air specimens was sampled for 10 minutes in toilet, anteroom and

110

bedroom, 1 minutes in car at a speed of 50 L/minute. The filters were dissolved

111

aseptically in 30 mL virus preservation solution (or isotonic saline solution, tissue

112

culture solution, or phosphate buffer).

113

Laboratory Procedures

114

The environmental surfaces and air specimens for nucleic acid detection were stored at

115

-70 °C or below (specimens may be temporarily stored in -20 °C refrigerators in the

116

absence of -70 °C storage condition) and were tested as soon as possible. Laboratory

117

confirmation of environmental surfaces and air specimens was performed by qualified

118

staff, and results were identified through open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and

119

nucleocapsid protein (N) of SARA-CoV-2 by RT-PCR testing in accordance with the

120

protocol established by China CDC[12]. Details on laboratory processes are provided

121

in Appendix (appendix 1 p1-2).

122

Definitions

123

The asymptomatic persons infected with SARA-CoV-2 (asymptomatic cases in short)

124

refers to those who have no relevant clinical manifestations including clinically

125

detectable signs or self-perceived symptoms such as fever, cough, or sore throat, but

126

who have tested positive for SARA-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens or other

127

specimens[15]. Clinical classification of symptomatic cases includes 4 categories[16]:

128

mild, moderate, severe, and critical (appendix 2 p3). In this study, the COVID-19 cases

129

included asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases. Fever was defined

130

as an axillary temperature of 37.3°C or higher. Public area included elevator, elevator

131

buttons, and stair armrests. An imported case is a person who was infected with SARA-

132

CoV-2 in a foreign country and diagnosed in Guangzhou City.

133

Statistical analysis

134

Categorical variables were presented with frequency (percentage) and continuous

135

variables were summarized with median (interquartile range). Figures were drawn

136

using Office Excel (version 2019). Analyses were all performed with the SAS software

137

(version 9.4 for Windows, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

and hence individual informed consent was waived. The study was determined not to

142

be human subjects research and therefore was considered exempt from ethical approval

143

after consultation with the ethics committee of GZCDC. Analytical datasets were

144

constructed in an anonymized manner, and all analysis of personally identifiable data

145

took place onsite at the GZCDC.

Results

147

Characteristics of 39 COVID-19 cases. Among 39 COVID-19 cases, 23 (23/39,

148

59.0%) were male, 11 (11/39, 28.2%) were imported and the median age was 36.0 years

149

(interquartile range, 31.0 to 48.0 years). A total of 9 (9/39, 23.1%) asymptomatic cases

150

and 30 (30/39, 76.9%) symptomatic cases with 10 (10/30, 33.3%) mild, 19

151

(19/30,63.4%) moderate, and 1 (1/30, 3.3%) severe cases were identified, and all (39/39,

152

100.0%) were cured and discharged. Among them, the common onset of symptoms was

153

fever (24/39, 61.5%), dry cough (21/39, 53.9%), expectoration (9/39, 23.1%), fatigue

154

(6/39, 15.4%), myalgia (3/39, 7.7%), diarrhea (2/39, 5.1%), and 31 (31/37, 79.5%) with

166

All the 20 positive specimens were collected within 3 days (≤3 days) from diagnosis

167

to sampling (Figure 1), and 13 (13/259, 5.0%) positive environmental surfaces

168

specimens were collected from home, 6 (6/113, 5.3%) from hotel and 1 (1/5, 20.0%)

169

from car that had driven. While, specimens in restaurant that had eaten (0/30, 0.0%),

170

marketplace that had visited (0/122, 0.0%), pet that had lived with (0/4, 0.0%) and

171

public area that had stayed (0/108, 0.0%) were all negative by RT-PCR testing (Table

172

2).

173

Distribution of 20 positive environmental specimens among 9 COVID-19 cases. A

174

total of 136 environmental surfaces and air specimens were collected from 9 COVID-

175

19 cases who with at least one positive environmental specimen. Among them, 20

176

specimens (20/136, 14.7%) of specimens were tested positive by RT-PCR testing.

177

Among 20 positive environmental specimens, 10 (10/42, 23.8%) were found in toilet

178

(5 on toilet bowl, 4 on sink/faucet/shower, 1 on floor drain), 4 (4/21, 19.0%) in

179

anteroom (2 on water dispenser/cup/bottle, 1 on chair/table, 1 on TV remote), 1 (1/8,

12.5%) in kitchen (1 on dining-table), 1 (1/18, 5.6%) in bedroom (1 on bed/sheet

181

pillow/bedside table), 1 (1/5, 20.0%) in car (1 on steering wheel/seat/handlebar) and 3

182

(3/20, 21.4%) on door knobs. Surfaces specimens collected from outside room (0/13,

183

0.0%), air specimens collected from room (0/10, 0.0%) and car (0/1, 0.0%) were

184

negative by RT-PCR testing (Table 3, Figure 2).

189

surfaces especially in toilet, and could survive for several days. Our study provided

190

evidence of potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contamination of

191

environmental surfaces. All air specimens were negative. To our known, this study is

192

the largest sample of environmental specimens with COVID-19 cases.

193

Previous studies showed that if one person contacted frequently with COVID-19

194

cases, he or she would have high incidence of infected SARS-CoV-2[3,17-19],

195

presumably due to inhalation of droplets or contact transmission. Mathematical and

196

animal models, and intervention researches suggested that contact transmission was the

197

most important route in some scenarios[20]. In current study, several environmental

198

specimens sampled from home, hotel and car were tested positive by RT-PCR testing,

199

where were the sites that COVID-19 cases contacted frequently. Our results further

200

demonstrated the possibility of contact transmission through environmental

201

contamination probably due to self-inoculation of mucous membranes of mouth, nose

202

or eyes through hands, resulting in high chance to infect SARS-CoV-2. Similar findings

203

were made during SARS-CoV[21] and MERS-CoV[22] outbreak, in which RT-PCR

204

positive swab specimens were confirmed from frequently touched environmental

205

surfaces in patients’ rooms, such as medication refrigerator door, bed table and a

206

television remote control. In other sites, such as restaurant and marketplace, there was

207

no positive environmental specimens by RT-PCR testing in our study. However, all

208

surrounding environmental contamination from COVID-19 cases should be alert.

209

Although, the RT-PCR testing among specimens in restaurant and marketplace was

210

negative, the huge number of people exposed to there also existed great risk. Previous

211

study showed that the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with environmental

212

contamination in restaurant[23]. In addition, some studies reported that all identified

213

COVID-19 outbreaks of cluster confirmed cases occurred in an indoor environment[24],

214

suggesting sharing indoor space was a major risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

215

All environmental specimens were collected before they were diagnosed in our study,

216

which indicated that a person who exposed to environmental contamination from

217

COVID-19 cases had a high infected risk unknowingly. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 had

218

a great opportunity of surviving for a while on surfaces such as toilet, anteroom, and

219

kitchen in current study. Therefore, we suggested that home quarantine for suspected

220

COVID-19 cases might be not a good control strategy. It was difficult to ensure that

221

cluster infection did not occur in families during the quarantine period for at least

222

fourteen days because they shared areas like toilets during quarantine. Previous study

223

also suggested that home quarantine required personal protective equipment and

224

professional training, but for ordinary people and families, especially those living

225

together in a narrow space, was obviously hard to implement excellent infection control,

226

causing other families to be infected[11,25,26] and centralized quarantine was

227

recommended in this condition[27].

228

Previous study showed that COVID-19 cases with severe disease had significantly

229

higher viral loads than that with mild disease in respiratory specimens[28]. We tried to

230

explore whether the more serious the COVID-19, the more contaminated to the

231

environment surfaces. In this study, 24 environmental surfaces specimens were

232

collected in marketplace from one severe COVID-19 cases, and the specimens’ RT-

233

PCR testing was negative, which was probably due to the sampling site was where he

234

or she came into contact occasionally. In other cases, several environmental surfaces

235

specimens were tested positive with 5 (5/32, 15.6%) for 3 asymptomatic cases, 5 (5/53,

236

9.4%) for 3 mild cases, 10 (10/51, 19.6%) for 3 moderate cases, suggesting all cases

237

would contaminate environmental surfaces. In addition, COVID-19 cases without

238

symptoms like fever, dry cough, expectoration, fatigue, myalgia, diarrhea, were more

239

likely to have positive specimens of SARS-CoV-2. It might due to that people with

240

symptoms were quarantined more quickly in general, while, people without symptoms

241

would continue to contaminated the environmental surfaces and air before they were

242

admitted to hospital. We highly recommend that persons no matter COVID-19 cases or

243

general public should conduct hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to

244

minimize self-contamination and to protect against inoculation of mucosal surfaces and

245

the respiratory tract[29].

246

Evidence suggested that influenza virus, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV could survive

247

on environmental surfaces for extended periods, sometimes up to months[20,30-32]. It

248

suggested that prolonged potential transmission of coronavirus might be existed via

249

contact or fomite. Among environmental surfaces specimens in our study, all positive

250

specimens were collected within 3 days (≤3 days) after diagnosis. It means that without

251

disinfection, the SARS-CoV-2 could survive on environmental surfaces for at least 3

252

days, and in other studies, the survival time was 0 to 14 days[33-36], which was

253

consistent with current understanding. Therefore, enhance surfaces cleaning and

254

disinfection were important and essential[20].

255

Whether

SARS-CoV-2

can

be

transmitted

by

aerosols

remains

256

controversial[5,37,38]. Fortunately, all air specimens from COVID-19 cases were

257

negative in our study, and other studies also showed that air specimens were negative

258

despite the extent of environmental contamination in hospital[7,37]. However, aerosol

259

specimens in two Wuhan hospitals were tested positive collected from toilet areas, areas

260

prone to crowding, medical staff areas[5], and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might have

261

potential to be transmitted via aerosols. Therefore, routine disinfection and cloth masks

262

were recommended and some study suggested that cloth masks could potentially

265

Limitations

266

This study has several limitations. Firstly, the results of RT-PCR testing do not indicate

267

the amount of viable virus, and viral culture was not done to demonstrate viability.

268

Secondly, due to operational limitations during the outbreak, days of sampling interval

269

was inconsistent. However, it also provided additional information about SARS-CoV-

270

2 survival. Third, the number of air specimens represented only a small fraction of total

271

specimens, and air exchanges in room would have diluted the presence of SARS-CoV-2

272

in the air. Further studies are required to confirm these preliminary results.

273

Conclusions

274

SARS-CoV-2 was found on environmental surfaces especially in toilet, and could

275

survive for several days. Our study provided evidence of potential for SARS-CoV-2

276

transmission through contamination of environmental surfaces.

Figure 1. Distribution of positive environmental specimens by days from date of
symptoms onset or diagnosis to sampling (day 0 means sampling at the same day
with symptom onset or diagnosis).
Note: Environmental specimens were tested by RT-PCR testing; 5 positive
environmental specimens of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were excluded in bars of
symptoms onset to sampling.
Figure 2. Distribution of 136 environmental specimens among 9 COVID-19 cases.
Note: (+) represents positive environmental surfaces specimens, and (−) represents
negative environmental surfaces and air specimens; the number represents the count of
negative/positive environmental specimens; white blank represents without specimens.
