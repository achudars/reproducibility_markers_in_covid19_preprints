Abstract

23

Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 include screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be re-

24

purposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African

25

green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit

26

decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication

27

and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing

28

serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected

29

viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a

30

significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for

31

the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino

32

acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited

33

a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL,

34

and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL.

35

Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2

36

refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability

37

of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs,

38

including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir

39

showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine,

40

mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.

Importance

42

The cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed

43

significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived

44

cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a

45

valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations

46

could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a

47

good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike

48

glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801,

49

two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral

50

activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target

51

cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader

52

tropism.

Introduction

54

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for COVID-19,

55

was first identified in China in early 20201, but has reached pandemic proportions with over 29 million

56

people infected worldwide by September of 20202. Although a hallmark of COVID-19 is the

57

development of various levels of lung affection from mild upper airway symptoms to life-threatening

58

pneumonia, additional distinctive features of the disease are vascular changes3 and numerous

59

extrapulmonary manifestations and systemic complications4.

60

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been classified within the Coronaviridae family, Betacoronavirus genus

61

and Sarbecovirus subgenus5. It is most closely related to SARS-like betacoronavirus of bat origin, but

62

its genomic organization is very similar to the well-characterized SARS-CoV1. Its genome consists of a

63

long positive sense, single strand RNA molecule of approximately 30 kb, following the classical

64

genomic organization of viruses belonging to this family, with untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5’ and

65

3’ ends and numerous open reading frames (ORF) throughout the coding sequences1. Separate ORFs

66

encode the structural components, including the spike glycoprotein (S), the envelope (E), the

67

membrane (M), and the nucleocapsid (N), as well as various accessory proteins1. The largest ORFs (1a

68

and 1ab) encode the nonstructural proteins of the virus (nsp), responsible for the RNA synthesis

69

machinery1. The viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) is an attractive drug target for

70

antiviral therapy. However, identifying nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) with anti-coronavirus activity is

71

challenged by the viral nsp14 protein, which has 3' to 5' proofreading exoribonuclease capacity, and

72

only a very limited number of molecules have been shown to overcome this activity6.

73

Drug repurposing, compared to de-novo drug discovery, significantly shortens the time and reduces the

74

cost of developing antivirals for emerging pandemic viral diseases. Two of the antiviral molecules that

75

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and other pandemic coronaviruses are broad-spectrum antivirals remdesivir and

76

β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC), which were initially part of antiviral discovery programs for the

77

treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections7,8. Remdesivir is now included in standard of care

78

treatment of COVID-19 patients in several countries. It is therefore relevant to continue searching for

79

such compounds, focusing on the molecules that exhibit a good safety profile in humans and

80

developing appropriate models for their pre-clinical screening in cell culture.

81

SARS-CoV-2 infects the epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract and in the lungs in humans,

82

however, established cell lines differ in their support for SARS-CoV-2 viral production9. Various

83

clones of the African green monkey kidney cell line “Vero” support the highest levels of SARS-CoV-2

84

replication and propagation, however, not being a human cell line Vero cells show limitations for drug

85

screening, especially for screening of prodrugs that have been designed to be metabolized in human

86

cells10. Calu-3, a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line11, supports SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication

87

with viral particle production, but at lower levels than those observed in Vero cells10,12. Other viruses,

88

such as HCV, also exhibit restricted culture viability, and efficient replication and propagation of HCV

89

is limited to specific clones derived from the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7), including Huh7.513,14.

90

In this study, we aimed at establishing more efficient and robust platforms for the culture of SARS-

91

CoV-2 in human cells through viral adaptation, permitting basic studies of the virus, including the

92

screening of antiviral compounds, in relevant cell lines.

2/human/Denmark/ DK-AHH1/2020) in Vero E6 cells. Vero cells, which permit the isolation of

96

SARS-CoV-2 with high efficiency, were used to obtain the initial virus stock. Vero E6 cells were

97

inoculated with a diluted nasopharyngeal sample from a COVID-19 patient diagnosed with SARS-

98

CoV-2 infection. On day 3 after inoculation, cell cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, which peaked

99

at day 7. At first, CPE was characterized by the presence of syncytia, followed by the appearance of

100

moderate cell death. Severe CPE with significant cell death was not observed until days 6-7. Culture

101

supernatants were harvested daily during the first 5 days of the experiment and the infectivity titers

102

(expressed as tissue culture infectious dose 50% per milliliter (Log10TCID50/mL)) were determined

103

using Vero E6 cells and were found to peak at day 4 at 6.4 Log10TCID50/mL.

104

The culture supernatant harvested at day 2 post-inoculation was used to perform a first passage

105

infection of naïve Vero E6 cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02. After passage to naïve

106

cells, CPE was observed at day 2. Two independent second passages were performed using the culture

107

supernatants harvested at days 2 and 3, respectively. CPE was observed promptly after infection, and a

108

large volume of supernatant was harvested at days 2 and 3 from both independent experiments. These

109

supernatants were combined to generate a stock virus (referred to as P2VeroE6) that was further

110

characterized and used for the additional experiments described below. The infectivity titer of the

111

P2VeroE6 virus stock was 5.5 Log10TCID50/mL.

112

We determined the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (including the 5’ and 3’ UTRs) of the

113

original patient virus and of the P2VeroE6 virus as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in

114

Table 1, the isolate SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020, referred to as SARS-CoV-2_DK-

115

AHH1 hereinafter, exhibits only 10 nucleotide differences when compared to the reference sequence of

116

the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (genbank NC045512.2). Among these, 6 differences lead to amino acid

117

changes in the nsp2, nsp12, S, ORF3a, and N genomic regions. SARS-CoV-2_DK-AHH1 harbors the

118

high frequency polymorphisms D614G in S, which is now dominant throughout the world and has been

119

linked to increased infectivity in pseudo-typed virus assays in cell culture15, and P323L in nsp12, which

120

has not yet been linked to any phenotype. Compared to the original clinical sample, the virus recovered

121

after 2 passages in Vero E6 cells (P2VeroE6) was remarkably similar, with only one new change

122

emerging in a small subset of the viral population (C71T in the 5’UTR). Additionally, G22487A

123

(amino acid change E309K in the S-protein), which was the only consensus difference between isolate

124

DK-AHH1 and the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 not fixed (frequency under 99%) in the viral

125

population, further decreased in frequency after passage in Vero E6 cells from 81.8% to 56.9% (Table

126

1).

127

SARS-CoV-2 can be adapted to efficient growth in human hepatoma cells (cell clone Huh7.5). We

128

performed inoculations of Huh7.5 cells with the P2VeroE6 virus to determine the susceptibility and

129

permissiveness of this cell line. The virus supernatant derived from this first passage was used to

130

inoculate naïve Huh7.5 cells to perform the next passage and successively until passage 6 (Figure 1a).

131

We observed that the emergence of CPE occurred earlier and was more evident as the passage number

132

increased, suggesting viral adaptation. In passage 1 in Huh7.5 cells, CPE was not observed until day 8

133

post-infection, and the magnitude of the CPE was low at this time, with only minor changes in the

134

morphology of the cells, in contrast to the CPE observed in the passage 6 culture, which displayed

135

massive cell death by day 4 post-infection. The 5th passage in Huh7.5 was performed in big cell flasks,

136

in order to generate a large volume of supernatant that could be used for characterization of the Huh7.5

137

adapted virus (this virus will be referred to as P5Huh7.5 virus).

138

We performed a comparative titration in various cells of the P2VeroE6 and the P5Huh7.5 viruses (Figure

139

1b) and found that the infectivity titers in Huh7.5 cells after culture adaptation had increased by more

140

than 3 logs (mean of 4.7 and 8.0 Log10TCID50/mL, respectively). The Huh7.5 adapted virus also

141

exhibited significantly increased titers in Vero E6 cells (mean of 7.0 Log10TCID50/mL for the P5Huh7.5

142

virus versus 5.5 Log10TCID50/mL for the P2VeroE6 virus). Interestingly, the original P2VeroE6 virus was

143

less viable in the Huh7 parental cell line than in the Huh7.5 clone, however, adaptation to the Huh7.5

144

clone also led to a significant increase in infectivity titers in Huh7 cells (3.8 and 7.7 Log10TCID50/mL

145

for the P2VeroE6 and P5Huh7.5 viruses, respectively).

146

Visual observations of P5Huh7.5 virus infected cultures in the light microscope indicated an increase in

147

CPE. To better quantify this, we performed viral cytopathic effect assays (CPE assays, Figure 1c), in

148

which we detected an evident increase in CPE titers (Log10CPE50/mL) in all cells. CPE significantly

149

increased from 4.6 to 6.2 Log10CPE50/mL in Vero E6 cells. In Huh7.5 cells, the P2VeroE6 virus was not

150

cytopathic (we obtained a value just above the assay threshold in one of the independent experiments),

151

whereas the P5Huh7.5 virus led to high titers of 7.3 Log10CPE50/mL. For the Huh7 parental cells the

152

P2VeroE6 virus was also non-cytopathic, but the adapted P5Huh7.5 yielded 6.1 Log10CPE50/mL.

153

In addition to the increase in infectivity titers observed after infection with the adapted P5Huh7.5 virus in

154

Huh7.5 cells, we also noticed an evident increase in the intensity of the antigen staining (α-spike

155

protein antibody), and in the number of infected cells at non-cytopathic virus dilutions of the P5Huh7.5

156

virus compared to the P2VeroE6 virus (Figure 1d). This suggest that the P5Huh7.5 virus might both

8

157

replicate and propagate at higher levels in Huh7.5 cells, as also indicated by the significant increase in

158

CPE titers. In contrast, no such evident differences were observed upon infection of Vero E6 cells with

159

the adapted virus despite the increase in infectivity titers (data not shown).

160

The near complete genome sequence of the Huh7.5 adapted viruses (P1, P5 and P6) was obtained and

161

analyzed. We found mutations leading to amino acid changes in several nonstructural and structural

162

proteins compared to P2VeroE6 (Table 2). The region coding for the spike protein accumulated a

163

significant number of high frequency (>90% of the viral population) changes, including a deletion

164

leading to the removal of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain (from nt. 21762 to nt. 21788) and

165

3 non-synonymous mutations: A23014C (E484D aa change according to S-protein specific

166

numbering), C23997G (P812R), and A24424C (Q954H). The deletion and the E484D substitution were

167

already dominant (frequency >90%) after the first passage in Huh7.5 cells (P1Huh7.5, Table 2).

168

Outside S, the only other positions in which we found clear indication of evolution at the amino acid

169

level (that is sustained increase in frequency of a residue over the three analyzed Huh7.5 passages)

170

were T11522G (F184V according to nsp6 specific protein number), C19895T (A92V according to

171

nsp15 specific protein number), C26333T (T30I according to E specific protein number), and C28331T

172

(P20S according to N specific protein number) (Table 2).

173

Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to efficient growth in human hepatoma cells (Huh7.5) leads to robust

174

culture in Calu-1 and A549 lung carcinoma cells. We reasoned that the Huh7.5-adapted viruses

175

might facilitate culture in other human cell lines, including respiratory tract cell lines that would be the

176

most relevant infection model for culture studies. So far, only the Calu-3 cell line has been shown to

177

support, to a limited extent, SARS-CoV-2 productive infections, however, the A549 cell line is

9

178

refractory to infection12,16. To our knowledge, the ability of the Calu-1 cell line to support SARS-CoV-

179

2 replication and propagation has not been previously reported. The Calu-1 and the A549 cell lines are

180

widely available and well-characterized standards among the human lung carcinoma/alveolar cell lines

181

used in cancer research17,18. Further, the A549 cell line is also a model for the study of respiratory

182

viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and influenza19,20.

183

Compared to the P2VeroE6 virus, the P5Huh7.5 virus exhibited a significant increase in the ability to infect

184

Calu-1 cells with >2-log increase in infectivity titers. For the original P2VeroE6 virus, observed titers in

185

Calu-1 were 3.5 Log10TCID50/mL, which increased to 6.0 Log10TCID50/mL for the P5Huh7.5 virus

186

(Figure 2a). Surprisingly, the P5Huh7.5 virus was able to efficiently infect A549 cells, with titers of 6.0

187

Log10TCID50/mL; the A549 cells could not be infected with the P2VeroE6 virus (Figure 2a). Albeit at

188

lower levels than in Huh7.5, we could also detect CPE in Calu-1 and A549 cells infected with the

189

P5Huh7.5 virus, for which no CPE was observed with the original virus (Figure 2b), indicating enhanced

190

replication.

191

In addition to the increase in infectivity and CPE titers observed after infection of the Calu-1 and A549

192

cells with the P5Huh7.5 compared to the P2VeroE6 virus, we also detected an increment in the intensity of

193

the antigen staining (α-spike protein antibody) and in the number of infected cells upon inoculation

194

with the same dilution of these viruses (Figure 2c). Thus, and in accordance with our observations in

195

Huh7.5 cells, both better replication and propagation was achieved with the P5Huh7.5 virus.

196

Improved activity of remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in human Huh7.5 cells. Remdesivir was

197

previously reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero21–23 and human lung cells (Calu-3)10. Here, we

198

found EC50 values of 1.5 µM in the concentration-response assays with the P2VeroE6 virus in Vero E6

10

199

cells (Figure 3a). Further we demonstrated that this drug displayed ~50-fold higher activity against the

200

same virus (P2VeroE6) in Huh7.5 cells (EC50 of 0.03 µM, Figure 3b). For comparison, we found that

201

remdesivir is a very potent inhibitor of different genotypes of HCV in Huh7.5 cells, with EC50 values

202

between 0.08-0.19 µM (Figure 3c). Lastly, we observed that the Huh7.5 adapted virus (P5Huh7.5)

203

yielded similar EC50 values for remdesivir as the P2VeroE6 virus when tested in Huh7.5 cells (EC50

204

values of 0.05 µM and 0.03 µM, respectively) (Table 3 and Figure 3b). Thus, the adapted P5Huh7.5 virus

205

represents a useful virus for the screening of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase inhibitors in human hepatoma

206

cells.

207

Screening of the antiviral activity of a panel of nucs in human cells, using adapted SARS-CoV-2.

208

The adapted P5Huh7.5 virus permitted drug testing in Huh7.5, Calu-1 and A549 cells. We focused our

209

screen on nucs previously shown to have antiviral effect against HCV, including sofosbuvir, a

210

pangenotypic HCV drug used in the clinic24, but we also included broader-spectrum molecules such as

211

galidesivir, favipiravir and ribavirin.

212

Among the nucs tested only remdesivir and EIDD-2801 displayed significant effect across the human

213

cells (Table 3), as previously described25. Remdesivir was most active in Huh7.5 cells, with ~6-fold

214

lower EC50 values when compared to Calu-1 and A549 cells (Figure 4a). Despite being less active in

215

lung carcinoma than in hepatoma cells, remdesivir was still more active in lung carcinoma Calu-1 and

216

A549 than in Vero E6 cells (about 5-fold lower EC50 compared to the P2VeroE6 virus). The opposite was

217

observed for EIDD-2801 (Figure 4b), which was more active in A549 and Calu-1 cells (6- and 3-fold

218

more active with EC50 of 1.3 µM and 2.7 µM, respectively) than in Huh7.5 cells (8.5 µM). Finally,

219

galidesivir exhibited limited activity (Figure 4c) with relatively high EC50 (>20 µM); the best inhibitory

11

220

effect was observed in A549 cells (EC50 of 24 µM). Other nucs, including sofosbuvir, had no apparent

221

activity (EC50 >50 µM) in these human cell lines with our experimental conditions (Table 3).

222

Discussion

223

In this study, we performed isolation of SARS-CoV-2 (isolate DK-AHH1) in Vero E6 cells and

224

subsequent serial passage of the virus in human hepatoma cells (Huh7.5 clone) that led to adaptation of

225

the virus with increased infectivity and cytopathic effect titers in both Vero E6 and Huh7.5 cells. Most

226

importantly, human hepatoma cell culture adaptation significantly increased the viral viability in lung

227

carcinoma cells Calu-1 and A549, as well as in the parental Huh7 cell line, which do not efficiently

228

support replication and propagation of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. Thus, the adapted virus might

229

permit culture across additional human cell lines, a proposition that should be the topic of future

230

investigations. We demonstrated that the adapted virus is an efficient tool for the screening of putative

231

SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds in human cells. Active molecules, such as remdesivir and EIDD-

232

2801, exhibited increased activity in human cells when compared to Vero E6, highlighting the

233

importance of testing nucs in the appropriate target cells.

234

The Huh7.5 cell line was originally selected to permit higher replication levels of HCV subgenomic

235

replicons13 and it has been of fundamental importance for the development of efficient full-length cell

236

culture systems for HCV14. Compared to the parental Huh7, the Huh7.5 clone exhibits a mutation that

237

inactivates the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), an interferon-inducible cellular helicase involved

238

in the type-1 interferon response, one of the features that has been correlated to increased

239

permissiveness to HCV replication26. Interestingly, Huh7 cells are highly susceptible and permissive to

240

SARS-CoV, which induces lytic and productive infections27. A recent study demonstrated that SARS-

241

CoV-2 is more sensitive to type-1 interferons than SARS-CoV28. Therefore decreased type-1 interferon

242

responses might be a key feature for enhancing the cell culture viability of SARS-CoV-2, correlating

243

with the high permissiveness of the Vero cell lines, which lack genes encoding type-1 interferons29.

244

Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to Huh7.5 cells caused an accumulation of substitutions in the S genomic

245

region, which might be the most important contributors to the significant increase in the viability of the

246

virus in lung carcinoma cells. The first complete change (present at frequencies of >99% after the first

247

passage) was the deletion of a loop (IHVSGTNGT) in the N-terminal domain of S. This deletion leads

248

to the removal of amino acid N74, which is N-glycosylated30; this loop is not present in SARS-CoV,

249

but it is found in MERS-CoV (Figure 5a,b). However, it is unclear how this change could contribute to

250

enhanced viability in culture. Another change that emerged early in most viruses was E484D, which is

251

located in the receptor binding motif of the receptor binding domain. Noticeably, an in silico study of

252

E484D predicted higher ACE2 binding affinity that could render a more infectious SARS-CoV-2

253

virus31.

254

P812R emerged only in the latest passages, when the virus exhibited maximum infectivity. P812 is

255

positioned near the S2’ cleavage site. The proline is also present in SARS-CoV, however, at that

256

position, R is present in MERS-CoV (Figure 5c,d). P812R changes the sequence from “PSKR” to

257

“RSKR”, which corresponds to the furin consensus cleavage motif (“RX[K/R]R”)32,33, thus a putative

258

second furin cleavage site could have emerged at the S2’site. Whether the emergence of a new furin

259

cleavage motif nearby the S2’ plays a role in culture adaptation by increasing membrane fusion and

260

therefore infectivity as seen in SARS-CoV, warrants further investigation34,35. Similarly, it was found

261

that cell culture adaptation (Vero cells) of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (Beaudette strain)

262

led to the acquisition of a mutation in the S-protein creating a novel furin site downstream of the S1/S2

263

site that was implicated in the entry and syncytium formation in Vero cells36. On the other hand,

264

deletions in the S1-S2 furin cleavage site have been found during culture adaptation in Vero E6

265

cells23,37. Finally, Q954H was present at low frequency in P1 but increased significantly in the last

266

passages, consistent with the maximum increase in viral infectivity. Residue Q954 locates within the

267

S2 subunit, which undergoes conformational rearrangements from prefusion to post fusion states.

268

Specifically, this position is located within the heptad repeat 1 (HR1), which is part of the fusion-active

269

core structure38.

270

As described here by us and elsewhere by others, the A549 cell line is refractory to infection with

271

SARS-CoV-216. For SARS-CoV, it was initially shown that low susceptibility of A549 correlated to a

272

lack of ACE2 expression39 and that exogeneous expression supported enhanced SARS-CoV

273

replication. However, natural ACE2 expression in A549 cells was reported by other groups40,41.

274

Another essential host entry factor for SARS-CoV-2 is the transmembrane protease, serine 2

275

(TMPRSS2)32. Vero E6 expressing TMPRSS2 permit enhanced isolation of SARS-CoV-212.

276

TMPRSS2 is also essential for entry of SARS-CoV, specifically the isoform 1 of the protein, directly

277

linked to the activation of the spike protein42. This isoform was found to be expressed in virus target

278

cells (such as Calu-3), but was lacking in the A549 cells42. Interestingly, TMPRRS2 was not detected

279

in Huh7 cells43 either, and thus this could be one of the contributors to the poor virus viability in A549

280

and in Huh7 cells. It is tempting to speculate that a possible explanation for the significant enhanced

281

viability of the Huh7.5 adapted virus in A549 and Huh7 cells, could relate to the acquisition of the furin

282

cleavage site by substitution P812R, which could compensate for a putative low activation of the spike

283

due to inadequate TMPRRS2 expression. This finding merit further investigations.

284

The efficient culture of SARS-CoV-2 permitted the screening of a class of polymerase inhibitors (nucs)

285

in relevant cell culture models. As previously described by others, we found that nucs remdesivir and

286

EIDD-2801 exhibited increased activity in human cells compared to Vero cells10,25. For remdesivir,

287

maximum activity was observed when using human hepatoma cells, as expected since this compound

288

originated from the HCV antiviral program, and like sofosbuvir, is masked by a McGuigan prodrug

289

moiety, leading to a significant accumulation of the active compound in the liver44. In the present

290

study, we also show proof-of-concept of the potent inhibitory effect of remdesivir against recombinants

291

of HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3 that recapitulate the entire viral life cycle, with EC50 values lower than

292

those routinely obtained with sofosbuvir45–48. For EIDD-2801, maximal activity was observed in lung

293

cells, in agreement with previous studies showing high activity of the drug in human airway epithelia

294

infected with influenza virus49. The EC50 values of remdesivir in Vero E6 and Calu-1 cells obtained in

295

this study were very similar to those reported before for Vero and Calu-3 cells, respectively10.

296

However, for EIDD-2801 (oral bioavailable prodrug of NHC) the EC50 values in Calu-1 and A549 cells

297

were higher than previously reported NHC values in Calu-325, which could be explained by the use of

298

the prodrug in our study.

299

Our investigated panel of nucs included molecules that had been previously shown to inhibit the virus

300

(remdesivir and EIDD-2801), but also compounds that had been proposed as drug candidates.

301

Strikingly no other analogs than remdesivir and EIDD-2801 showed a significant inhibitory effect in

302

our experimental conditions, including sofosbuvir, which had been the subject of extensive in silico

303

investigations50 and was found to cause chain termination of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase in vitro51. It

304

is important to acknowledge that studies only assessing incorporation and chain termination of

305

nucleotide analogs as antiviral strategies against coronaviruses lack a complete overview of the

15

306

structural requirements for viral replication, including the role of the nsp14 exonuclease in excising

307

these molecules, which remdesivir overcomes52. Favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral with similar

308

mechanism of action to EIDD-2801, exhibited no antiviral effect in our experimental conditions, but

309

contrarily showed anecdotal activity in patients53. However proper randomized trials are needed to

310

confirm these findings.

311

The broad-spectrum nuc galidesivir54 exhibited a detectable inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, but

312

significantly lower activity when compared to remdesivir and EIDD-2801. In light of the detectable

313

inhibitory effect, it could be relevant to test the efficacy of this drug in primary airway cultures and in

314

longer-term treatment assays where multiple doses of the compound are added into the culture to

315

further elucidate the potential antiviral use of this compound.

316

We demonstrated that the activity of remdesivir in Huh7.5 cells was very similar between the P2VeroE6

317

and the adapted P5Huh7.5 virus, despite the later exhibiting multiple changes in the genome. Since these

318

changes concentrated in the S-protein and not in the nsp12 protein, which is the main target of nucs,

319

this virus represents an excellent tool to study this drug class in human cells. However, the mutations

320

present in the adapted virus could potentially interfere with entry processes and therefore this

321

experimental system might not be an optimal tool for the screening of entry/fusion inhibitors.

322

It is important to continue evaluating antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2, that could also be

323

applied to other pandemic coronaviruses. Our cell culture adapted virus with increased viability in

324

human cells could contribute to a more efficient and relevant screening of candidate compounds

325

inhibiting viral replication. The cell-culture adaptation strategy shown in this study can represent a

326

venue for the efficient culture of other coronaviruses with restricted viability in human cell lines.

Materials and Methods

328

Cell culture experiments. All experiments in this study were performed with a novel isolate of the

329

SARS-CoV-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2/human/Denmark/DK-AHH1/2020). Initial culture of SARS-CoV-

330

2_DK-AHH1 was performed in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6). Residual

331

nasopharyngeal sample material was obtained after clinical diagnosis with COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2

332

Ct value of 14 in RT-PCR assay55) and irreversible anonymization. For inoculation, 30 µL of the

333

diluted sample were added into 100,000 Vero E6 cells, seeded in 12-well plates, 24 hour prior, at a

334

final volume of 1 mL. For the initial inoculation experiment, Vero E6 cells were cultured in DMEM

335

(high glucose, GlutaMAX and pyruvate, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

336

(Sigma) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (10,000 units/mL of penicillin, 10,000 µg/mL of streptomycin,

337

and 25 µg/mL of Amphotericin B, Gibco) and kept at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2.

338

Afterwards, all experiments in Vero E6 were performed with media supplemented only with FBS 10%,

339

10,000 units penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin/mL (Sigma). The culture was visually inspected under

340

an inverted light microscope and supernatant was harvested daily and stored at -80°C. A first viral

341

passage from the original inoculated culture was performed with 0.5 mL of harvested supernatant from

342

day 2 post-inoculation in naïve Vero E6 cells in a T-25 flask with 106 cells, with a final volume of 4

343

mL (approximate MOI of 0.02). Two independent second passages were performed with supernatants

344

harvested at passage 1 day 2 (approximate MOI of 0.9) and day 3 (MOI not determined), respectively.

345

For that purpose, 1.5 mL of first passage supernatant was used to infect 5×106 cells (final volume of 30

346

mL). A large viral stock was prepared by pooling 30 mL of filtered supernatant (0.45 µM filter,

347

Sartorius) from the samples harvested at days 2 and 3 from both second passages (total of 120 mL),

348

aliquoted, and stored at -80°C.

349

Human hepatoma cells (Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells) and Calu-1 were cultured in DMEM (high glucose,

350

GlutaMAX and pyruvate, Invitrogen ThermoFisher) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

351

(Sigma), 10,000 units penicillin and 10 mg streptomycin/mL (Sigma), and kept at 37°C in a humidified

352

incubator with 5% CO2. A549 cells were cultured in the same conditions but with Ham's F-12K

353

(Kaighn's) Medium (Gibco, ThermoFisher) supplemented with the same 10% fetal bovine serum and

354

antibiotics. Culture of HCV was performed as previously described14,45,46.

355

Serial passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Huh7.5 cells. A total of six passages were conducted in

356

Huh7.5 cells. Passages were performed by inoculating 106 naïve cells (seeded in a T-25 flask) with a

357

1/10 dilution of the P2VeroE6 virus (P1) or with 0,5 mL of supernatant for subsequent passages. The fifth

358

passage was carried out in T-175 flasks (approximately 5 million cells seeded), for production of a

359

large volume to generate a viral stock, which was used for the subsequent assays.

360

Determination of viral titers. Infectivity titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose

361

per mL (TCID50/mL). TCID50 assays were performed in 96-well plates, by infecting naïve cells with

362

100 µL of 10-fold serially diluted virus containing supernatants, in quadruplicates, followed by

363

immunostaining of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (as described below) at 72-hr post infection.

364

Presence or absence of infected cells in each replicate was scored and used to determine TCID50/mL

365

values based on calculations obtained by the Reed and Muench method (as described in Fields

366

Virology, 5th edition56).

367

A CPE assay to determine the cytopathic effect 50% titer (CPE50/mL) was developed with similar

368

conditions as those for the infectivity assay with infections of naïve cells with 100 µL of 10-fold

369

dilutions of virus containing supernatants, in quadruplicates. CPE was assessed 72-hr post infection

370

with the Viral ToxGlo Assay (Promega) following the manufacture’s instructions. Relative light units

371

(RLU) obtained for each infected well was normalized to the RLU of non-infected controls (100% cell

372

normality or cell viability), values under 90% were considered positive for CPE, and the Reed and

373

Muench method was used to calculate a Log10 CPE50/mL titer. The assay was validated by correlating

374

titer values obtained with the Viral ToxGlo Assay with visual inspections of the cells under a light

375

microscope in multiple assays.

376

All graphical representations and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.

377

Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from the

378

original clinical specimen and from all cell-culture derived supernatants was performed in an identical

379

manner with next-generation sequencing of near-full-length genomes from 5 overlapping-amplicons in

380

each pool. The methodologies for RNA extraction, generation of cDNA by reverse-transcription (RT)

381

and amplification of these overlapping amplicons were adapted from existing protocols for the

382

amplification of the complete open-reading frame of HCV57. Specific SARS-CoV-2 primers can be

383

found in Table 4. Determination of the 5’UTR of the original clinical specimen and of the cell culture

384

recovered P2VeroE6 viruses was determined using a template-switching RT method and reagents from

385

New England Biolabs and following guidelines. Gene-specific RT primers can be found in Table 4.

386

The 3’UTR was determined by RT-PCR with an oligo-dT anchor primer (Sigma) as described58 with

387

primers found in Table 4. NGS analysis was performed as described previously59 with minor

388

modifications. In short, reads were trimmed from PCR primer sequences at the 5’ end by Cutadapt60 to

389

remove the bias of the 5 overlapping amplicons. Next, reads were mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1

390

reference sequence. Subsequently, consensus and low frequency SNPs and indel calling was

391

performed.

Immunostaining of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell cultures. Following different assays, 96-well plates

393

with confluent cell layers were fixed and virus was inactivated by immersion in 100% methanol

394

(MERCK) for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20),

395

followed by incubation with 3% H2O2 for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity and washed

396

twice with PBST. Cells were then incubated with primary antibody SARS-CoV-2 spike chimeric

397

monoclonal antibody (Sino Biological #40150-D004) diluted 1:5000 in PBS with 1% bovine serum

398

albumin and 0.2% skim milk powder (PBSK) overnight at 4 ℃. Afterwards, cells were washed twice

399

with PBST followed by 1-hour incubation with secondary antibody F(ab')2-Goat anti-Human IgG Fc

400

Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, HRP (Invitrogen #A24476) diluted 1:2000 in PBSK. Cells were

401

washed twice with PBST, single infected cells were visualized with DAB substrate (Immunologic #

402

BS04-110) and counted automatically by an ImmunoSpot series 5 UV analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH),

403

as previously described for the forming-focus unit assays developed to study HCV in culture61,62.

404

Example of the immunostaining experiments output (images) can be seen in Figures 1d and 2c.

Treatment assays. Antivirals were obtained from Acme Bioscience and reconstituted in DMSO. For

406

each drug tested, cytotoxicity assays were performed in the different cell types studied, using the Cell

407

Titer AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay, Promega). The 50% cytotoxic

408

concentration (CC50, µM) was calculated by regression analysis. In brief, cells were seeded in 96-well

409

plates and drug dilutions were added the next day, in triplicates. At 72-hr post-infection, the MTS

410

reagent was added, and absorbance was measured after 1 hour incubation at 37°C. Results of treated

411

well were normalized to non-treated controls and the percentage of cell viability was plotted against the

conducted at non-cytotoxic concentrations (defined as cell viability ≥80%).

415

To explore the overall antiviral activity of drug candidates (drug potency), cells were seeded in 96-well

plates and the next day, 50 µL of virus (at a specific MOI that led to a robust infection of all non-

417

treated control wells, depending on the cell type) and 50 µL of drug (different concentrations as

indicated) were added and the cells were incubated for 72 hr. After the 72-hr incubation, plates were

processed for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein immunostaining as described above. The analysis was performed

420

by counting the number of antigen-positive cells which were then normalized to non-treated controls

(after subtraction of the background levels obtained from non-infected wells), and EC50 (effective

Table 1. Sequence comparison between the Wuhan-Hu-1 and DK-AHH1 isolates. The near

509

complete SARS-CoV-2 virus genome was sequenced by NGS from 5 overlapping RT-PCR amplicons

510

using a cut-off of 5%, and changes over the cut-off in one sample are shown; to obtain the complete

511

sequence the 5’ and 3’ termini were determined by Sanger sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons.

512

Differences are shown as nucleotide position (number) according to the reference sequence of the

513

Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (genbank NC045512.2), followed by the specific nucleotide in the reference

514

sequence and in the DK-AHH1 isolate. Original swab refers to the sequence from the patient diagnosed

515

with SARS-CoV-2. The P2VeroE6 virus refers to the stock of the second passage in Vero E6 cells. The

516

frequency of the changes in the sequences of the two analyzed viruses (percentage of the reads) is

517

shown in the next two columns. Sequence identity is represented by a dot. Nucleotide sequences were

518

translated in silico, and if the nucleotide changes led to a substitution the corresponding amino acid is

519

indicated (original amino acid->new amino acid). Synonymous changes are represented with a dash “-

520

“. The genomic region for each change is also indicated.

531

For each compound, the antiviral activity in Huh7.5, Calu-1 or A549 cells is indicated by EC50 values

532

(µM). These values were inferred from concentration-response curves as shown in Figure 4. All

533

compounds were tested at non-cytotoxic concentrations as described in Materials and Methods. For

534

remdesivir the maximum concentration tested was 10 µM. For EID-2801 the maximum concentration

535

tested was 50 µM. “>50” indicates that the maximum concentration tested was 50 µM and that no viral

536

inhibition tending towards or reaching 50% was observed at this concentration. The maximum

537

concentration tested for galidesivir was 100 µM (since clear inhibitory effects were observed at 50 µM

538

and 100 µM was non-cytotoxic).
