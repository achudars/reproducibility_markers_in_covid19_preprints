ABSTRACT
All coronaviruses (CoVs) contain a macrodomain, also termed Mac1, in non-structural

19

protein 3 (nsp3) which binds and hydrolyzes ADP-ribose covalently attached to proteins. Despite

20

several reports demonstrating that Mac1 is a prominent virulence factor, there is still a limited

21

understanding of its cellular roles during infection. Currently, most of the information regarding

22

the role of CoV Mac1 during infection is based on a single point mutant of a highly conserved

23

asparagine-to-alanine mutation, which is known to largely eliminate Mac1 ADP-

24

ribosylhydrolase activity. To determine if Mac1 ADP-ribose binding separately contributes to

25

CoV replication, we compared the replication of a murine hepatitis virus (MHV) Mac1 mutant

26

predicted to dramatically reduce ADP-ribose binding, D1329A, to the previously mentioned

27

asparagine mutant, N1347A. D1329A and N1347A both replicated poorly in bone-marrow

28

derived macrophages (BMDMs), were inhibited by PARP enzymes, and were highly attenuated

29

in vivo. However, D1329A was significantly more attenuated than N1347A in all cell lines tested

30

that were susceptible to MHV infection. In addition, D1329A retained some ability to block IFN-

31

β transcript accumulation compared to N1347A, indicating that these two mutants impacted

32

distinct Mac1 functions. Mac1 mutants predicted to eliminate both binding and hydrolysis

33

activities were unrecoverable, suggesting that the combined activities of Mac1 may be essential

34

for MHV replication. We conclude that Mac1 has multiple roles in promoting the replication of

35

MHV, and that these results provide further evidence that Mac1 could be a prominent target for

36

anti-CoV therapeutics.

IMPORTANCE
In the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been a surge to better understand how

39

CoVs replicate, and to identify potential therapeutic targets that could mitigate disease caused by

40

SARS-CoV-2 and other prominent CoVs. The highly conserved macrodomain, also termed

41

Mac1, is a small domain within non-structural protein 3. It has received significant attention as a

42

potential drug target as previous studies demonstrated that it is essential for CoV pathogenesis in

43

multiple animal models of infection. However, the various roles and functions of Mac1 during

44

infection remain largely unknown. Here, utilizing recombinant Mac1 mutant viruses, we have

45

determined that different biochemical functions of Mac1 have distinct roles in the replication of

46

MHV, a model CoV. These results indicate that Mac1 is more important for CoV replication

47

than previously appreciated, and could help guide the development of inhibitory compounds that

48

target unique regions of this protein domain.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are of the family Coronaviridae in the Nidovirales order and are

52

responsible for a variety of diseases of both clinical and veterinary significance. These diseases

53

range from potentially lethal human respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory

54

syndrome (SARS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV; to

55

mammalian gastrointestinal diseases such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and avian

56

respiratory diseases such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (1). There exists few vaccines or

57

broad-spectrum therapeutics to prevent and treat CoV-induced disease. As SARS-CoV-2

58

continues to be a significant health threat, and as there will likely be further CoV outbreaks in the

59

future, there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the mechanisms used by CoVs to

60

promote their replication and cause severe disease.

61

Like other members of the Nidovirales order, CoV genetic information is stored as non-

62

segmented, positive-sense RNA ranging in size from 26-32 kb, making them members of the

63

class of RNA viruses containing the largest genomes. These genomes can be broken down into

64

the region encoding structural and accessory proteins, comprising approximately 10 kb at the 3’

65

end of the genome, and the region encoding non-structural proteins (nsps), consisting of

66

approximately 20 kb at the 5’ end of the genome. Conserved structural proteins include the

67

spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Accessory proteins have important roles

68

in viral pathogenesis, such as antagonism of the type 1 IFN antiviral response, but are not

69

essential for in vitro viral replication. The nsps are translated into a long polyprotein and are

70

responsible for the virus’ genomic and sub-genomic RNA synthesis. The nsps perform a variety

71

of functions, and include the polymerase, helicase, 2 proteases, and many others. However, the

72

function of many nsps are still being fully determined or remain completely unknown. The

73

largest nonstructural protein, nsp3, contains several modular domains including a ubiquitin-like

74

domain, an acidic domain, one or two papain-like protease (PLP) domains, multiple

75

transmembrane domains, and one or more macrodomains (1, 2).

76

Macrodomains are globular protein domains present in many different life forms,

77

including humans, yeast, bacteria, and several families of positive-sense RNA viruses. They have

78

a highly conserved “sandwich” structure that includes several central β-sheets surrounded by 3 α-

79

helices on each side (3, 4). The primary biochemical functions of macrodomains are to bind and

80

hydrolyze ADP-ribose from proteins. There are additional macrodomains (Mac2/Mac3) in some

81

CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, that do not bind ADP-ribose and instead bind to nucleic acids or

82

cellular proteins to promote virus replication (5-11).

83

ADP-ribosylation is the posttranslational covalent addition of ADP-ribose to proteins by

84

ADP-ribosyltransferases that utilize NAD+ as a substrate. ADP-ribose can be added to proteins

85

as single subunits (mono-ADP-ribosylation or MAR) or as chains of multiple subunits (poly-

86

ADP-ribosylation or PAR). This process is performed intracellularly by poly-ADP-ribose

87

polymerases (PARPs), also known as diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTDs).

88

There are 17 human PARPs with PARP-1 being the most well-studied, as it mediates most of the

89

PARylation that occurs in the cell. Much less is known about the MARylating PARPs, though

90

many of them are interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) and some have demonstrated anti-viral

91

activities (12). For example, PARP12-mediated ADP-ribosylation impedes the replication of

92

Zika virus by ADP-ribosylating NS1 and NS3, leading to their proteasomal degradation (13).

93

PARP activity is countered by several dePARylating or deMARylating enzymes, including

94

PARGs (polyADP-ribose glycohydrolase), ARHs (ADP-ribosylhydrolases), and macrodomains

95

(14).

96

Recombinant viruses mutated at a highly conserved asparagine residue in the primary

97

CoV macrodomain (herein referred to as Mac1) have been engineered for multiple CoVs to

98

understand the role of Mac1 during infection. This residue was targeted because its mutation to

99

alanine had eliminated Mac1 phosphatase activity, was later shown to eliminate ADP-

100

ribosylhydrolase activity, and is completely conserved amongst all enzymatically active

101

macrodomains (15-18). Structurally, it is positioned to provide critical hydrogen bonds with the

102

terminal ribose, positioning the ADP-ribose for hydrolysis (15, 19, 20). Recombinant viruses

103

with this mutation generally replicate normally in tissue culture cells, but are highly attenuated in

104

vivo (16, 21-23). These reports have established Mac1 as a prominent virulence factor and

105

potential therapeutic target (4). For instance, the SARS-CoV Mac1 mutant virus, N1040A,

106

replicates poorly in mice and induces an increased IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine response

107

in mice and Calu-3 cells, a bronchial epithelial cell line. (16). These results demonstrated that

108

Mac1 is required for the ability of SARS-CoV to fully inhibit IFN and cytokine induction.

109

Similar results were observed following infection of bone-marrow derived macrophages

110

(BMDMs) with the JHM strain of MHV (JHMV) containing the same asparagine-to-alanine

111

mutation (N1347A) in Mac1 (19, 23). We also found that treatment with PARP inhibitors or

112

siRNAs targeting PARP12 or PARP14 enhanced the replication of N1347A. These results

113

demonstrated that the CoV nsp3 Mac1 domain is required to prevent PARP-mediated inhibition

114

of virus replication (23).

115

While these studies have provided significant insight into the role of the CoV Mac1

116

domain, they are largely based on a single asparagine-to-alanine mutation. As this mutation may

117

more significantly impact enzymatic activity than ADP-ribose binding, it remains unclear

118

whether the ADP-ribose binding ability of Mac1 may have additional roles in CoV replication.

119

ADP-ribose can be covalently bound to a number of different amino acids, including acidic,

120

basic, serine, and cysteine residues, while macrodomains have only been shown to hydrolyze

121

ADP-ribose attached to acidic residues. Previous studies on the alphavirus macrodomains

122

showed that mutations separating the ADP-ribose binding and hydrolase activities result in

123

distinct phenotypes during virus infection (24, 25). These results indicate that macrodomain

124

binding to ADP-ribosylated proteins with ADP-ribose attached at non-cleavable residues, such as

125

serine, may have functions distinct from its ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity.

126

Here, we created recombinant JHMV with two distinct mutations that are predicted to

127

impact Mac1 ADP-ribose binding. We found that a D1329A mutant, predicted to abrogate ADP-

128

ribose binding, had more severe replication defects in cell culture than N1347A but mostly

129

retained its ability to block IFN production when compared to N1347A. PARP inhibitors

130

enhanced the replication of D1329A, and NAD enhancing compounds further decreased its

131

replication, indicating that the defects of this virus was due to PARP activity. Finally, we failed

132

to recover a recombinant virus containing both the D1329A and N1437A mutants, or a separate

133

mutant predicted to have diminished ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activity, G1439V,

134

suggesting that the combined activities of Mac1 are essential for JHMV replication.

RESULTS
Structure of the JHMV Mac1 ADP-ribose binding pocket. As there is no published

138

structure for the MHV Mac1, we used computer modeling to predict its overall structure and the

139

structure of its ADP-ribose binding pocket (Fig. 1A-B). Not surprisingly, the structure of the

140

MHV Mac1 protein is similar to other CoV Mac1 proteins (Fig. 1C-D). One residue predicted to

141

impact ADP-ribose binding is a highly conserved aspartic acid residue located in a loop region

142

between β2 and α1 of MHV Mac1 (D22) (Fig. 1A-B, E-F). This residue is known to either make

143

a critical hydrogen bond with the N6 nitrogen of the adenine ring or mediate water contacts with

144

this molecule (Fig. 1B) (15, 20, 26, 27). Its position in the ADP-ribose binding pocket is well

145

conserved and largely superimposes with that of the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV Mac1

146

proteins (Fig. 1E-F). Mutation of this aspartic acid in multiple macrodomains virtually eliminates

147

ADP-ribose binding, but maintains some ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity (16, 28, 29). Therefore,

148

determining the role of this residue in virus replication and pathogenesis may provide unique

149

insight into the functions of Mac1. Another residue of interest is an asparagine located in a loop

150

between β7 and α6 of MHV Mac1 (N156) (Fig. 1A-B, E-F). This residue is mostly conserved

151

amongst β-CoVs, and in our MHV-1 modeled structure it appears to provide hydrogen bonds to

152

the proximal ribose. It has also been proposed to provide similar interactions in the SARS-CoV

153

and MERS-CoV Mac1 proteins (20, 26). This residue is often found as a hydrophobic amino

154

acid in other CoV and viral macrodomains, including phenylalanine in SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 (30).

155

These side chains appear to be in close contact with the adenine base and may stack against the

156

adenine ring to create water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the proximal ribose (31). Based on

157

these observations, we hypothesized that alanine mutations at these residues would provide

158

further insight into the role of Mac1 ADP-ribose binding in CoV replication and pathogenesis.

159

The MHV Mac1 D1329A virus is highly attenuated in all cell types tested, while

160

N1465A replicates like WT virus. To test the role of the D22 (D1329 in pp1a) and N156

161

(N1465 in pp1a) residues in the context of MHV replication, we first engineered recombinant

162

JHMV BACs containing the D1329A and N1465A mutations using a two-step Red

163

recombination with the endonuclease I-SceI as previously described (22, 32). These recombinant

164

viruses, termed D1329A and N1465A, were easily recovered and replicated in cell culture.

165

Following reconstitution of virus, we sequenced the Mac1 region and confirmed that these

166

mutations had been retained following passaging.

167

We first compared the replication of D1329A and N1465A with that of WT and N1347A

168

viruses in BMDMs. We previously showed that N1347A had significantly decreased replication

169

in BMDMs, and initially hypothesized that D1329A and N1465A would be similarly affected.

170

While WT and N1465A viruses were able to replicate to similar levels at all time points,

171

N1347A and D1329A were highly attenuated, showing a greater than 1-log replication defect

172

throughout the infection (Fig. 2A). We next tested the replication of D1329A and N1465A on

173

17Cl-1 fibroblasts, a common cell line that is highly permissive for MHV replication. As

174

expected, N1347A replicated like WT virus in these cells, as did N1465A, but surprisingly

175

D1329A replicated poorly in these cells with a replication defect of ~1-log (Fig. 2B-C) and

176

produced reduced levels of viral nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein (Fig. 2D). To confirm

177

that this defect was not due to a second-site mutation in the BAC, we repaired this mutation to

178

create the BAC clone, repD1329. The virus recovered from this BAC clone replicated well and

179

produced viral proteins at WT virus levels in 17Cl-1 cells, confirming that the replication defect

180

was due to mutation of D1329 (Fig. 2C-D).

181

Next, we tested whether D1329A was defective in additional MHV susceptible cells. In

182

both L929 fibroblasts and DBTs (delayed brain tumor), an astrocytoma cell line, D1329A was

183

highly attenuated with replication defects of approximately 2-logs, and very little N and S

184

protein accumulated in both cell types compared to WT virus (Fig. 2E-H). Interestingly, we

185

found that N1347A also replicated poorly and produced reduced N and S protein in DBT cells,

186

though it replicated better than D1329A (Fig. 2G-H).

187

The MHV Mac1 D1329A virus mostly retains the ability to repress IFN production

188

in BMDMs. The dramatic reduction in replication of D1329A could indicate that it had lost all

189

ADP-ribose binding and hydrolase activity, while N1347A maintains at least partial activity for

190

one or both of these functions. Alternatively, D1329A may primarily impact ADP-ribose binding

191

while N1347A primarily affects Mac1 enzymatic activity. Current biochemical data based on

192

analyses of similar macrodomains favor the latter hypothesis. Previous reports have found that

193

the aspartic acid mutation leads to complete or nearly complete loss of binding but these mutants

194

retained some hydrolase activity. In contrast, the asparagine mutation leads to the near complete

195

loss of Mac1 hydrolysis activity but had only a 2 to 3-fold reduction in ADP-ribose binding (16,

196

25, 28, 29, 33).

197

To further test these opposing hypotheses, we measured the level of IFN-β mRNA at 6

198

and 12 hpi in BMDMs infected with WT, N1347A, D1329A, and N1465A. We previously found

199

that N1347A infection led to a >1-log increase in IFN-β transcript levels in BMDMs (23). We

200

predicted that if D1329A had less overall activity compared to N1347A, its infection would lead

201

to an equivalent or greater increase in IFN-β transcript levels than N1347A. However, we might

202

expect the D1329A mutant infected cells to have reduced IFN-β transcript levels compared to

203

N1347A infected cells if hydrolysis was primarily responsible for blocking IFN production.

204

Here, infection with N1347A resulted in a >19-fold increase in IFN-β mRNA levels at 12 hpi

205

and a smaller difference at 6 hpi (Fig. 3A), consistent with our previous report. N1465A-infected

206

cells had similar IFN-β transcript levels to those infected with WT virus, further indicating that

207

this mutation does not affect Mac1 function. However, instead of observing further increases of

208

IFN-β mRNA following D1329A infection, we found that IFN-β mRNA levels in BMDMs were

209

reduced 3.5-fold when compared to N1347A, despite having roughly the same level of viral

210

genomic RNA (gRNA) in the cells in this specific experiment (Fig. 3A-B). These results indicate

211

that D1329A retains some ability to block IFN-β transcription, and thus likely has more, and not

212

less, ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity than N1347A. These results, in combination with results in

213

Fig. 2, suggests that Mac1 utilizes multiple mechanisms to promote virus replication and block

214

innate immune responses in cell culture.

215

PARP inhibitors significantly enhance the replication of MHV D1329A, while

216

boosting the PARP substrate NAD+ with nicotinamide riboside further inhibits D1329A

217

replication. The D1329 residue is known to be critical for ADP-ribose binding from multiple

218

studies (28, 29), however it is also conceivable that this mutation could affect other functions of

219

the CoV macrodomain, such as Papain-Like Protease (PLPro) binding (34). To address this

220

possibility, we treated cells with inhibitors that target host PARP enzymes. If the ADP-

221

ribosyltransferase activity of PARP enzymes are restricting the replication of D1329A, we would

222

expect to see at least partial restoration of virus replication in the presence of PARP inhibitors, as

223

we previously showed with N1347A (23). First, we performed MTT assays to confirm that the

224

PARP inhibitors XAV-939 and Olaparib (2281) did not affect the metabolic capacity of BMDMs

225

or 17Cl-1 cells. BMDM and 17Cl-1 cells were treated with XAV-939 and 2281 for 24 hrs and

226

MTT levels were measured. Neither compound resulted in notable metabolic changes at the

11

227

working concentration of 10 μM (Fig. 4A-B). In virus replication experiments, both compounds

228

significantly enhanced the replication of D1329A in BMDMs and in 17Cl-1 cells, by

229

approximately 5 and 3-fold, respectively, but had no effect on WT virus (Fig. 4C-D). In addition,

230

the level of enhanced replication in BMDMs for D1329A was similar to that of N1347A. These

231

results indicate that PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation inhibits the replication of D1329A.

232

To provide further evidence for PARP-mediated inhibition of D1329A, we hypothesized

233

that increasing PARP activity using nicotinamide riboside chloride (NR) would lead to further

234

reduction in D1329A replication. NR enhances PARP activity by increasing the intracellular

235

levels of the PARP substrate, NAD+ (35, 36). We recently showed that NAD levels are depleted

236

following MHV infection, and that restoring NAD levels with NR and other NAD boosting

237

compounds both increased PARP activity and decreased the replication of N1347A (37). We first

238

confirmed that NR did not significantly decrease the metabolic activity of BMDM or 17Cl-1

239

cells at and above the working concentration of 100 μM (Fig. 5A-B). Rather than decreasing

240

metabolic activity, 17Cl-1 cells treated with NR seemed to have slightly increased metabolic

241

activity, though this was not statistically significant (Fig. 5B). For the infection, we pretreated

242

these cells with NR for 4 hrs, then infected them with WT and D1329A, added fresh NR after the

243

infection and then collected both cell-free and cell-associated virus at 20 hpi. Similar to our

244

results with N1347A, we found that NR significantly reduced the replication of D1329A virus in

245

both cell types by >5-fold, but had no impact on WT virus (Fig. 5C-D). These results indicate

246

that NR enhanced PARP activity that further reduced D1329A virus replication, but was

247

countered by Mac1 in WT virus infected cells.

culture may not mimic what happens in vivo, we tested the effect of these mutations in mice,

where WT JHMV causes a lethal encephalitis (22, 38). We infected C57BL/6 mice with

recombinant WT, N1347A, and N1465A JHMV at 3×104 PFU and monitored weight loss as a

clinical sign of disease progression (Fig. 6A-B). N1347A was included as an attenuated control

253

virus as it was previously shown to cause minimal disease in B6 mice (22). We hypothesized that

254

N1465A would cause disease similar to WT virus, as all cell culture experiments indicated that

255

this mutation had not affected Mac1 function. Indeed, N1465A infected mice lost weight and

256

were euthanized due to severe disease at nearly the same rate as WT infected mice, while

257

N1347A did not cause any weight loss and all mice survived its infection (Fig. 6A-B). These

258

results provide further evidence that mutation of N1465 does not significantly affect the function

259

of Mac1.

260

Next, we infected mice with 3×103 PFU of WT and D1329A virus. This low dose was

261

used because titers of the D1329A virus stocks were significantly lower than other viruses.

262

Regardless, WT virus still caused significant weight loss and the infected mice succumbed to this

263

infection at roughly the same rate as did those receiving the higher dose of virus. Interestingly,

264

the D1329A virus did lead to weight loss and lethality in 5 out of 7 male mice and 1 out of 6

265

female mice (Fig. 6C-D). Since this result was unexpected, we collected the brains of 1 female

266

and 2 male mice that succumbed to infection with D1329A and sequenced the Mac1 region of

267

the MHV genome. We found that in 2 of the 3 mice, the alanine reverted back to aspartic acid,

268

while in the third mouse there were 2 second-site mutations in the N-terminus of the

269

macrodomain, L1313V and K1327E (Fig. 6E). As all mice sequenced had reverted virus, it

270

appears that D1329A replicates poorly in vivo and is especially prone to reversion. We conclude

271

that D1329A is highly attenuated in vivo.

272

Recombinant JHMV with mutations predicted to impact both ADP-ribose binding

273

and hydrolysis are not recoverable. To further test the hypothesis that Mac1 has multiple roles

274

in virus replication, we created a D1329A/N1347A double mutant BAC clone. We hypothesized

275

that if the D1329 residue confers a unique role in virus replication when compared to N1347,

276

then a double-mutant virus may be even more attenuated than either single mutant. Consistent

277

with this hypothesis, we were unable to recover the D1329A/N1347A virus following 12

278

transfection attempts from 2 separate BAC clones. Each of these experiments included

279

successful transfections of other BACs as positive controls (Table 1).

280

Introducing multiple mutations into the macrodomain could disrupt its structure and thus

281

the inability to recover this virus could be due to impairment of additional nsp3 functions outside

282

of Mac1. To provide further evidence that the loss of Mac1 function is lethal for JHMV, we

283

engineered an additional mutant, G1439V into our JHMV BAC clone. This mutation has

284

previously been introduced into SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 recombinant Mac1 proteins, and

285

both proteins had minimal, if any, ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity (16, 39). Furthermore,

286

computational modeling of an ADP-ribose bound structure of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

287

Mac1 proteins found that ADP-ribose binding was highly unfavorable when introducing the G-V

288

mutation, with a ddG of binding of ~9 and 10 rosetta energy units (REUs), respectively. After

289

transfection, we only recovered this virus 4/11 times for a 37% recovery rate (Table 1). Upon

290

sequencing the recovered viruses, we found that most had reverted to WT virus. However, one

291

clone instead had evolved a second site mutation of alanine to threonine in the residue

292

immediately upstream of V1439. To determine if this mutation was responsible for the ability of

293

this virus to replicate, we created a A1438T/G1439V mutant BAC clone. We were able to easily

294

recover this virus, indicating that this mutation was the reverting mutation that allowed the

14

295

outgrowth of one of the G1439V viruses (Table 1). A1438T/G1439V replicated better than

296

D1329A on L929 cells, but had a 3-fold replication defect and produced less viral protein on

297

L929 cells compared to WT virus (Fig. 7A-B). It also did not cause severe disease in mice,

298

indicating this mutation only partially recovered Mac1 functions (Fig. 7C-D). In total, we have

299

created two separate Mac1 recombinant JHMV clones (D1329A/N1347V and G1439V) that

300

were not recoverable without second site or reverting mutations. These results suggest that the

301

combined ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis activities of Mac1 are essential for JHMV

302

replication.

303
304
305

DISCUSSION
Here we show that the JHMV Mac1 protein domain promotes virus replication in

306

multiple ways, likely by utilizing both its ADP-ribose binding and ADP-ribosylhyrolase

307

activities. Based on prior reports demonstrating the importance of Mac1 for CoV pathogenesis,

308

there has been particular interest in developing therapeutic strategies targeting the SARS-CoV-2

309

Mac1 domain. (16, 31, 39-44). These results further demonstrate the importance of Mac1 for

310

CoV replication and could have implications in the design of compounds targeting the ADP-

311

ribose binding domain of Mac1.

312

Previous studies of the alphavirus macrodomain has provided unique insight into the

313

separate binding and enzymatic activities of these protein domains (24, 25, 29, 45). Chikungunya

314

(CHIKV) and Sindbis virus mutations that impact these activities are highly attenuated in cell

315

culture and in vivo. In fact, CHIKV macrodomain mutations that reduced hydrolysis activity by

316

as little as 25% are attenuated, and any mutation that eliminated binding activity was

317

unrecoverable (29). In addition, two mutants were further analyzed for their impact on the virus

15

318

replication cycle, G32S (reduced hydrolysis and binding) and Y114A (decreased hydrolysis but

319

increased binding). While both mutants had reduced virus replication as measured by plaque

320

assay, the G32S mutant had greatly reduced levels of viral RNA and protein production early in

321

the infection, while Y114A had normal levels of viral RNA and protein until later stages of

322

infection. It was concluded that a CHIKV with ADP-ribose binding defects is unable to properly

323

initiate replication, while a hydrolase deficiency negatively affects the later stages of virus

324

replication.

325

To determine if there may be additional phenotypes associated with the ADP-ribose

326

binding ability of the CoV Mac1, we chose to mutate residues in the adenine binding pocket.

327

First, we targeted N1465, located in a loop between β7 and α6, which appears to provide a

328

hydrogen bond with the proximal ribose (Fig. 1B). Despite its apparent ability to provide

329

interactions with the proximal ribose (20, 26), we found that mutation of this residue to alanine

330

had no impact on JHMV replication in any cell type we tested (Fig. 2), and also did not affect the

331

ability of JHMV to cause disease in mice (Fig. 6A-B). From these results we conclude that

332

N1465 does not contribute significantly to the ability of the JHMV Mac1 to promote replication

333

or cause disease.

334

Next, we targeted a conserved aspartic acid that makes a critical hydrogen bond with the

335

N7 nitrogen of the adenine base, D1329. While D1329 behaved similarly to N1347A in

336

BMDMs, it was substantially attenuated in multiple cell lines, including 17Cl-1, L929, and DBT

337

cells. Importantly N1347A replicates normally, or with only modest defects in these cells,

338

suggesting that D1329 contributes to virus replication in a unique manner compared to N1347.

339

This is consistent with biochemical data from other macrodomains that demonstrates that the D-

340

A mutation leads to dramatic loss of ADP-ribose binding, while the asparagine mutation only

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.30.437796; this version posted March 31, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

341

results in a 2-3-fold loss of ADP-ribose binding (25, 28, 29). In mice we found that D1329A

342

often reverted. While in some cases it had reverted to WT, in one case two novel mutations near

343

D1329, L1313V and K1327E appeared. Both residues are found outside of the position of the

344

aspartic acid though not in near contact with the substrate (data not shown), making it unclear if

345

and how either of these amino acid changes helped enhance the replication of D1329A in vivo.

346

However, it is possible that the D1329A mutation could have significantly affected the structure

347

in this region of Mac1, causing a rearrangement of these residues. It will be of interest to

348

determine if one or both of these mutations can help restore ADP-ribose binding activity and

349

virus replication of this mutant.

350

In addition, we have shown that the defect of D1329 is due to PARP-dependent ADP-

351

ribosylation and not an additional Mac1 function. PARP inhibitors increased D1329A replication

352

in 17Cl-1 and BMDMs (Fig. 4), and NR, which increases levels of the PARP substrate NAD+,

353

further decreased its replication in these cell types (Fig. 5) (35-37). From these results it is likely

354

that ADP-ribose binding is a critical component of MHV replication. In contrast, D1329A did

355

not induce IFNβ transcript levels to the same degree as N1347A, which indicates that this virus

356

retains some function that is lost with N1347A. A logical explanation is that ADP-

357

ribosylhydrolase activity is responsible for Mac1 inhibition of IFNβ transcript levels, and that

358

N1347A has lost most, if not all of this enzyme activity while D1329A retains at least some

359

hydrolase activity. This is consistent with biochemical data of other CoV Mac1 mutant proteins

360

showing that the N-A mutation largely ablates hydrolase activity while the D-A mutant retains

361

some hydrolase activity (15, 16, 18, 25, 29).

362

Interestingly, we were unable to recover a double mutant virus (D1329A/N1347A) or a

363

separate mutant designed to negatively impact both binding and hydrolase activities (G1439V).

17

364

These results indicate that the combined activities of Mac1 may be essential for JHMV

365

replication. Intriguingly, we identified a second site mutation for G1439V in an immediately

366

adjacent residue, A1438T, that allowed it to replicate. Of note, all alphaviruses have a threonine

367

in this position. Based on computer modeling, we predict that this mutation may affect the

368

network of water molecules in the vicinity of these residues and could potentially improve either

369

the ADP-ribose binding or hydrolysis activity of Mac1 (Fig. 7C-D). After recreating an isogenic

370

BAC clone with these two mutations, A1438T/G1439V, we found that this clone was easily

371

recoverable and replicated in cell culture, though it had a mild replication defect compared to

372

WT virus in L929 cells and was attenuated in vivo. Regardless, these results confirmed that this

373

mutation allowed us to recover the G1439V mutant virus and provided even more evidence that

374

Mac1 is a potential therapeutic target for CoVs. Mac1 could be targeted by: i) using inhibitors

375

specific to the macrodomain; ii) enhancing PARP activity by increasing NAD+ levels by

376

consumption of NR; or iii) a combination of both.

377

The primary challenge remaining is to identify targets of Mac1 that contribute to the

378

inhibition of Mac1 mutant viruses. Macrodomain proteins have only been demonstrated to

379

remove ADP-ribose from acidic residues (4), and several PARPs that are induced by virus

380

infection ADP-ribosylate acidic residues (29, 46). But recent proteomic analyses have shown that

381

in certain conditions, ADP-ribosylation of acidic residues is rare or even absent (47). Thus, it’s

382

likely that viral macrodomains would also target proteins modified at non-acidic residues such as

383

serine, cysteine, or lysine, even if they cannot hydrolyze these ADP-ribose modifications. Mac1

384

binding to this modification may dramatically impact the biochemical activities of its target

385

proteins, for instance, by altering protein-protein interactions. While Mac1 is likely to target both

386

cellular and viral proteins during infection, the severe and universal defect of D1329A indicates

18

387

that its binding activity may target an ADP-ribosylated CoV protein. We recently found that the

388

CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is ADP-ribosylated. Interestingly, this modification was

389

unchanged following infection with N1347A, indicating it is not cleaved by the macrodomain

390

but may be a target for macrodomain binding (48). Regardless, further investigation into how

391

PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation impacts the function of viral and cellular proteins is likely to

392

uncover unique insights into the replication of CoVs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

395

Molecular modeling of the MHV Mac1 protein. A model of MHV Mac1 protein bound to

396

ADP-ribose was generated using RosettaCM (49), using the ADP-ribose bound MERS-CoV

397

Mac1 structure, 5DUS, as a template (20). Following the threading step, the pose of ADP-ribose

398

bound to the MERS-CoV macrodomain was included in the refinement process to create a model

399

of the MHV Mac1 protein bound to ADP-ribose. The top scoring model was aligned to the

400

MERS Mac1 protein, and three structural waters that participate in hydrogen bond networks

401

bridging the protein to ADP-ribose (water residues 312, 365, and 384) were added to the MHV

402

model, followed by hydrogen bond optimization and minimization within Maestro by

403

Schrodinger.

404

Rosetta Cartesian ddG calculations. The structures of the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV Mac1

405

proteins bound to ADP-ribose, 5DUS (20) and 2FAV (15) respectively, were stripped of all

406

waters but the three structural waters bridging the macrodomain to ADP-ribose (20). These

407

structures, as well as the model of the MHV bound to ADP-ribose and the three waters, were

408

prepared for ddG prediction by relaxing into cartesian space using coordinate restraints via

409

Rosetta (50). The lowest energy structure was selected for ddG prediction of the G1439V mutant

410

using Rosetta’s cartesian ddG protocol (51). By default, cartesian ddG protocol runs for three

411

iterations for the wild type and G1439V proteins, and the predicted ddG was taken as the

412

difference between the wildtype and the mutant for the average of the three simulations.

with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, HEPES, sodium

419

pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, and L-glutamine. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs)

420

sourced from WT mice were differentiated by incubating cells in Roswell Park Memorial Institute

421

(RPMI) media supplemented with 10% L929 cell supernatants, 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml

422

penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and L-glutamine in for seven days. Cells were washed and

423

replaced with fresh media every day after the 4th day.

424

Cell viability assay. BMDMs and 17Cl-1 cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 24 hours.

425

Cellular metabolic activity was assessed using a Vybrant MTT Cell Proliferation Assay (Thermo Fisher

426

Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions.

427

Mice. Pathogen-free C57BL/6 (B6) mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice

428

were bred and maintained in the animal care facility at the University of Kansas as approved by the

429

University of Kansas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) following guidelines set

430

forth in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

431

Generation of recombinant pBAC-JHMV constructs. All recombinant pBAC-JHMV constructs

432

were created using Red recombination (primers listed in Table 2). Recombinant WT (rJIA-

433

GFPrevN1347) and N1347A (rJIA-GFP-N1347A) MHV were previously described.

434

Recombinant BACs with the D1329A, G1439V, A1438T, and N1465A point mutations in the

435

nsp3 macrodomain were engineered using the Kanr-I-SceI marker cassette for dual positive and

436

negative selection as previously described, using the primers listed in Table 2 (32). BAC DNA

437

from Cmlr Kans colonies was analyzed by restriction enzyme digest, PCR, and direct sequencing

438

for isolation of correct clones. PCR and sequencing were done using the following primers

439

located just outside of the Mac1 gene sequence: F 5’-ggctgttgtggatggcaagca-3’ and R 5’-

440

gctttggtaccagcaacggag-3’. Wild-type repaired BACs were engineered by reintroducing the wild-

441

type sequence into the BAC clones containing the D1329A mutation using the same procedure as

442

described above. The resulting BAC clones were termed pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP-D1329A, pBAC-

443

JHMVIA-GFP-N1465A, pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP-D1329A/N1347A, pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP-G1439V,

444

pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP-G1439V/A1438T, and pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP-repD1329.

445

Reconstitution of recombinant pBAC-JHMV-derived virus. Approximately 1×106 BHK-

446

MVR cells were transfected with approximately 0.5-1 μg of pBAC-JHMV DNA and 1 μg of

447

pcDNA-MHV-N plasmid using Polyjet (SignaGen) as a transfection reagent. New recombinant

448

viruses used in this study were termed D1329A (rJIA-GFP-D1329A), N1465A (rJIA-GFP-

449

N1465), G1439V (rJIA-GFP-G1439V), A1438T/G1439V (rJIA-GFP- A1438T/G1439V), and

450

repD1329 (rJIA-GFP-repD1329). Virus stocks were created by infecting ~1.5×107 17Cl-1 cells at

451

an MOI of 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell and collecting both the cells and supernatant at

452

16-20 hpi. The cells were freeze-thawed, and debris was removed prior to collecting virus stocks.

453

Virus stocks were quantified by plaque assay on Hela-MHVR cells and sequenced by collecting

454

infected 17Cl-1 or L929 cells using TRIzol. RNA was isolated and cDNA was prepared using

455

MMLV-reverse transcriptase as per manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The

456

Mac1 gene sequence was amplified by PCR using the same primers as described above for

457

sequencing BACs, and then resulting PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing using

458

the forward primer. Sequence was analyzed using DNA Star software.

459

Virus infection. Cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

460

of 0.05-0.1 PFU/cell with a 45-60 min adsorption phase, unless otherwise stated. Olaparib

461

(APExBIO – Cat. #A4154) and XAV-939 (APExBIO – Cat. #A1877) were added to cells

462

following the adsorption phase at 10μM. Nicotinomide Riboside Chloride (NR) (Chromadex)

463

was added to cells at 100 μM 4 hr prior to infection and then re-added immediately following the

464

adsorption phase of the infection. Male and female mice, 5 to 8 weeks old (unless otherwise

465

indicated), were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and inoculated intranasally with either

466

3×103 or 3×104 PFU of recombinant virus in a total volume of 12 μl DMEM. To obtain viral

467

RNA from infected animals to sequence the virus following infection, mice were sacrificed, and

468

brain tissue was collected and homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated and

469

cDNA was prepared using MMLV-reverse transcriptase as per manufacturer’s instructions

470

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The macrodomain gene sequence was amplified by PCR and

471

sequenced as described above. Sequence was analyzed using DNA Star software.

472

Real-time qPCR analysis. RNA was isolated from BMDMs using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and

473

cDNA was prepared as described above. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed

474

on a QuantStudio3 real-time PCR system using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo

475

Fisher Scientific). Primers used for qPCR are listed in Table 3. Cycle threshold (CT) values were

476

normalized to the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) by the

477

following equation: CT = CT(gene of interest) - CT(HPRT). Results are shown as a ratio to HPRT

478

calculated as 2-ΔCT.

479

Immunoblotting. Total cell extracts were lysed in sample buffer containing SDS, protease and

480

phosphatase inhibitors (Roche), β-mercaptoethanol, and a universal nuclease (Fisher Scientific).

481

Proteins were resolved on an SDS polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride

482

(PVDF) membrane, hybridized with a primary antibody, reacted with an infrared (IR) dye-

483

conjugated secondary anti- body, visualized using a Li-COR Odyssey Imager (Li-COR), and

484

analyzed using Image Studio software. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting included

485

anti-MHV N monoclonal antibody (52) and anti-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC15;

486

Abcam, Inc.). Secondary IR antibodies were purchased from Li-COR.

BMDM (A), 17Cl-1 (B-D), L929 (E-F), and DBT (G-H) cells were infected with WT, N1347A,

713

D1329A, N1465A, and repD1329 viruses as described in Materials & Methods. Progeny virus

714

was collected at indicated time points and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. In

715

addition, cell lysates were collected and viral protein levels were determined by immunoblotting.

716

The data show one experiment representative of at least two independent experiments (A-C,E,G)

717

with n=4 (A) or n=3 (B,C,E,G) in each experiment. The data in (D,F,H) show one experiment

718

representative of two independent experiments.

726

B) BMDMs (A) and 17Cl-1 cells (B) were treated with indicated compounds, and at 24 hours,

727

cell viability was measured using an MTT assay as described in Materials & Methods. (C-D) WT

728

BMDMs (C) and 17Cl-1 cells (D) were infected with WT, N1347A, or D1329A, and then treated

729

with 0.25% DMSO, 10 μM Olaparib (2281), or 10 μM XAV-939 as described in Materials &

730

Methods. Progeny virus was collected at indicated time points and virus titers were determined

731

by plaque assay. The data in (A-D) show one experiment representative of two independent

732

experiments with n=4 (A,B) or n=3 (C,D) for each experiment.

Figure 5. The addition of NR, a precursor of the PARP substrate NAD+, further decreases the

734

replication of D1329A. (A-B) BMDMs (A) and 17Cl-1 cells (B) were treated with NR as

735

described above, and at 24 hours cell viability was measured using an MTT assay as described in

736

Methods. (C-D) WT BMDMs (C) and 17Cl-1 cells (D) were either mock treated (H2O) or treated

737

with NR as described in Materials & Methods. Progeny virus was collected at indicated time

738

points and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. The data in (A-D) show one experiment

739

representative of two independent experiments with n=4 (A,B) or n=3 (C,D) for each

740

experiment.

Figure 6. D1329A, but not N1465A, is highly attenuated in vivo. (A-B) WT male and female B6

742

mice were infected with 3×104 PFU of WT, N1347A, and N1465A intranasally and monitored

743

for survival and weight loss daily for 12 days. The data show the combined results of two

744

independent experiments. WT, n=5 for male and female mice; N1347A, n=5 for male and female

results of two independent experiments. WT, n=5 for male and female mice; D1329A, n=7 for

748

male and n=6 for female mice. (E) D1329A virus readily reverts in vivo. The brains of 3 mice (2

749

male (M); 1 female (F)) which succumbed to infection with D1329A were harvested and their

750

viral RNA was amplified by RT-PCR with Mac1 specific primers. The PCR product was

751

sequenced by Sanger sequencing and analyzed using DNA Star software. Mouse #1 and #3

752

reverted to wild-type virus sequence, while mouse #2 evolved 2 new mutations, L1313V &

753

K1327E.

Figure 7. The A1438T/G1439V virus, a revertant of G1439V, is recoverable but replicates at

755

slightly reduced levels compared to WT virus and is attenuated in vivo. (A-B) L929 cells were

756

infected with WT, D1329A, and AG1438/1439TV viruses as described in Materials & Methods.

757

Progeny virus was collected at 24 hpi and virus titers were determined by plaque assay. In

758

addition, cell lysates were collected at 24 hpi and viral protein levels were determined by

759

immunoblotting. The data in (A) shows one experiment representative of two independent

760

experiments with n=3 for each experiment. The data in (B) shows one experiment representative

761

of two independent experiments. (C-D) WT male B6 mice were infected with 3×103 PFU of WT

762

and A1438T/G1439V intranasally and monitored for survival (C) and weight loss (D) daily for

763

12 days. WT, n=3; A1438T/G1439V, n=6. (D-E) Rosetta predicted structures of WT MERS-

CoV Mac1 around the distal ribose compared to G128V (E) and A127T/G128V (F) proteins.

765

G128V (orange cylinders) is predicted to cause a disruption of water molecules (E) (WT – red

766

spheres; G128V or A127T/G128V – black spheres). The A127T mutation (salmon cylinders) is

767

predicted to restore this water network back to their original location (F), likely restoring critical

768

hydrogen bonds.
