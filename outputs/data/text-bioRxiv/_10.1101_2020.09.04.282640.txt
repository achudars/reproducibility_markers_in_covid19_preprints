Abstract

21

Background: Prevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection provides essential

22

information for deciding disease prevention and mitigation measures. We estimate the

23

seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in District Srinagar.

24

Methods: 2906 persons >18 years of age selected from hospital visitors across District Srinagar

25

participated in the study. We tested samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG

26

antibodies using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay-based serologic test.

27

Results: Age- and gender-standardized seroprevalence was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9% to 4.3%). Age

28

30-69 years, a recent history of symptoms of an influenza-like-illness, and a history of being

29

placed under quarantine were significantly related to higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-

30

2 specific IgG antibodies. The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two

31

weeks preceding the study, adjusted for test performance, was 32602 with an estimated (median)

32

infection-to-known-case ratio of 46 (95% CI 36 to 57).

33

Conclusions: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies is low in the District.

34

A large proportion of the population is still susceptible to the infection. A sizeable number of

35

infections remain undetected, and a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible

36

with COVID-19 are not tested.

37

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, Immunoglobulin G, Seroprevalence.

Introduction

40

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered

41

coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. The disease

42

was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and later as a global

43

pandemic by the World Health Organization [2,3]. COVID-19 presents with flu-like symptoms

44

and causes severe symptoms in some cases. As of 31st July 2020, there were over 17 million

45

reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with nearly 669 thousand deaths globally [4]. In India,

46

as of 31st July 2020, the total number of reported SARS-CoV-2 infections was over 1.6 million,

47

with more than 35 thousand deaths [4]. In District Srinagar, the first case of SARS-CoV-2

48

infection was reported on 18th March 2020. On 22nd March 2020, the Jammu and Kashmir

49

government ordered the shutdown of all non-essential activities, commercial and business

50

establishments, and educational institutions, except essential commodities and services to

51

prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection [5]. The health authorities started extensive case-

52

detection and contact-tracing activities. Case-detection was based on the testing of

53

nasopharyngeal samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

54

People with SARS-CoV-2 infection may remain asymptomatic or develop mild to severe

55

COVID-19, which may result in death. A large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections remain

56

asymptomatic and contribute to disease transmission [6,7]. Testing strategy and the number of

57

test kits available influences the detection of cases by RT-PCR. RT-PCR-based case detection

58

strategies may not provide a reasonable approximation of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections

59

in a population since they may miss many asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections. Thus,

60

an informed policy- and decision-making for control of the COVID-19 epidemic in a community

61

should not be based solely on RT-PCR-based numbers.

62

Seroprevalence surveys can provide an estimate of the proportion of the population that has

63

developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, an indication of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mild

64

and asymptomatic infections, which may not have received RT-PCR testing, can be detected.

65

Besides, assuming that antibodies provide partial or total immunity, seroprevalence surveys give

66

an estimation of the proportion of the population still susceptible to the infection. Seroprevalence

67

studies provide important complementary information to frame evidence-based strategies for

68

SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention.

69

Here, we present the results of a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in District Srinagar,

70

conducted between 1st and 15th July 2020, to estimate the prevalence of IgG antibodies against

71

SARS-CoV-2 among adults using a sensitive and specific chemiluminescent microparticle

72

immunoassay (CMIA)-based test.

73

Materials and methods

74

Study design, setting, and participants

75

We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence study in District Srinagar over two weeks from

76

1st July 2020 to 15th July 2020. District Srinagar is a city in the valley of Kashmir in northern

77

India. It has an estimated adult (>18 years) population of just over one million. Study

78

participants were adults (>18 years) who visited select hospitals across the District during the

79

study period.

81

We informed the participants of the study's purpose and procedure. We obtained written

82

informed consent from those who agreed to participate. The Institutional Ethics Committee of

83

Government Medical College Srinagar approved the study.

84

Sample size

85

We estimated the minimum sample size needed based on an anticipated seroprevalence of 2%

86

within an absolute error of 0.8% with 95% confidence. We used a design effect of 2 to adjust for

87

the nature of sampling and increased the sample size further to account for a non-response of

88

20%. The minimum sample size needed for the study was 2821. We targeted a sample size of

89

3000.

90

Selection of participants

91

There are 130 hospitals across District Srinagar which provide primary, secondary, and tertiary

92

care to the populace. We purposively selected 20 hospitals across the District so that the chosen

93

hospitals spread across all areas of the District. Furthermore, hospitals with very meager patient

94

visits (specifically, we excluded hospitals with less than 100 patient visits per month) were not

95

selected. Details about the hospitals across the District are in the supplementary material (S1

96

Data).

97

We deemed hospital-based selection of participants to be more convenient, rapid, and feasible,

98

given the constrained human resources and time available for completion of the study. Such a

99

choice could, however, lead to a non-representative sample. We made efforts to reduce this bias

100

by reporting age- and gender-standardized prevalence.

101

We invited all adult patients (>18 years) coming to the selected hospitals during the study period

102

for participation in the study.

103

Procedure

104

Consenting adults were required to answer a set of questions which included information about

105

demographic variables, self-reported history of contact with a known SARS-CoV-2 positive

106

patient, self-reported history of travel outside the valley since 1st January 2020, history of

107

symptoms suggestive of an Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) (Fever and Cough) during the two weeks

108

preceding the interview, history of an RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection and the result of such

109

a test, if done. Each participant was assigned a five-digit unique identification number.

110

Participants were interviewed by doctors who had training and experience in conducting survey

111

interviews and were specifically trained to use the EpiCollect5 platform for recording and

112

uploading the responses. EpiCollect5 is a free, mobile application-based tool which enables the

113

interviewers to record and store the participant responses offline and upload them to the

114

EpiCollect5 server from where stored data is downloaded for data analysis [8].

115

Upon completion of the interview, trained laboratory technicians (phlebotomists) collected 3-5

116

mL of venous blood from each participant under standard aseptic precautions. The blood samples

117

were immediately transferred into a red-top serum tube with a clot activator. The samples were

118

allowed to stand for at least 30 minutes for clotting to take place. Afterward, the samples were

119

centrifuged at the same hospital at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes. In case the centrifugation facility

120

was not available at the hospital, centrifugation was done at a central facility. Centrifuged blood

121

samples were transported under the cold chain to a central laboratory for further processing and

122

testing. The samples were carefully packed in designated vaccine carriers to avoid hemolysis

123

during transportation.

124

Laboratory procedure

125

We performed the test med using Fully Automated High Throughput Platform ARCHITECT

126

i1000SR Immunoassay Analyzer by Abbott Laboratories Inc[9]. Before testing, calibration was

127

performed to create assay control. Once calibration was accepted and stored, serum samples were

128

tested for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG. For quality control, a single sample of each control level was

129

tested once every 24 hours. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay uses chemiluminescent microparticle

130

immunoassay (CMIA) technology to detect IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and

131

plasma. The test has a high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (over 99.6%) for the detection of

132

SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies 17 days after infection [9,10].

133

Laboratory data entry

134

Separate EpiCollect5 forms, in duplicate, were used for entering laboratory results data. The

135

forms were independently filled by two trained personnel. Data from the two forms were

136

checked for consistency by a third person and in case of any discrepancy, the source data was

137

referred for any needed correction. The unique identification number was used to link the

138

interview information and laboratory results data.

139

Definitions used

140

Participants were labeled as “IgG positive” if the index value for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG was

141

above 1.40, as suggested by the manufacturer [9]. Else, they were labeled “IgG negative”.

142

Statistical analysis

143

For the presentation of age data, age was grouped into 20-year age intervals. The occupation was

144

categorized as ‘at-risk occupation’ and ‘low-risk occupation’ depending upon the perceived risk

145

of exposure to a known or unknown SARS-COV-2 positive case. Categorical variables were

146

summarized as frequency and percentage. Overall, unadjusted seroprevalence was reported as a

147

percentage along with its 95% confidence interval. Given the nature of participant selection, we

148

report age- and gender-standardized seroprevalence to minimize, if not nullify, the resultant bias.

149

The Sample Registration System (SRS) Statistical Report 2018 [11] provides the latest available

150

percentage distribution of the population of Jammu & Kashmir by age and gender. We used

151

figures for urban areas in the report to calculate weights for reporting age- and gender-

152

standardized seroprevalence. The details are in the supplementary material (S1 Table).

153

To identify potential factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, we used logistic

154

regression analysis and reported unadjusted and age- and gender-adjusted odds ratio with a 95%

155

confidence interval.

156

We estimated the number of infections till two weeks before the study period, i.e., 15th June 2020

157

to 30th June 2020, by applying the age- and gender-specific seroprevalence rates found in the

158

study to the projected population of the District for the year 2020 using 2011 census data [12]

159

and growth rates from the Sample Registration System (SRS) [13]. Details are in the

160

supplementary material (S2 Table).

161

Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp. 2017. Stata Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX:

162

StataCorp LLC.) was used for data analysis.

Results

164

Over the study period, 3031 eligible persons were invited for participation in the study. The

165

refusal rate was 3.6% (108/3031). Two thousand nine hundred twenty-three blood samples were

166

collected, but demographic data was missing for 17 participants. We analyzed data from 2906

167

participants (Fig. 1).

204

During the two weeks before the start of the study (15th June 2020 to 30th June 2020), the

205

estimated cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the area was 36677 (95% CI 29546-

206

43809) (S2 Table). When adjusted for sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory test kit [14],

207

the number of infections comes down to 32602 (95% CI 25470-39734) (S2 Table).

208

The cumulative number of RT-PCR confirmed cases till 15th June 2020 was 538 in District

209

Srinagar, and the number was 932 till 30th June 2020. The mid-interval (median) cumulative

210

number of RT-PCR confirmed cases in the two weeks preceding the study was 703 (Fig 2). The

211

infection-to-known-case ratio was thus between 32602/932=35 (95% CI 25470/932=27 to

212

39734/932=43) to 32602/538=61 (95% CI 25470/538=47 to 39734/538=74). The median

213

estimate of the infection-to-known-case ratio was 32602/703=46 (95% CI 25470/703=36 to

214

39734/703=57).

Discussion

219

The results of our study provide a rough estimate of the prevalence of IgG antibodies against

220

SARS-CoV-2 in District Srinagar. Nearly 3.6% of the population showed evidence of recent

221

SARS-CoV-2 infection. A large proportion of the population is, thus, still susceptible to the

222

infection. Approximately three months after reporting the first COVID-19 case, the epidemic

223

appears to be in the initial stages, and more cases of COVID-19 are expected. The number of

224

confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been on the increase ever since we completed our

225

study (Fig 2).

226

A large proportion of infections remain unknown. For every RT-PCR confirmed case, there are

227

about 46 infections in the population. This figure is higher than that reported from Switzerland

228

[15]. Interestingly, only 28% of participants in our study with COVID-19 like symptoms were

229

tested by RT-PCR (Table 2). Robust mechanisms for testing of COVID-19 suspects need to be

230

developed and implemented to decrease the number of unknown infections. Of the 111

231

participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, 97 did not report any history of

232

COVID-19 like symptoms. This finding is compatible with what we know about SARS-CoV-2

233

infections – a majority of them remain asymptomatic [6,7].

234

Several seroprevalence studies conducted across the world have reported prevalence ranging

235

from 1% in California to 23% in Delhi [15–22]. The prevalence estimates depend on the stage of

236

the epidemic in the area at the time of the study and the accuracy of the antibody detection test

237

used.

238

We used CMIA to detect SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. CMIA-based IgG tests have

239

high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection when the samples

240

have been taken two weeks after the onset of symptoms [9,23–28]. There is, however, a

241

possibility of cross-reaction with human endemic coronaviruses, which can lead to false-positive

242

results making a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by antibody detection less specific

243

[9,23,29].

244

IgG antibodies appear, on an average, 10-11 days after symptoms [15] or two weeks after

245

infection and are maintained at a high level for an extended period [24,25]. Immediately after

246

infection, the IgG titers are negative and thus do not help in the diagnosis of the infection in the

247

early stage. A combination of IgM and IgG antibody tests is more helpful [27]. Detection of

248

infection by the use of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG antibodies has several advantages. As
16

249

compared to RT-PCR based detection of infection, the antibody-based tests are cheaper and

250

faster. They also pose less danger of infection for health workers since patients may disperse the

251

virus during respiratory sampling. Also, blood samples show reduced heterogeneity compared to

252

respiratory specimens [23]. Besides, the presence of IgG antibodies gives a clue to the presence

253

of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2. However, both B and T cells may provide immune-

254

mediated protection to viral infection [26].

255

We did not find any significant difference in seroprevalence among males and females (OR 1.2,

256

95% CI 0.8-1.8) (Table 4). Similar findings have been reported elsewhere in the literature

257

[17,30]. People 30-69 years of age had a 2-3 times higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-2

258

specific IgG antibodies as compared to the young (<30 years) (Table 4). The lower

259

seroprevalence in the old (≥70 years) points to the success of social distancing measures adopted

260

by families, especially in the context of the elderly population, something the local health

261

authorities have been stressing upon given the higher chances of more severe disease among the

262

elderly. However, the possibility of immunosenescence among older adults cannot be ruled out

263

and needs further investigation [31].

264

The presence of ILI symptoms in the recent past was the factor most strongly associated with the

265

presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. People with a recent history of ILI symptoms

266

had a 3.7 times higher chance of showing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to

267

those without such history. Another factor significantly related to evidence of SARS-CoV-2

268

infection was placement under quarantine. During the first few months of the epidemic in the

269

District, the authorities placed all SARS-CoV-2 suspects and their close contacts under

270

‘administrative quarantine’ at a designated place. There is a possibility that infection in such

271

cases could be because of their contact with the primary suspect or contact during their stay at
17

272

the quarantine facility. Nevertheless, having been under quarantine almost doubled the odds of

273

SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to those who did not need such quarantine.

274

Limitations

275

The selection of study participants was not completely random, and this could have led to an

276

overestimation of the seroprevalence estimates. A random population-based selection of

277

participants was not feasible owing to the lockdown and human resource constraints in an

278

already over-burdened healthcare system. We, hopefully, reduced the bias by providing age- and

279

gender-standardized estimates, but could not nullify or estimate the bias. The low prevalence of

280

SARS-CoV-2 in our setting and the possibility of false-positive results may inflate our

281

prevalence estimates. We provide test-performance adjusted estimates of the number of

282

infections in addition to age- and gender- standardization to reduce such bias. Detection of

283

SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies and simultaneous RT-PCR could have provided a better

284

estimate of the current infection rate.

285

Conclusions

286

Our study provides estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in District Srinagar. The findings of our

287

study suggest that there are many people with unknown infection in the community. For every

288

known case, there are approximately 46 unknown infections. A sizeable number of symptomatic

289

individuals do not receive RT-PCR testing for early diagnosis. The case-detection and contact-

290

testing exercise should be intensified to allow the detection of unknown infections in the

291

community. The study findings further suggest that a large proportion of the population is still

292

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the number of cases may increase. There is a need to

ensure the availability of treatment facilities in hospitals across the District. Infection

294

surveillance measures need to be developed to devise informed public health measures.
