ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) is a respiratory infection caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China in 2019. The disease is notably
severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why
the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells
with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE)
enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution
imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of
endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to
the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell.
Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2,
producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat
diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung
tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and
the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2
localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of
COVID19 in obese patients.
chronic inflammation causes cholesterol loading
into macrophage rich tissue10. Pneumocytes in the
lung load and unload cholesterol along with
macrophages and this process is associated with
lung disease11 and lung function12,13. For further
discussion on cholesterol in peripheral tissue see
Figure S1B.

INTRODUCTION
In early 2020, COVID19 spread rapidly throughout
the developed world leading to extensive death
and an ongoing pandemic. The lethality of SARSCoV-2 is notably selective for elderly1,2 and those
with chronic disease such as hypertension,
diabetes, Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, and
smoking3,4. Interestingly, almost all children are
either asymptomatic or present with very minor
symptoms, while elderly and those with underlying
conditions experience very severe life-threatening
symptoms. This disparity was also observed with
SARS-CoV, a closely related virus which failed to
kill any children under the age of 12, despite being
much more lethal than SARS-CoV-2 in adults5.
Understanding why young people are resistant in
this class of viruses could help both healthy and
chronically ill adults to avoid severe symptoms of
COVID19.

We recently showed a cholesterol-dependent
mechanism for anesthetics that regulates the
translocation of membrane proteins between
monosialotetrahexosylganglioside1
(GM1)
containing lipid rafts and PIP2 lipid clusters14,15.
Lipid rafts (see Supplemental Figure S1A) facilitate
endocytosis, an important entry pathway for
SARS-CoV, a closely related virus to SARS-CoV216,17. SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to a
receptor angiotensinogen converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)18,19. Similar to the proteins in anesthesia,
previous experiments showed ACE2 can associate
with detergent resistant membranes (DRMs)20,21
which are similar in composition to GM1 lipid
domains. However, it is not known if this sensitivity
of ACE2 to cholesterol contributes to differences in
viral infectivity in young vs. old or those with pre-

Cholesterol is an insoluble eukaryotic lipid found in
membranes throughout the human body, most
notably in the plasma membrane6. It appears to
accumulate in tissue with age7–9. Furthermore,

existing conditions (e.g. obesity). Here we show
that lung cholesterol increases in aged diabetic
mice resulting in ACE2 trafficking to GM1 lipid rafts
and mediating efficient viral entry.
RESULTS
Cholesterol dependent SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus entry.
To test the cholesterol dependence of SARS-CoV2 on viral entry we loaded cholesterol into
HEK293T cells with apolipoprotein E (apoE) and
blood serum and treated the cells with retrovirus
pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
(SARS2-PV)22,23. A segment of the S protein binds
to the ACE2 and recapitulates viral entry. ApoE is
a cholesterol carrier protein linked to Alzheimer’s
and the severity of COVID1924. In tissue, apoE
binds to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and
facilitates loading of cholesterol into cells (Figure
1A). When apoE is in excess, it has the opposite
effect; it facilitates efflux of cholesterol from the
cell25 (Supplemental Figure S1B).

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) infection

for loading cultured cells with cholesterol. i.,

Supplemental Figure S1B). (B) SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus (SARS2-PV) entry assay. Cells were
treated with a luciferase expressing retrovirus
pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that
recapitulates viral entry. Infectivity was monitored by a
luciferase activity in cells treated with or without apoE.
Viral infection in cells with high cholesterol (apoE +
serum) was more than 3-fold higher compared to low
cholesterol. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.,
*P<0.05, **P<0.01, one-way ANOVA. (C) Depletion of
cellular cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin
(MβCD) blocked almost all viral entry measured by
pseudotyped luciferase assay. Data are expressed as
mean ± s.e.m., **P<0.01, two-sided Student’s t-test. (D)
Pseudotyped control virus, vesicular stomatitis G virus
(VSV-G), is not cholesterol dependent. Data are
expressed as mean ± s.e.m., n.s. P³0.05, one-way
ANOVA, n=6.

We found cholesterol loading (apoE + serum)
significantly increased SARS2-PV entry. Figure 1B
shows viral entry increased 50% compared to
control (serum only). Cholesterol unloading (apoEserum) had the opposite effect; viral entry
decreased almost 50% (Figure 1B). Methyl-betacyclodextrin (MbCD), a chemical known to extract
cholesterol from the membrane of cells, inhibited
more than 90% of SARS2-PV entry (Figure 1C). To
avoid any potential effect of cholesterol directly on
the virion, the cells were pretreated for all
cholesterol conditions (one hour), washed and
then exposed to the virion, i.e., the virion did not
experience any cholesterol treatment, only the
cells. To maintain consistency throughout the
paper we used endogenously expressed ACE2,
which is ~100 times less efficient than artificially
over expressing ACE2 Supplemental Figure S2C).
VSV-G is a distantly related virus that binds the
LDL receptor for entry. We found infection of cells
with a pseudotyped VSV-G had much less
sensitivity to cholesterol compared to SARS2-PV
with identical treatment; cholesterol depletion only
slightly decreased VSV-G entry (Figure 1D).
Likewise, cholesterol modulation with MbCD had
very little effect on VSV-G viral entry
(Supplemental Figure S2A).

Model for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry in high and low cholesterol. When cholesterol is high ACE2 translocated to
GM1 lipid rafts a position optimal for for viral binding and endocytosis. When cholesterol is low, ACE2 traffics
away from GM1 lipid rafts and position that poorly facilitates viral infection (PIP2 domains not shown).

To determine the amount of ACE2 positioned for
endocytic viral entry and its sensitivity to
cholesterol, we co-labeled ACE2 and GM1 lipid
rafts in HEK293T cells with ACE2 antibody labelled
with Cy3b and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated
fluorescent CTxB (a GM1 specific toxin), treated
cells with apoE/serum, and imaged with superresolution direct stochastical optical reconstruction
microscopy (dSTORM). dSTORM and other super
resolution techniques are capable of visualizing
nanoscale arrangements (i.e. sub-100 nm
diameter lipid domain structures) in intact cellular
membranes27–29.

Cholesterol dependent trafficking of the ACE2
receptor to endocytic entry point.
In biological membranes we have shown select raft
associated proteins easily move in and out of GM1
lipids with changing cellular cholesterol levels (e.g.
PLD2 and amyloid precursor protein), while other
proteins remain in GM1 lipid rafts (e.g. beta and
gamma secretase)14,15,26. Given the sensitivity of
SARS2-PV to cholesterol, we hypothesized that
the ACE2 receptor may likewise easily shift out of
the viral entry pathway in low cholesterol.

Figure 2A shows representative dSTORM images
of ACE2 and GM1 lipid rafts from apoE treated
cells with and without serum exposure (i.e., cells
loaded or not loaded with cholesterol,
respectively). The association of ACE2 with GM1
lipid rafts was measured by pairwise correlation.

two molecules are next to each other. For our
experiments we compared the pair correlation at
the closest radii (0-5 nm) as a percentage of control

function. (Figure S3E). The cells were fixed prior to
labeling to reduce potential artifacts in their
diameter size due to CTxB clustering33 (see
methods).
Cholesterol loading into lung tissue.
For cholesterol to have an effect in vivo, the
cholesterol must be loaded into the lungs where
the ACE2 expressing cells are located during an
infection. To confirm age-dependent loading of
cholesterol into lung tissue in vivo, we measured
cholesterol levels in young (8-week-old) and aged
(28-week-old) C57BL/6J wild type mice. Lungs
were fixed, removed, and 2.5 mg of lung tissue
assayed. We found cholesterol in the lung of older
adults was elevated (~45%) compared to young
mice (Figure 3A). The increase was significant with
a P value less than 0.01.

We found pairwise correlation of ACE2 with GM1
lipid rafts increased more than 3-fold in cholesterol
loaded cells (Figure 2B). We loaded cholesterol
using 4 µg/mL apoE and 10% serum, the same as
our viral entry assay. The increased correlation
was not due to a change in ACE2 concentration on
the cell surface (Supplemental Figure S3A-B). As
a positive control, and to confirm the effect
depends on cholesterol and not another
component of the serum or apoE regulation, we
treated the cells with MbCD. In agreement with our
viral entry assay, MbCD reduced ACE2 localization
with GM1 lipid rafts by ~70% (Supplemental Figure
S3C).

Next we investigated the loading of cholesterol into
lung tissue in aged (28 week) diabetic animals. We
increased cholesterol by diet induced obesity
(DIO), a well-established mouse model for type II
diabetes in of C57B/6J mice 34. We noted the
weight of the obese lung was increased compared
to healthy lung (Supplemental Figure S2B), most
likely due to increased fluid permeability in the
diabetic mouse. To control for potential excess
water in the diabetic mice, we normalized the
amount of cholesterol to total protein in the tissue
homogenate. Cholesterol normalized per µg of
protein was significantly elevated in DIO mice
compared to both 8 week and 28-week-old healthy
mice (40% and 22% respectively). This level of
cholesterol loading is consistent with cholesterol
loading into cultured cells and suggests an age and
obesity induced sensitivity to viral infection exists
in vivo.

We then co-labeled ACE2 with an antibody that
binds phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphate (PIP2)
lipids. PIP2 is a polyunsaturated signaling lipid that
forms domains in the disordered regions away from
GM1 lipid rafts 15,30–32 (See supplemental Figure
S1A). As expected, PIP2 pair correlation was
opposite of GM1, loading cells with cholesterol
decreased the association of PIP2 and ACE2
(Figure 2B). These data suggest that cholesterol
traffics ACE2 from the disordered regions with PIP2
to GM1 lipid rafts where it is positioned for
endocytic viral entry (Figure 2C).

To further confirm a cholesterol dependent effect,
we tested ACE2 localization to lipid rafts in whole
lung slices from obese mice. The percent pair
correlation for 28wo was more than an order of
magnitude higher in lungs from obese mice albeit
highly variable (N=10). Nonetheless the trend was
consistently higher than either young or control
untreated mice (Figure 3C). Labeling in lung was
sparser than in our tissue culture (Figure 3E),
which likely contributing to the variability. Figure 3F
shows an ACE2 based model for age and disease
related SARS2 infectivity. In aged obese mice,

We next investigated the effect cholesterol has on
the number of GM1 lipid rafts in the plasma
membrane (i.e., the number of viral entry points for
ACE2). Using cluster analysis, we found cells
loaded with cholesterol (+apoE) increased in both
the number and apparent diameter of GM1 labeled
rafts compared to serum only (not loaded control)
(Figure 2D-E). Cholesterol depletion by MbCD also
robustly decrease the apparent raft size (Figure
S3D). These decreases caused lipid rafts to

compartment).

of cholesterol in SARS-CoV-2 priming we loaded
producing cells (HEK293T) with cholesterol and
imaged furin trafficking in and out of lipid rafts.
Cholesterol (apoE + serum) increased furin’s pair
correlation with GM1 lipid rafts, a location that
likely favors hydrolysis of the spike protein at the
S1/S2 site and facilitates priming of the virus.

Little is known about palmitoylation of SARS-CoV2. We aligned SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and
found that all 9 putative palmitoylation sites in
SARS-CoV are conserved in SARS-CoV-2

(alanine to cysteine) introduces an additional
putative palmitoylation site in SARS-CoV-2, which

cholesterol is further increased by cytokines10. This
suggest a unique effect where cholesterol
concomitantly increases both inflammation and the
efficiency of viral entry. Almost all respiratory
viruses induce inflammation, but our mechanism
suggests SARS-CoV-2 is particularly sensitive due
to the increased entry in high cholesterol.

decreased with low cholesterol, we expect virion
from low cholesterol to also produce less
infectious virion. We expressed SARS2-PV in low
cholesterol cells pretreated with 4 µg/ml apoE.
Figure 4B shows depletion of cholesterol in
producer cells yields a much weaker virion. Viral
entry into normal control target cells decreased by
50%, suggesting low cholesterol likely decreases
priming of the virions.

Based on the finding of ACE2 sensitivity to
cholesterol and PIP2 and increased cholesterol
with age and disease, we propose a model for age
dependent infection of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3F).
When cholesterol is low there are very few entry
points (similar to children). With age, average
cellular cholesterol levels in the lung increases,
thereby increasing the number and size of viral
entry points (similar to adults). In chronically ill
patients, cellular cholesterol levels increase
dramatically and all the ACE2 receptor is
positioned for viral infectivity (adults + chronic
inflammation). The model is supported by age
dependent loading of cholesterol into lung tissue of
mice Figure 3A-B and the simultaneous
translocation of ACE2 from PIP2 domains to GM1
rafts (Figure 2C).

To confirm reduced cholesterol is similar to
inhibited furin in our assay, we produced SARS2PV in the presence of a furin specific inhibitor and
tested viral entry. Entry was reduced ~ 50% for
unprimed virus, consistent with previous results
and our hypothesis (Figure 4C). Adding the
inhibitor in the target cell, after the virus is already
primed, had no effect (Figure 4C and
Supplemental Figure S4C), suggesting furin does
not cut an unprimed virion in the target cell.
Figure 4D shows a proposed model for enhanced
viral entry in old compared to young due to
increased S1/S2 priming in virus producing cells.
In young individuals the furin is trafficked outside
of GM1 lipid rafts resulting in decreased access of
the spike protein to furin. In high cholesterol, furin
translocates into GM1 lipid rafts near virus. Low
cholesterol in the virion envelope may also
contribute to the low infectivity and or recycling of
furin into the Golgi (not shown).

We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 has at least three
cholesterol-dependent mechanisms that likely
contribute to differential infectivity in elderly with an
underlying
condition
and
with
chronic
inflammation. One, number of entry sites are
cholesterol dependent (Figure 2E). If there are
fewer endocytic points, the virus cannot enter the
cell as efficiently (Figure 1B-C). Two, the
cholesterol-dependent ability of the receptor, and
presumably the virus, to dock into the endocytic
lipids is logically one of the most important steps to
infectivity. If the virus isn’t positioned in the
membrane correctly it likely cannot enter the cell as
efficiently (Figure 1B). Third, furin priming that
activates SARS-CoV-2 for membrane insertion is
also sensitive to cholesterol and likely protects
against severe COVID19 symptoms in low
cholesterol (Figure 4D).

Cholesterol dependent SARS-CoV-2 receptor
binding
The effectiveness of viral entry in the disordered
region could also result from reduced binding to
the ACE2 in the disordered region. To test SARSCoV-2 binding, we applied the SARS-CoV-2
receptor binding domain (RBD) to HEK293T cells
with and without MbCD. MbCD treatment reduced
the binding of the RBD (Supplemental Figure
S4D), suggesting the virus may have evolved to
bind tighter to GM1 localized ACE2. However, the
effect was modest and suggests viral entry rather
than binding is likely more affected by cholesterol.

Our model suggests high cellular cholesterol is
indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, not
necessarily the levels of cholesterol in the blood.
Most clinical diagnosis of cholesterol are done by
analyzing blood samples, however these levels do
not necessary indicate the level of cholesterol in
the cellular membranes of tissue. This difference is

DISCUSSION
Taken together our findings show the level of
cellular cholesterol is a core contributor to SARSCoV-2 viral entry. During inflammation cellular

particularly true of chronic inflammation where
blood cholesterol is low due to inhibition of
cholesterol efflux proteins in the peripheral tissue10
(see also supplementary material). Our model is
consistent with a clinical study in China that
showed LDL and HDL cholesterol were low in
severe COVID19 patients, yet monocytes in the
blood had high cholesterol40. The high cholesterol
in monocytes is consistent with cholesterol loading
into tissue during chronic inflammation.

especially if taken over time to avoid early
infectivity.
METHODS
Cell culture
Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells
and HEK293T cells overexpressing human ACE2
(hACE2) were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
HEK293T cells overexpressing hACE2 were
generously provided by Dr. Michael Farzan
(Department of Immunology and Microbiology,
Scripps Research). Cells were generated by
transduction with murine leukemia virus (MLV)
pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G
protein and expressing myc-hACE2-c9, as
previously described56. Briefly, HEK293T cells
were co-transfected by PEI with three plasmids,
pMLV-gag-pol, pCAGGS-VSV-G and pQCXIPmyc-hACE2-c9 at a ratio of 3:2:1, and medium was
refreshed after overnight incubation of transfection
mix. The supernatant with produced virus was
harvested 72-hours post transfection and clarified
by passing through 0.45μm filter. 293T-hACE2
cells were selected and maintained with medium
containing puromycin (Sigma). hACE2 expression
was confirmed by SARS2-PV entry assays and by
immunofluorescence staining using mouse
monoclonal antibody recognizing c-Myc.

The role of palmitoylation aiding SARS-CoV-2
priming is based on the known affinity of palmitate
for GM1 ordered lipids37 and appropriately situated
spike protein for cutting in a GM1 lipid raft.
However, the high cholesterol could also cause
furin to be endocytosed and cycled back through
the Golgi where it would interact with the spike
protein as it traffics to the surface of the cell. More
research is needed to understand the role of
palmitoylation in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.
Previous studies used detergent resistant
membranes (DRMs) to characterize localization of
ACE2 and found ACE2 association with both
disordered41,42 and ordered lipids20. This is
consistent with our super resolution imaging in
intact membranes, suggesting the DRMs are a
good approximation of raft associated signal
transduction. Nonetheless, super resolution
imaging is an important validation of DRMs since
the detergent used to prepare the DRM’s may
biases proteins to the disordered region.

Production of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses

ACE2 association with PIP2 lipid domains is very
similar to our previous finding with phospholipase
D2. PIP2 opposes the function of GM1 lipid rafts by
opposing protein localization15,43. These results
suggest that cholesterol is likely in balance with
PIP2 in the membrane to regulate the trafficking of
an ACE2 in or out of the lipid raft and this may
change over with age and disease.

Retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins (SARS2-PV) was produced as previously

added in the same buffer as primary for 30 min at
room temperature followed by 5 washes as stated
above. Cells were then washed with PBS for 5 min.
Cell labelling and washing steps were
performed while shaking. Labeled cells were then
post-fixed with fixing solution, as above, for 10 min
without shaking followed by three 5 min washes
with PBS and two 3 min washes with deionized
distilled water.

Viral entry assay
HEK293T cells were cultured in 96-well flat culture
plates
with
transparent-bottom
(CorningTM
TM
Costar , #3585) pre-coated with poly-D-lysine.
Cells were incubated with media containing 4
μg/mL apoE with or without FBS supplementation
overnight before viral exposure. For MβCD
treatment, cells were incubated with 100 μM MβCD
for 30 min prior to virus infection. For furin inhibitor
treatment, cells were incubated with 25 μM hexaD-arginine amide for 1 hour prior to and during the
whole process of virus infection.
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were applied to the
cells and allowed to infect at 37 °C for 24 hours.
After viral infection, efficiency of viral entry was
determined through a firefly luciferase assay.
Specifically, cells were washed with PBS once and
16 μL Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega,
#E153A) were added into each well. The plate was
incubated for 15 min with rocking at room
temperature. 8 μL of cell lysate from each well was
added into a 384-well plate (CorningTM, #3574),
followed by the addition of 16 μL of Luciferase
Assay Substrate (Promega, #E151A). Luciferase
activity measurement was performed on a Spark
20M multimode microplate reader (Tecan). All the
infection experiments were performed in a
biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) laboratory.

Lung tissue preparation
Lungs were removed from C57BL/6J wild type and
diet induced obesity (DIO) mice. Housing, animal
care and experimental procedures were consistent
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Scripps Research
Institute. Mouse lung tissue slicing and staining
were performed as previously described77 with
minor modifications. Mouse tissues were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde / 1% glutaraldehyde at 4 °C
for 3 days. Tissues were sliced by the histology
core. Sections (50 μm) were collected and placed
into 24-well plate wells containing PBS. Fixative
chemicals were reduced by incubating with 0.1%
NaBH4 for 30 min while gently shaking at room
temperature followed by three times 10 min
washes with PBS. Samples were permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 hours and then
blocked with a standard blocking buffer (10%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) / 0.05% Triton in
PBS) for 6 hours at room temperature. For
labelling, samples were incubated with primary
antibody for 3 hours in 5% BSA / 0.05% Triton /
PBS at room temperature then 3 days at 4 °C
followed by 5 washes with 1% BSA / 0.05% Triton

brightness and size of fluorescent signals. Pair
correlation and cluster analysis was performed
using the Statistical Analysis package in
the Vutara SRX software. Pair Correlation analysis
is a statistical method used to determine the
strength of correlation between two objects by
counting the number of points of probe 2 within a
certain donut-radius of each point of probe 1. This
allows for localization to be determined without
overlapping pixels as done in traditional diffractionlimited microscopy. Raft size estimation and raft
density were calculated through cluster analysis by
measuring the length and density of the clusters
comprising of more than 10 particles with a
maximum particle distance of 0.1 µm. Ripley’s
H(r) analysis was performed to study the
distribution of lipid raft clusters.

dSTORM imaging
Images were recorded with a Zeiss ELYRA PS.1
microscope using TIRF mode equipped with a pilimmersion 63x objective. Andor iXon 897 EMCCD
camera was used along with the Zen 10D software
for image acquisition and processing. The TIRF
mode in the dSTORM imaging provided low
background high-resolution images of the
membrane. A total of 10,000 frames with an
exposure time of 18 ms were collected for each
acquisition. Excitation of the Alexa Fluor 647 dye
was achieved using 642 nm lasers and Cy3B was
achieved using 561 nm lasers. Cells and brain
tissues were imaged in a photo-switching buffer
comprising of 1% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma,
#63689), and oxygen scavengers (glucose oxidase
(Sigma, #G2133) and catalase (Sigma, #C40)) in
50mM Tris (Affymetrix, #22638100) + 10mM NaCl
(Sigma, #S7653) + 10% glucose (Sigma, #G8270)
at pH 8.0. Sample drift during acquisition was
corrected by an autocorrelative algorithm.
For PIP2 imaging, images were recorded with a
Bruker Vutara 352 with a 60X Olympus Silicone
objective. Frames with an exposure time of
20 ms were collected for each acquisition.
Excitation of the Alexa Fluor 647 dye was achieved
using 640 nm lasers and Cy3B was achieved using
561 nm lasers. Laser power was set to provide
isolated blinking of individual fluorophores. Cells
were imaged in a photo-switching buffer
comprising of 1% β-mercaptoethanol (SigmaAldrich, #63689), 50 mM cysteamine (SigmaAldrich #30070) and oxygen scavengers (glucose
oxidase (Sigma, #G2133) and catalase (Sigma,
#C40)) in 50mM Tris (Affymetrix, #22638100) +
10mM NaCl (Sigma, #S7653) + 10% glucose
(Sigma, #G8270) at pH 8.0. Axial sample drift was
corrected during acquisition through the Vutara
352’s vFocus system.
Images were constructed using the default
modules in the Zen software. Each detected event
was fitted to a 2D Gaussian distribution to
determine the center of each point spread function
plus the localization precision. The Zen software
also has many rendering options including
removing localization errors and outliers based on

Lung cholesterol assay
To measure the relative changes in cholesterol
level in lung tissue, we developed an Amplex Redbased cholesterol assay. Lungs were removed
from C57BL/6J wild type and diet induced obesity
(DIO) mice. Housing, animal care and
experimental procedures were consistent with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Scripps Research Institute.
The left lobe of each lung was homogenized with
RIPA lysis buffer. After centrifugation, supernatant
was collected for cholesterol and protein
measurement. 50 μL of supernatant were mixed
with 50 μL of assay solution containing 100 μM
Amplex red, 2 U/mL horseradish peroxidase, 4
U/mL cholesterol oxidase and 4 U/mL cholesteryl
esterase in PBS in 96-well plates with transparentbottom (CorningTM CostarTM, #3585). Relative
cholesterol concentration was determined for each
sample by measuring fluorescence activity with a
fluorescence microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200
PRO, reading from bottom) with excitation
wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength
of 585 nm. Subsequently, cholesterol level was
normalized by tissue weights and protein
concentration. Cholesterol signals were then
graphed (Mean ± s.e.m.) and statistically analyzed
(one-way ANOVA) with GraphPad Prism software
(v6.0f).

HEK293T cells were seeded into 96-well flat
culture plates with transparent-bottom (CorningTM
CostarTM, #3585) one day before experiment.
SARS-CoV-2 RBD with a human Fc fusion was a
generous gift from Dr. Michael Farzan (Department
of Immunology and Microbiology, Scripps
Research). HEK293T cells were incubated with 10
µg/mL RBD peptide in cell culture medium
overnight at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed
with PBS once before fixation with 3%
paraformaldehyde. After blocking with a standard
blocking buffer (10% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
/ 0.05% Triton in PBS) for 90 min at room
temperature, RBD binding to the cells were
labelled with Alexa 647 goat anti-human IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, # 109-606-098) for 6
hours at 4°C. After labelling, cells were washed
with PBS twice. Relative RBD binding was
determined in quintuplicate for each condition by
measuring fluorescent activity with a fluorescence
microplate reader (Tecan Infinite 200 PRO) with
excitation wavelength of 630 nm and an emission
wavelength of 680 nm.

significance was calculated using a two-tailed
unpaired parametric test with significance defined
as p < 0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001.
For the multiple comparison test, significance was
calculated using an ordinary one-way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test.

Supplemental Figures

Figure S1. Cholesterol transport and function in GM1 lipid rafts (A) The side view of a plasma membrane is
shown (top extracellular). The membrane partitions into regions of ordered (saturated) and disordered
(unsaturated) lipids. The ordered region contains cholesterol and sphingolipids (Sph). Packing of cholesterol
with saturated lipids is thought to provide order and makes ordered lipids thicker than disordered lipids. The
disordered region contains unsaturated lipids including phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidic acid (PA), and
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP2 and PA are signaling lipids and PIP2 forms its own lipid
domains separate from GM1 lipid rafts. Palmitoylation of proteins typically occurs on the cytosolic portion of the
membrane and inserts into the inner leaflet (red line with lipids attached). For a virus that exits the cell the
palmitoylation may insert into the extracellular leaflet. (B) Cartoon of cholesterol loading into lung pneumocyte’s
and macrophages. In healthy individuals most cholesterol is produced in the liver. Cholesterol effluxes through
ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters (not shown) and is loaded into apolipoproteins (e.g., A and E; apoA
and apoE). The cholesterol is then transported through the blood serum in the form of high- and low- density
lipoproteins to the lung. In the lung, receptors located on individual cell membranes (shown as one receptor for
simplicity) take up the cholesterol. In healthy individuals, excess cholesterol is effluxed with ABCA1 transporter
(green shading) from the plasma membrane of individual cells, loaded into apoA1 or apoE and transported back
to the liver for elimination. During chronic inflammation reverse cholesterol transport is inhibited and cholesterol
is loaded into macrophage rich tissues in the periphery.

expressing endogenous ACE2 (HEK293T WT) and HEK293T cells overexpressing hACE2 (ACE2 OE). Negative
(neg.) control are HEK293T cells treated identical to the other conditions except no virus was applied. The
endogenous expression was low but presumably much more physiologically relevant and shows ACE2 is
expressed in HEK293T sells albeit at comparatively low quantities. The result is a single side by side comparison,
but the values are in a typical range we see for these two systems. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.,
****P<0.0001, two-sided Student’s t-test.

Figure S3. dSTORM of ACE2 cluster (A) and signal (B) shows that the expression of ACE2 remains roughly
constant when cells are loaded or unloaded with cholesterol by the cholesterol transport protein apoE.
Although, while not statistically significant ACE2 expression appears to slightly decrease in high cholesterol
(ApoE + serum) which agrees with the clinical findings of decreased ACE2 surface expression in older people.
Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m.,*P<0.05, one-way ANOVA. (C) Cholesterol depletion with methyl-betacyclodextrin (MβCD) diminishes ACE2’s raft localization. (D) Cholesterol depletion by MbCD robustly decreases
the apparent size of GM1 lipid rafts after CTxB clusterin. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m., *P<0.05, twosided Student’s t-test. (E) Ripley’s H-Function (H(r)) showing raft separation after cholesterol depletion while
distance between rafts gets shorter as apoE transports cholesterol from serum into the membrane.

Figure S4. dSTORM of viral processing proteases. (A) Sequence alignment of the palmitoylation site in SARSCoV (GenBank: ABD72995.1) and SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: QII57161.1). Residues conserved are marked with
an asterisk. All 9 putative palmitoylation sites identified in SARS-CoV are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 (yellow
highlight). A single mutation introduces a 10th putative palmitoylation site (red shading). (B) Cholesterol
depletion by MβCD traffics furin out of the GM1 lipid rafts into disordered regions. Data are expressed as mean
± s.e.m., **P<0.01, two-sided Student’s t-test. (C) Unprimed virion was produced in HEK cells with furin inhibitor
and used to infect cells with and without furin inhibitor and with and without apoE. Furin inhibitor did not change
the infectivity of the unprimed virion with or with cholesterol loading (apoE). Hence, furin appears unable to
cut the virion in the target cell. Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m., **P<0.01, n.s. P³0.05, one-way ANOVA.
(D) The receptor binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was added to cells treated with or without methylbeta-cyclodextrin (MβCD). Binding was measured by fluorescence from an Alexa 647 labeled antibody to an Fc
tag on the RBD protein.
