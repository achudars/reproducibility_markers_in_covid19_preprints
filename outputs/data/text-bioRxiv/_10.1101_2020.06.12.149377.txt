ABSTRACT
The pandemic COVID-19 caused by the zoonotic virus SARS-CoV-2 has devastated countries
worldwide, infecting more than 4.5 million people and leading to more than 300,000 deaths.
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is an effective tool to monitor emerging strains and provide
information for intervention, thus help to inform outbreak control decisions. Here, we reported
the first effort to sequence and de novo assemble the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 using
PacBio’s SMRT sequencing technology in Vietnam. We also presented the annotation results
and a brief analysis of the variants found in our SARS-CoV-2 strain, which was isolated from a
Vietnamese patient. The sequencing was successfully completed and de novo assembled in less
than 30 hours, resulting in one contig with no gap and a length of 29,766 bp. All detected
variants as compared to the NCBI reference were highly accurate as confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. The results have shown the potential of long read sequencing to provide high quality
WGS data to support public health responses, and advance understanding of this and future
pandemics.

Key words: COVID-19, de novo sequencing, PacBio, SARS-CoV-2, SMRT sequencing, whole

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020), first emerged in Hubei
province, China, in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic by WHO in March
2020 (WHO, 2020). As of May 2020, more than 4.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been
recorded worldwide, resulting in more than 300,000 deaths (John Hopkins University, 2020;
Ministry of Health, 2020). COVID-19 is affecting 213 countries and territories around the world,
forcing unprecedented measures from every government including border closure, halting of
trade, lockdown of cities and social distancing. (WHO, 2020; Ministry of Health, 2020). In
Vietnam, there are currently 320 cases that are reported to be positive with SARS-CoV-2; and as
of 18th May, there are more than 70,000 people in involuntary isolation (Ministry of Health,
2020).
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus that carries an approximately 30 kilobases (kb) singlestranded positive-sense RNA genome, and belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus in the family
Coronaviridae (Coronaviridae Study Group of ICTV, 2020) in the same species as SARS-CoV
and SARS-related bat CoVs (Lu et al., 2020; Chan et al., 2020). Patterns of spread indicated that
SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted person-to-person, and may be more transmissible than SARSCoV (Li et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported to possess 14
open reading frames (ORF) encoding 27 proteins (Wu et al., 2020). The release of the nucleotide
sequences of SAR-CoV-2 just two weeks after the discovery of the first reported case
contributed to the rapid establishment of possible origins and in-depth studies of this virus (Lu et
al., 2020; Ceraolo et al., 2020). As of May 2020, more than 30,000 genome sequences of SARCoV-2 from many countries have been sequenced and uploaded to international, open access
databases including the GISAID Initiative (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017) and GenBank
(Benson et al., 2015).
Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a robust tool to provide a detailed picture of the sources of
infection and transmission chains, and thus help to inform outbreak control decisions (Gwinn et
al., 2019). Recently, genomic information has been regularly utilized to reconstruct several
outbreaks of zoonotic viral pathogens (Oude et al., 2020; Quick et al., 2016). Sharing and
combining genome sequence data during viral outbreaks is now recommended as an integral part
of outbreak response. However, among the genome sequences submitted to GISAID, many
assemblies are low quality. They can be fragmented or have multiple bases gaps that break ORF,
preventing correct analysis of identification and evolution of the virus (Ashby, 2020). These are
mainly caused by the short amplicon method’s limitation of the second-generation sequencing
(SGS) technologies, most notably Illumina which is being preferred by many laboratories
worldwide (Goodwin et al., 2016; Shendure et al., 2017, Ashby, 2020). Meanwhile, singlemolecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing developed by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) offers
significantly long read lengths with high accuracy, overcoming errors caused by problematic

genomic regions (Rhoads & Au, 2015). Most importantly, the highly-contiguous de novo
assemblies using PacBio sequencing can close gaps in current reference assemblies and
characterize structural variation in genomes (Rhoads & Au, 2015). The robustness of this method
has been increasingly applied for whole genome SAR-CoV-2 sequencing (Gonzalez-Reiche et
al., 2020; CDC, 2020).
As a contribution to the global efforts to track and trace the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, here
we report a method for whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 using PacBio’s SMRT
sequencing technology and the de novo assembly and annotation results. We also present a brief
analysis of the variants found in our SARS-CoV-2 strain, which was isolated from a Vietnamese
patient in Ho Chi Minh City.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 patient information
Samples from a patient denoted as A was enrolled in this study. The patient is a 20-year-old
woman returning to Vietnam on March 14th, 2020 from the United States (Pensylvania –
Philadelphia), transited in Taiwan and arrived in Ho Chi Minh City on flight number BR 395 two
days later. The patient was asymptomatic, and was quarantined at the airport. She did not have
any symptoms upon arrival but the oropharyngeal (OP) and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs were
still collected as required. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was detected by real-time reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City.
Virus cultivation
The Vero E6 cell lines were investigated for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and used for
virus isolation in this study. They were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
supplemented with heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (10%) and antibiotic and grown in a
humidified 370C incubator with 5% CO2. Confluent cells were maintained at 370C in 25 cm2
flask containing 5 mL maintenance medium supplemented with 16 mg/mL trypsin-TPCK, 100
U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. They were infected with filtered specimens. After
infection, all flasks were observed for cytopathic effects (CPE). Once the CPE was occurred, cell
culture supernatants were collected for virus detection and quantification by rRT-PCR, harvested
and divided into some aliquot tubes. If no CPE was observed after 72 hours, cell lines negative
for indicators of viral replication were blind-passages twice.
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
A 560 µL volume of lysis buffer containing guanidinium and carrier-RNA (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) was added to 200 µL supernatant from cell cultures. The sample was removed from
the BSL-3 to a BSL-2 laboratory, where it underwent nucleic acid extraction using the QIAamp
Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. A

50 µL volume of elute was used for removing contaminating DNA from RNA preparation by
Turbo DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A 8 µL volume of RNA, 1 µL of 50 ng/µL
random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and 1 µL of 10 µM de-oxy-nucleoside
triphosphates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were treated for 5 min at 65oC and added to 10
µL reverse transcription master mix containing 200 U/µL M-MLV RT enzyme (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). After incubation at 25oC for 10 min, 50oC for 50 min, then 85oC for 15
min, a 1 µL Rnase H was added and incubated at 37oC for 20 min. NEBNext Ultra II Nondirectional RNA Second strand synthesis module (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA)
enzyme mix was used for generating double strand DNA from first strand cDNA after incubation
at 16oC for 1 hour.
Library preparation
The dsDNA products were purified by Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA, USA). Before library preparation, input cDNA was quantified using the Qubit fluorometer
and Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) DNA assay reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). The input cDNA length was accessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). SMRTbell Libraries was prepared using Express Template
Prep Kit 2.0 with low DNA input (50 ng) (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) for
sequencing on the PacBio SEQUEL system according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly,
DNA damage was repaired using the SMRTbell Damage Repair Kit - SPv3 (Pacific Biosciences,
Menlo Park, CA, USA), the product was introduced for End-repair/A-tailing followed by ligation
to PacBio's adapter. The library was purified one time with 1.2 volumes of AMPure PB beads
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA). The size and amount of library was checked again using the
Bioanalyzer 2100 system and the Qubit fluorometer with Qubit High Sensitivity (HS) DNA
assay reagents, respectively. The library was then applied on a SMRT Cell (Pacific Biosciences,
Menlo Park, CA, USA). Total time for library preparation was 8 hours.
Whole-genome sequencing of a SARS-CoV-2 strain with PacBio SMRT
The library was bound to polymerase using Sequel I Binding Kit 3.0, (Pacific Biosciences,
Menlo Park, CA, USA) and purified by Ampure PB beads. DNA Control Complex 3.0 and
Internal Control Kit 3.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) were used to control the
sequencing procedure. The run design was created by Sample Setup software included in the
SMRTLink portal v5.1 with insert size of 1200 basepairs (bp), immobilization time of 2 hours,
pre-extension time of 2 hours and movie time of 10 hours.
De novo assembly
The sequencing signals were processed, evaluated and converted into raw read by the Primary
Analysis Computer server. All data was automatically transferred to the Secondary Analysis
Server system via the intranet. High quality sequence data was proofread and generated by

PacBio’s circular consensus sequencing (CCS), then de novo assembled using Canu software
v2.0 (Koren et al., 2017), and the quality of the assembly was checked by using Quast software
v5.0.2 (Gurevich et al., 2013).
Genome annotation and variant detection
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was annotated by VAPID v1.3 (Shean et al., 2019) using the
Ref_Seq Database on NCBI. Then, the sequenced was aligned with multiple sequences retrieved
from GISAID and the reference sequence MN908947v3 from NCBI (Wu et al., 2020) using
Clustal Omega v.1.2.4 by EMBL-EBI (Madeira et al., 2019). The variants were visualized by
using Geneious program v2020.1.2 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand) and listed out
manually.
In particular, the reference MN908947v3 is the first sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome,
originating from Wuhan, China. Other sequences were chosen in this analysis based on their
location, date of sampling and divided into three groups:
1. Sequences from the Europe group:
- Initial period: Italy, February 2020.
- Pandemic period: Germany, March 2020 and England, the UK, early April 2020.
2. Sequences from the North America group:
- Initial period: Washington State (WA), USA, beginning of March 2020.
- Pandemic period: New York (NY) and Pennsylvania (PA) State, USA, late of March
2020.
3. Sequences from the Asia-Oceania group:
- Initial period: Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia and Japan (Diamond Princess cruise ship),
January - February 2020.
- Pandemic period: Vietnam and Singapore, March 2020.
The Vietnamese sequences were collected from patients returing from China in January and
February (Thanh Hoa, Vinh Phuc) and patients who originated from Europe, or visited the region
during the spreading period in March (Hanoi, Quang Ninh).
Variant validation by Sanger sequencing
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing primers were designed in-house to
validate all detected variants (for more details on primer sequences used, please contact the
corresponding author). PCR components for a total reaction of 25 µL were: 12.5 µL of
DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix 2X (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 0.5 µL
of 10 pM forward and reverse primers, 100 ng of cDNA template and nuclease-free water up to
25 µL. The PCR cycling condition was set with optimized temperature for each primer set.
Finally, the PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequenced from

Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s guideline.

RESULTS
Isolation and cultivation of SARS-CoV-2 strain
The patient with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 was identified with cycle threshold (Ct) values of
28.06 (E gene) and 29.39 (RdRp gene). The original specimen was inoculated into cell culture.
The CPE was observed 2 days post inoculation and harvested cell supernatant one day later
(Figure 1). The Ct values of two different rRT-PCR were 15.58 for E gene and 16.68 for RdRp
gene, confirming isolation of SAR-CoV-2.
Preparation of cDNA template for whole-genome sequencing
After the evaluation of cDNA input length and quantity, we observed an average length of 1200
bp for the double stranded-cDNA, and a concentration of 1 ng/µL in total volume of 40 µL.
Library preparation for whole-genome sequencing
The library prepared with SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 and Sequel Binding Kit 3.0
kit had a concentration of 1.99 ng/µL with total volume of 20 µL. Final loading concentration on
the SMRT Cell was 8-pmol.
Whole-genome sequencing on PacBio SEQUEL
The maximum reading length using chemicals and SMRT Cell version 3.0 of PacBio was
approximately 140 kb; with library length of 1.2 kb, average reading length of 1.8 kb, and a N50
index of 2.1 kb. Distribution of read lengths and read quality is shown in Figure 2, showing high
number of high quality (HQ) reads between 500 bp to 4000 bp (Figure 2A). Parameters that may
affect the quality of the sequencing run such as adapter dimer (adapters merging instead of
forming a bell with the template) and short insert (template fragments smaller than the set insert
size of 1200 bp) are well within the optimal thresholds (data not shown).
De novo assembly and annotation of whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequence
The total time for data quality check and processing by the Analysis Server systems was 2 hours.
PacBio's CCS results showed that the reading quality was very high: the number of >Q20 reads
is greater than 192,000, resulting in more than 234 megabases (Mb) of data >Q20 with most
quality reads in Q60 (Figure 2B).

Several methods for de novo assembly of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequence were tested by
our group (data not shown), and Canu was the optimal software to assemble the SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence in one contig, with no gap and a length of 29,766 bp. (Table 1). VAPiD
annotation results showed a complete list of 14 reported ORFs. A list of annotated ORFs as well
as their locations on the sequenced viral genome in this study was shown in Table 2. The start
and stop locations are different from the reference sequence MN908947; however, the length and
the number of the ORFs are identical.
The sequence was subsequently submitted and curated on GISAID. It was given the accession ID
EPI_ISL_448222 and is now available to all GISAID participants.
Variant detection and validation
The sequence was aligned against 15 other sequences, together with MN908947v3 as the
reference sequence to evaluate its accuracy and to detect any possible variant. The multiple
alignment by Cluster Omega displayed 10 different single base variants compared to
MN908947v3 (Table 3). The locations of these variants on the SARS-CoV-2 genome are
presented in Figure 3, together with other aligned sequences.
Sanger sequencing has confirmed the accuracy of all variants detected in our sequence. The
results of the validation by Sanger sequencing are listed in the Supplementary Data.
DISCUSSION
The sequence in this study (sequence number 16 – Figure 3) displayed a pattern clearly shared by
a group of patients who originated from Europe, or visited the region during the spreading period
(sequence number 9 to 14 – Figure 3). This ‘European pattern’ includes the variants at position
241, 3037, 14408 and 23403. Among these, a notable mutation on the S protein (A23403>G,
translated to a mutation from aspartic acid (D) to glycine (G) at residue 614) has been reported to
be an important marker to distinguish between two viral clades in North America: the G strain is
predominantly on the East Coast, and the D strain is predominantly on the West Coast (Brufsky,
2020). This mutation has also been claimed to belong to an emerging SARS-CoV-2 strain which
originated from Europe (Korber et al., 2020). Patient A returned from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
on the East Coast of the US. This is the region reported to be predominated by the SARS-CoV-2
G strain spread from Europe through New York (Brufsky, 2020), and our analysis has
demonstrated the epidemiological evidences: the virus strain isolated from patient A and other
strains from the US East Coast (Pennsylvania (15) and New York (17) – Figure 3) share the
‘European pattern’, especially the A23403>G (D614G) mutation, in their genome sequences.
However, the additional variants (on ORF1ab, ORF3a and N protein) on our sequence compared
to the related sequences implied an accelerated divergence of SARS-CoV-2 strains during
March, when the virus was spreading aggressively globally.

In a situation where a new, unknown dangerous infectious disease can appear in the population
like COVID-19, the ability to swiftly and accurately sequence the novel pathogen’s genome is
critical to a country’s public health system, to provide information for research and intervention
(CDC, 2020; Wellcome Sanger Insitute, 2020). Here, we have shown our capacity and
preparedness for this purpose by successfully sequence and de novo assemble a SARS-CoV-2
whole genome in less than 30 hours, using PacBio’s SMRT sequencing technology. The genome
was of high quality (Figure 2), without any gap (Table 1) and all variants called were highly
accurate as confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Data). Thus, it can fulfill many
potential uses including taxonomic identification, comparative genomics, molecular test degisn
for detection and development of immunological assays (Ladner et al., 2014)
Notably, compared to the NCBI reference MN908947v3 with a length of 29,903 bp, this
sequence is shorter by 137 bp. In particular, the 5’ terminus is 19 bp shorter, while the 3’
terminus is 118 bp shorter. However, it is important to note that the reference sequence
MN908947 was sequenced using Illumina technology with a pair-end library reads of only 150
bp, resulting in a contig of 30,474 bp length from a total of 384,096 contigs assembled. Thus, it
requires extra steps of RT–PCR and 5 /3 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to
determine and confirm both the accuracy and the real length of the sequence (Wu et al., 2020).
Despite sharing the same problem of missing ends often encountered with de novo assembly
(Marston et al., 2013), the sequence generated by PacBio was assembled into only one contig
with significantly higher coverage (1,700x compared to 600x), reducing the need to reconfirm
the sequence’s accuracy.

Furthermore, the total data collected reached 11.93 gigabases (Gb) from only 8 pmol cDNA
input, while the loading capacity was under the optimal threshold (data not shown), showing
further potential of this system to handle dozens of SARS-CoV-2 samples on a single SMRT
cell. This is crucial to any further project to mass sequence all virus strains circulating in the
communities. As shown in the analysis above, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of acquiring novel
mutations rapidly as it spreads in various human populations. Hence, consistent, real-time WGS
data is needed to track transmission of virus, enabling the investigation of clusters and mapping
how COVID-19 spreads and behaves (CDC, 2020; Wellcome Sanger Insitute, 2020). Our ability
to quickly sequence highly accurate genomes combined with the potential of multiplexing
dozens of samples in one run will be an asset in the efforts against not only this COVID-19
pandemic, but all future infectious disease responses.
