Abstract

38

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-strand RNA

39

virus. Viral genome is capped at the 5’-end, followed by an untranslated region (UTR). There

40

is poly-A tail at 3’-end, preceded by an UTR. Self-interaction between the RNA regulatory

41

elements present within 5’- and 3’-UTRs as well as their interaction with host/virus-encoded

42

proteins mediate the function of 5’- and 3’-UTRs. Using RNA-protein interaction detection

43

(RaPID) assay coupled to liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometry, we

44

identified host interaction partners of SARS-CoV-2 5’- and 3’-UTRs and generated an RNA-

45

protein interaction network. By combining these data with the previously known protein-

46

protein interaction data proposed to be involved in virus replication, we generated the RNA-

47

protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network, likely to be essential for controlling SARS-CoV-2

48

replication. Notably, bioinformatics analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of

49

factors involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism. Lysosome-associated

50

membrane protein-2a (Lamp2a) was one of the host proteins that interact with the 5’-UTR.

51

Further studies showed that Lamp2 level is upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and

52

overexpression of Lamp2a and Lamp2b variants reduced viral RNA level in infected cells

53

and vice versa. In summary, our study provides an useful resource of SARS-CoV-2 5’- and

54

3’-UTR binding proteins and reveal the antiviral function of host Lamp2 protein.

Importance

75

Replication of a positive-strand RNA virus involves an RNA-protein complex consisting of

76

viral genomic RNA, host RNA(s), virus-encoded proteins and host proteins. Dissecting out

77

individual components of the replication complex will help decode the mechanism of viral

78

replication. 5’- and 3’-UTRs in positive-strand RNA viruses play essential regulatory roles in

79

virus replication. Here, we identified the host proteins that associate with the UTRs of SARS-

80

CoV-2, combined those data with the previously known protein-protein interaction data

81

(expected to be involved in virus replication) and generated the RNA-protein-protein

82

interaction (RPPI) network. Analysis of the RPPI network revealed the enrichment of factors

83

involved in translation initiation and RNA metabolism, which are important for virus

84

replication. Analysis of one of the interaction partners of the 5’-UTR (Lamp2a) demonstrated

85

its antiviral role in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Collectively, our study provides a resource of

86

SARS-CoV-2 UTR-binding proteins and identifies an antiviral role of host Lamp2a protein.

Introduction

112

In December 2019, a highly pathogenic coronavirus was identified in the Wuhan city, China,

113

which was named as 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 (1,2,3). Since then, the virus has spread

114

globally and World health organization (WHO) has classified the outbreak as a pandemic.

115

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae. Coronaviruses are known to be present

116

in animals and humans for a long time, usually resulting in respiratory and intestinal

117

dysfunction in the host (4). Until the emergence of Severe acute respiratory syndrome

118

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, coronaviruses were not considered to be a significant

119

threat to human health (5). However, within last 18 years since the SARS outbreak, three

120

major human coronavirus outbreaks have occurred, suggesting that highly pathogenic

121

human coronaviruses are evolving fast. Considering the severity of the current SARS-CoV-2

122

pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand the life cycle and pathogenetic mechanism

123

of the virus. Since all coronavirus genomes share significant homology, the knowledge

124

obtained from the study of SARS-CoV-2 genome will be useful to formulate a long-term

125

action plan to deal with the current as well as future coronavirus outbreaks.

126

Coronaviruses are positive strand RNA viruses. Viral genome serves as the template for

127

synthesis of antisense strand, production of proteins involved in replication as well as

128

assembly of the progeny virions (6). Viral genome is capped at the 5’-end and poly

129

adenylated at the 3’-end. 5’ and 3’-ends of the genome contain noncoding sequences, also

130

known as untranslated regions (UTRs). 5’- and 3’-UTRs in the positive strand of RNA

131

viruses play essential regulatory roles in virus replication, enhancing the stability of the viral

132

genomic RNA, host immune modulation and encapsidation of the viral genome into the

133

nucleocapsid core. Additionally, cis-acting regulatory elements are present within the coding

134

regions of the positive and negative strand (replication intermediate) of the viral genome.

135

These regulatory RNA elements also play significant roles in the life cycle and pathogenesis

136

of the virus. Intraviral interactions between regulatory RNA elements of the virus and

137

intraviral as well as virus-host RNA-protein interactions control the function of the 5’-, 3’-

138

UTRs and internal cis-acting RNA elements of the virus (7, 8).

139

SARS-CoV-2 contains a 260-nucleotide long 5’-UTR and a 200 nucleotide long 3’-UTR.

140

These UTRs show considerable homology with the 5’- and 3’-UTRs of other beta

141

coronaviruses such as SARS and SARS related beta coronaviruses (9). Distinct stem loops

142

and secondary structures within the UTRs are known to mediate their regulatory function.

143

Notably, stem loop I and stem loop II (SL-I and SL-II) of the 5’-UTR are important for long

144

range interaction and subgenomic RNA synthesis, respectively. SL-III contains the

145

translation-regulatory sequence (TRS), which is essential for the discontinuous transcription

146

of ORF1ab. SL-5 is crucial for the viral RNA packaging and translation of the ORF1ab

147

polyprotein (10, 11, 12).

148

The 3’-UTR of coronaviruses is important for viral replication (RNA synthesis and

149

translation). It contains a hyper variable region (HVR) which, has been shown to be

150

important for pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). HVR contains a stem loop II-like

151

motif (S2M) that associates with host translation factors (13). S2M motif is also present in

152

the 3’-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (9).

153

Interaction of host proteins with the 5’- and 3’-UTRs of viral genomic RNA is important for

154

replication and pathogenesis of many RNA viruses. Interaction of polypyrimidine tract

155

binding protein (PTB) with the 5’-UTR-TRS of MHV is known to control transcription of the

156

viral RNA (14, 15, 16). Further, RNA helicases such as DDX1, DHX15; proteins involved in

157

translation regulation such as eIF1a, eIF3S10; proteins involved in cytoskeleton movement

158

such as tubulin, Annexin A2, moesin as well as GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

159

dehydrogenase) is known to associate with the 5’-UTR of few coronaviruses (7, 17). 3’-UTR

160

of MHV associates with hnRNPA1 and modulate viral replication (18). Poly-A binding protein

161

(PABP), transcriptional activator p100 (SND1), heat shock proteins (HSP40, HSP 60, HSP

162

70) associate with the 3’-UTR of MHV (19). Functional significance of some these

163

interactions are known (8).

164

Despite general acceptance of the importance of the 5’- and 3’-UTRs of RNA viruses in

165

controlling their replication and pathogenesis, no systematic study has been under taken to

166

elucidate the molecular composition of the RNA-protein complex assembled at the 5’- and

167

3’-UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 and function of 5’- and 3’-UTRs of SARS CoV-2.

168

We employed RNA-protein interaction detection (RaPID) assay coupled to liquid

169

chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) to identify the repertoire of

170

host proteins that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 5’- and 3’-UTR (20). These datasets were

171

used to construct the virus-host RNA-Protein-protein interaction (RPPI) network. In silico

172

analyses of the RPPI network revealed enrichment of proteins involved in multiple processes

173

such as Cap-dependent translation and RNA metabolism. Further studies revealed an

174

antiviral role of LAMP2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional significance of these

175

findings in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis is discussed.

182

and 3’-UTRs, respectively (nucleotides 1-264 and 29676-29878 in the viral genome), were

183

cloned into the pRMB vector in between the BirA Ligase binding stem loop (SL-A and SL-B)

184

sequences (Fig 1A-C). 5’- and 3’-UTRs consist of 264 and 228 nucleotides, respectively.

185

Extra bases were included at the 5’-end to ensure that stem loops in the predicted

186

secondary structures of the 5’-UTR remain intact in the hybrid RNA (Fig 1A). Eight Adenine

187

residues were retained at the 3’-end (Fig 1B). “mfold” mediated comparison of the secondary

188

structures of the 5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA sequences with and without BirA ligase binding

189

stem loop RNA sequences indicated that secondary structures of viral 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR

190

and BirA binding stem loops (SL-A and SL-B) are not disturbed in the hybrid RNA sequence

191

(compare SL-I to SL-Vc in the 5’-300 RNA and SL-A and SL-B in Fig 1A and S1 Fig;

192

compare SL-I to SL-IV and SL-A and SL-B in Figure 1B and S2 Fig). RaPID (RNA-Protein

193

interaction detection) assay was performed to identify the host proteins that interact with the

194

5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA in HEK293T cells. RaPID assay allows BirA ligase mediated in vivo

195

biotin labeling of host proteins that interact with the RNA sequence of interest cloned in

196

between the BirA ligase-binding RNA motifs. Biotinylated proteins are captured using

197

streptavidin agarose beads and identified by LC-MS-MS (Fig 1C, 20). Thus, both transiently

198

interacting and stably interacting proteins can be identified using this technique.

199

Expression of BirA ligase in HEK293T cells was confirmed by western blot using anti-HA

200

antibody that recognizes the HA-tag fused to the BirA ligase (Fig 1D). Optimal duration of

201

biotin treatment was selected through a time course analysis of biotin labeling, based on

202

which 18 hour labeling period was selected (Fig 1E). To test the functionality of the RaPID

203

assay, interaction between CUGBP1 protein and EDEN15 RNA was tested in the HEK293T

204

cells (20). Streptavidin pulldown of EDEN15 RNA interacting proteins, followed by western

205

blot using CUGBP1 antibody revealed the interaction between them, in agreement with

206

earlier report (Fig 1F, 20).

207

HEK293T cells expressing the SL-A-5’-300-SL-B or SL-A-3’-203-SL-B or SL-A-SL-B (pRMB)

208

was treated with Biotin, followed by pulldown of biotinylated proteins and LC-MS-MS

209

analysis. Biotin untreated cells were processed in parallel as control. Samples from three

210

independent experiments were run in triplicate. Pearson correlation analysis of MS data

211

demonstrated good correlation between replicates for individual biological samples (average

212

range: 0.5-0.98, Fig 2A). Specific and strong interaction partners of 5’-300 and 3’-203 RNAs

213

were identified in three steps (a) only those proteins having at least one biotinylated peptide

214

and a “Pep score” of 15 or more in all LC-MS samples were selected [(S3 Fig, S1 Table)

215

(21]; (b) subtraction of pRMB dataset from 5’-300 and 3’-203 datasets (Fig 2B); (c) from the

216

background subtracted dataset, only those proteins with minimum 2 unique peptides and

217

“Prot score” of 40 or more were considered for further analysis (Table 1).

218

Following similar protocol, in an unrelated study, we had identified host interaction partners

219

of the 3’-end (3’-UTR + adjacent 100 nucleotides) of the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genomic

220

RNA (S2 Table). HEV is a positive strand RNA virus of the hepeviridae family and 3’-end of

221

the HEV harbors a secondary structure composed of multiple stem loops that have been

222

predicted to be important for viral replication (22). In order to further increase our confidence

223

in reliability of the RaPID technique, HEV 3’-end RNA interacting protein list was compared

224

to the SARS-CoV-2 5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA-interacting protein list. One protein (Histone

225

H3.1) was found to be common between the two datasets, indicating specificity of the

226

interacting proteins for the RNA baits. Therefore, using RaPID assay, 47 and 14 host

227

proteins were identified to interact with the 5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA, respectively (Table 1).

228

Out of these, 4 proteins (UBA1, GNL2, JAKMIP3 and YTHDF3) interacted with both 5’- and

229

3’-UTRs (Table 1, represented in bold font). A recent publication reported the atlas of

230

proteins bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the RAP-MS (RNA Antisense Purification

231

with Mass Spectrometry) technique (23). Comparison with that data identified 10 proteins to

232

be present in our 5’-300 dataset and 1 protein in the 3’-203 RNA binding protein data set

233

(Table 1). Based on human protein atlas data, except HIST3H3 and SLC25A31, rest 55

234

proteins are expressed in both human lungs and intestine (S3 Table).

Construction and analysis of the RNA-Protein-Protein interaction network at the 5’-

259

and 3’-ends of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

260

5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA binding protein datasets were imported to “Cytoscape” to construct

261

the RNA-Protein-protein interaction networks (RPPI network) (24). 3’-203 interacting

262

proteins did not show any significant network characteristics (observed number of edges =1,

263

expected no. of edges =1, numbers of node =14 Average node degree = 0.143, average

264

clustering coefficient = 0.143 and PPI enrichment P value = 0.437) (Fig 2C). However, 5’-

265

300 and 5’-300+3’-203 interaction RPPI networks showed significant enrichment of

266

272

300+3’203 RPPI network is stronger than the 5’-300 network (Fig 2D, 2E).

273

Recently protein interaction map of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported (25). Since RNA-protein

274

complex assembled at the 5’- and 3’-UTR as well as Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

275

(RdRp)-associated protein complex are known to drive the viral replication process in

276

positive strand RNA viruses, we combined the 5’-300+3’-203 RPPI dataset and previously

277

reported PPI dataset (only the subset of PPI proposed by Gordon and coworkers to be

278

involved in viral replication) to generate an integrated RPPI network of SARS-CoV-2

279

replication machinery (S4 Fig). As expected, the integrated RPPI network showed

280

significantly higher PPI enrichment compared to replication PPI alone [(Integrated RPPI

281

282

285

286

and S4B Figs).

287

Next, gene ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway analysis of the RPPI network was

288

performed using “GSEA tool” to determine the significantly enriched processes/pathways

289

(S5 and S6 Figs) (26, 27). Of note, proteins involved in intracellular transport, translation

290

initiation, amide biosynthetic pathway and mRNA metabolism were enriched in the GO-

291

Biological processes category (Table 2A). Similarly, proteins involved in cellular response to

292

external stimuli, HSP 90 chaperones for steroid hormone receptors, RNA metabolism,

293

translation, Influenza infection, infectious disease, cell cycle etc. were enriched in Reactome

294

pathway analysis (Table 2A).

295

Since, 5’- and 3’-UTRs are well conserved, drugs directly targeting the UTRs or acting upon

296

the proteins that interact with the UTRs may function as potent antivirals by inhibiting the

297

viral replication process. A search for known drugs against the 57 RNA binding proteins

298

listed in Table 1 identified six proteins (RPL13, PDHA1, HABP4, MTHFD1, TUBA1A,

299

PLA2G4A), against whom known drugs exist (Table 2B). Notably, Thalidomide, which

300

targets RPL13, is being tested in clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy as an anti-inflammatory

301

therapeutic in COVID-19 patients (28). C-1-tetrahydrofolate synthase (MTHFD1) is the target

302

of Tetrahydrofolic acid or vitamin B9, which is being used as a supplement in CoVID-19

303

treatment (29). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A) is the target of steroid drug Fluticasone

304

propionate. A recent report shows the ability of another steroid drug “Ciclesonide” to block

305

SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting its replication-transcription complex (30).

331

Lamp2 is a host restriction factor against SARS CoV-2

332

Lamp2a (CD107b) was identified as an interaction partner of the 5’-300 RNA in RaPID

333

assay. LAMp2a is the receptor for chaperone mediated autophagy and recent studies have

334

proposed a role of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (31). Hence, significance of the

335

interaction between 5’-300 RNA and Lamp2a in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle was investigated

336

using mammalian cell culture-based infection model of SARS CoV-2.

337

Vero E6 cell based infection model of SARS-CoV-2 was established to investigate the role of

338

Lamp2a in SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Productive infection of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2

339

was detected by immunofluorescence staining of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein at 48

340

hour post-infection using anti-N antibody (Fig 3A). N- staining was not observed in

341

uninfected cells (Fig 3A). Expression of N protein was also detected by western blot using

342

anti-N antibody, 48-hour post infection (Fig 3B, upper panel). An aliquot of the samples were

343

immunoblotted with anti-GAPDH antibody to monitor equal loading of protein in uninfected

344

and infected cells (Fig 3B, lower panel). Next, level of viral RNA in the culture media (from

345

released virus) and inside the cells (intracellular) was measured by the quantitative real time

346

PCR (QRT-PCR) analysis of 48 hour and 72 hour SARS-CoV-2 infected samples using

347

SYBR green based method. QRT-PCR detection of RNA polymerase II (RP II) and RNase P

348

(RP) served as normalization control for intracellular and secreted RNA quantity,

349

respectively. An increase in viral RNA level was observed in 72 hour infected intracellular

350

and secreted samples, compared to 48 hour infected sample, indicating productive infection

351

of Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3C). Aliquots of the RNA from culture media was

352

also used in Taqman probe based one step QRT-PCR analysis using primers and probes

353

recommended by the Centre for disease control (CDC), USA, for detection of SARS-CoV-2

354

(Fig 3D). Both SYBR green and Taqman QRT-PCR methods showed comparable result,

355

hence SYBR green method was followed in subsequent experiments. Collectively, these

356

data demonstrate the establishment of Vero E6 infection model of SARS-CoV-2 in our

357

experimental setups.

358

A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was conducted to monitor the interaction between

359

5’-300 region of viral genome and Lamp2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells. Lamp2

360

(green) and 5’-300 RNA specific probe (red) colocalized (indicated by yellow), suggesting

361

their interaction (Fig 3E). Next, smart pool SiRNA targeting Lamp2 RNA was used to deplete

362

Lamp2 protein in veroE6 cells. Western blot of Vero E6 whole cell extract after 48 and 72

363

hours of Lamp2 siRNA transfection demonstrated that siRNA was effective in reducing total

364

Lamp2 level by >90% in siRNA transfected cells (Fig 3F, upper panel). GAPDH was used as

365

a loading control (Fig 3F, lower panel). QRT-PCR of 72 hour siRNA transfected SARS-CoV-

366

2 infected Vero E6 cells (analyzed 48 hour post-infection) revealed an increase in viral RNA

367

level in both culture medium (Fig 3G) and inside the cells (Fig 3H).

368

Results obtained in Vero E6 cells were further verified in a human hepatoma (huh7) cells-

369

based infection model of SARS CoV-2. Recent reports have shown the utility of Huh7 cells

370

as a viable model for SARS-CoV-2 infection (23, 32). Infection of Huh7 cells by SARS-CoV-

371

2 was confirmed by measuring the level of viral RNA inside the cells (intracellular) as well as

372

in the culture medium (secreted). As expected, an increase in viral RNA level at 72 hour

373

post-infection period (compared to 48 hour post-infection) indicated productive infection of

374

these cells (S7A Fig). Further, western blot using anti-N antibody confirmed N-expression in

375

infected samples (72 hour, S7B Fig). Lamp2 siRNA transfection reduced the corresponding

376

protein level by >90% in Huh7 cells (S7C Fig). A significant increase in viral RNA level was

377

observed in both culture medium and intracellular samples in 72 hour Lamp2 siRNA

378

transfected and 48 hour SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells (S7D and 7E Figs).

379

Lamp2 is present in three different forms in mammalian cells that include Lamp2a, Lamp2b

380

and Lamp2c, produced through alternative splicing (33). Lamp2a and Lamp2b are the major

381

forms. Lamp2a is highly expressed in lungs, liver and placenta. Lamp2b varies from Lamp2a

382

in the last 11 amino acids at its C-terminal sequence and it is highly expressed in Skeletal

383

muscle (34). Lamp2 antibody used in this study recognizes all three Lamp2 variants.

384

Next, the effect of overexpression of each Lamp2 isoform on SARS-CoV-2 replication was

385

tested in Vero E6 cells. Overexpression of Lamp2a and Lamp2b significantly reduced the

386

viral RNA level whereas Lamp2c overexpression did not alter viral RNA level at 48 hour

387

post-infection, both in culture medium (Fig 4A) and intracellular samples (Fig 4B). Lamp2a, b

388

and c overexpression was confirmed in aliquots of the sample using anti-lamp2 antibody,

389

which recognizes all Lamp2 variants (Figs 4C-4E) as well as using anti-HA antibody (for

390

Lamp2a). Similar results were obtained in Huh7 cell-based model of SARS-CoV-2 infection

391

(S7F-7J Figs). Note that overexpressed Lamp2a and Lamp2b could be detected using both

392

anti-HA and anti-Lamp2 antibodies in Huh7 cells but overexpressed Lamp2b could be

393

detected using only anti-Lamp2 antibody in Vero E6 cells. Also note that no epitope tag is

394

present in Lamp2c expression clone. Hence it was detected using anti-Lamp2 antibody.

395

In order to test if the observed reduction in viral RNA levels were specific to Lamp2, effect of

396

Lamp1 depletion on SARS-CoV-2 replication was evaluated. Western blot using anti-Lamp1

397

antibody showed ~90% reduction in Lamp1 protein level in siRNA transfected Huh7 cells at

398

48 hour and 72 hour time points (Fig 4F). QRT-PCR analysis of Lamp1 SiRNA treated

399

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells did not show any significant change in the level of viral RNA in

400

culture medium (Fig 4G) and intracellular samples (Fig 4H).

401
402

Increased Lamp2 protein level in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells does not promote

403

autophagolysosome formation

404

Lamp2a is the receptor for chaperone mediated autophagy and silencing of Lamp2

405

expression promoted SARS-CoV-2 replication. Therefore, we next measured the status of

406

autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. An increase in the level of LAMP2, LC3 II and p62

407

protein was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 and Huh7 cells (Fig 5A). No

408

change in the level of Lamp1 was observed (Fig 5A). Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected

409

Vero E6 and Huh7 cells with 3 methyl adenine (3-MA), which is a specific inhibitor of

410

autophagy, completely diminished viral RNA in both culture medium and intracellular

411

samples (Fig 5B-E). Next, Immunofluorescence staining of Lamp2 (green) and LC3 (Red)

412

proteins was performed in SARS-CoV-2 infected or uninfected Vero E6 cells. Formation of

413

autophagolysosome is indicated by colocalization of Lamp2 and LC3, which forms “yellow”

414

color puncta in dual stained cells (35). No increase in autophagolysosome formation was

415

visible in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells (Fig 5F).

416
417

Discussion

418

In this study, we identified 57 host proteins that interact with the 5’- and 3’-ends of the

419

SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, combined those dataset with the PPI dataset proposed to be

420

involved in viral replication and constructed an RPPI network, which is likely to be

421

assembled during the replication of SARS-CoV-2. Interaction of 5’- and 3’- regulatory

422

elements with virus-encoded and host proteins mediate their function. Since 5’- and 3’-

423

regulatory elements are known to play indispensable roles in replication process of RNA

424

viruses, identification of the components of the above-mentioned RNA-protein complex

425

paves the way for designing novel antiviral therapeutic strategies against the SARS-CoV-2.

426

Among the viral proteins, N protein of MHV, TGEV and SARS-CoV binds to the 5’-UTR (8).

427

NSP8 and Nsp9 of MHV binds to the 3’-UTR (36). Many host proteins are known to bind to

428

the 5’- and 3’- UTR of viral genome and regulate virus replication (7). During the course of

429

this study, Schmidt et al. identified a number of host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNA

430

in infected Huh7 cells using the RAP-MS technique (23). Comparison of their dataset to that

431

of this study identified 11 common proteins. This study identified additional 46 host proteins

432

that associate with 5’- and 3’-UTRs of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This may be attributed to the

433

ability of RaPID technique to detect both stable and transient as well as direct and indirect

434

(as a protein complex) RNA-protein interactions. Specificity of the data is evident from the

435

fact that only one protein (HIST1H3) is common between SARS-CoV-2 and HEV RPPI

436

datasets. Note that similar to SARS CoV-2, HEV is also a positive strand RNA Virus, which

437

contains a capped 5’-end, followed by a 5’-UTR and poly A tail preceded by a 3’-UTR (37).

438

Therefore, some aspects of replication process might be similar in both viruses.

439

In addition to lungs, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to cause enteric infection. High level of

440

ACE2 is expressed in the intestinal epithelial cells and COVID-19 patients suffer from

14

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.425516; this version posted January 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

441

gastrointestinal disorders (4). Therefore, we hypothesized that host proteins that are crucial

442

for the survival of the virus should be expressed in both lung and intestinal epithelium cells.

443

Comparison of expression of 5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA binding proteins in lung and intestinal

444

epithelium cells showed that 55 out of 57 proteins are expressed in both tissues, in support

445

of the above statement.

446

Among the 5’- and 3’-UTR interacting host proteins, known drugs exist against RPL13,

447

PDHA1, HABP4, MTHFD1, TUBA1A and PLA2G4A. Interestingly, some of the drugs being

448

used/tested in COVID-19 patients such as Thalidomide and Ciclosonide act by targeting two

449

of the above-mentioned proteins. Nevertheless, further studies are required to conclude if

450

those drugs act in COVID-19 patients by targeting the observed RNA-protein interaction or

451

through any other mechanism.

452

Gene ontology and Reactome pathway analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 5’- and 3’-UTR RPPI

453

datasets show an enrichment of proteins involved in different processes such as translation

454

initiation, RNA metabolism, infectious disease, which is expected. Therefore, the data

455

obtained by the RaPID assay is an useful resource for future studies related to the SARS

456

CoV-2. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR interacting proteins obtained in the

457

RaPID assay with those shown in other positive strand RNA viruses reveal a similar profile

458

of many functional protein categories. Proteins belonging to the ribosome complex such as

459

RPL7a, RPLP2, RPL13, RPL4 and translation initiation factor such as eIF5B were found to

460

interact with the SARS-CoV-2 5’-and 3’-UTR. Being a capped RNA, SARS-CoV-2 genomic

461

RNA is supposed to utilize the canonical cap-dependent translation process for producing

462

viral proteins and above-identified host factors might be used by the virus for efficiently

463

translating its own RNA. Heat shock proteins of the HSP70 and HSP90 family are required

464

for maintenance of cellular homeostasis by virtue of their ability to recognize and fold or

465

remove unfolded proteins (38). They are also important for proper assembly and/or

466

disassembly of viral replication complex (39). They require the adapter protein STIP1 for

467

optimal activity. In the case of SARS CoV-2, HSP71, HSP71L and STIP1 were found to

468

interact with the 5’-UTR. Dead box RNA helicases such as DDX1 and DHX15 are known to

469

associate with the TRS in MHV (7). DDX24 was identified to interact with the 3’-UTR of

470

SARS CoV-2. DDX24 is known to associate with RNA and negatively regulate RIG-I-like

471

receptor signaling, resulting in inhibition of host antiviral response (40). Several proteins

472

encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 such as Nucleocapsid, ORF6 and ORF8 are known to inhibit

473

host antiviral response (41). Interaction of DDX24 with SARS-CoV-2 3’-UTR might be an

474

additional strategy to inhibit the host antiviral response. Further studies are required to

475

confirm the above hypothesis.

476

ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1 (ABCE1) is another important host protein that

477

interacts with the 5’-UTR. ABCE1 (RNAse L inhibitor) inhibits the activity of RNAse L, which

15

478

is activated by the host antiviral response mechanism in response to RNA virus infection or

479

IFN a/b stimulation (42). Active RNAse L cleaves the viral RNA, which is prevented in the

480

presence of ABCE1. It will be interesting to explore the significance of 5’-UTR interaction

481

with ABCE1. Note that ABCE1 was also identified as a direct interaction partner of SARS-

482

CoV-2 RNA by Schmidt et al. (23). FKBP4 was also found to interact with the 5’-UTR. It is a

483

member of the immunophilin protein family and binds to immunosuppressants FK506 and

484

rapamycin (43). Further, Ras GTPase activating protein binding protein 2 (G3BP2), which is

485

key to stress granules formation, was found to interact with the 5’-UTR of SARS CoV-2.

486

G3BP1/2 has also been shown to bind to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 (25). Stress granules

487

play key roles controlling viral infections (44). N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is predicted to

488

associate with the 5’-UTR. Hence, interaction of both N and 5’-UTR with G3BP2 may be an

489

important strategy of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate the function of stress granules in infected

490

cells. 5’-UTR was also found to interact with the exosome endoribonuclease RRP4, which is

491

involved in cellular RNA processing and degradation. The RNA exosome complex is a

492

quality control mechanism of the host that regulates mRNA turnover and degrades aberrant

493

RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 might be modulating this pathway for its own benefit.

494

5’-UTR was also found to interact with Lamp2a, which is another key protein involved in

495

quality control processes of the host. Lamp2a is the receptor for the chaperone mediated

496

autophagy (45). Our data shows an increase in autophagic flux in the SARS-CoV-2 infected

497

cells and significant reduction in viral RNA level by inhibition of autophagy. Therefore, it

498

appears that increased autophagic flux promotes SARS-CoV-2 replication, as seen in many

499

other RNA viruses (46). However, there was no change in autophagolysosome formation in

500

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Similar phenomenon is observed in the case of HCV infection

501

(47). Lack of Lamp2 protein increased the level of viral RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 infected

502

cells. Therefore, Lamp2a interaction with the 5’-UTR is unlikely to play a role in promoting

503

viral replication.

504

Lamp2b and Lamp2c isoforms are known to directly interact with RNA and DNA, leading to

505

RNautophagy/DNautophagy (48). Lamp2c is predominantly involved in importing nucleic

506

acids to lysosome for degradation (49). Lamp2 isoforms vary in their C-terminal region.

507

Although SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR interacts with Lamp2a, SiRNA used in our study acts by

508

binding to the 5’ end of the Lamp2 transcript. Therefore, it acts on all Lamp2 variants. The

509

antibody used in our study recognizes all Lamp2 isoforms. However, since Lamp2c

510

overexpression did not affect viral RNA level, it is unlikely that the observed increase in viral

511

RNA level in Lamp2 siRNA treated cells were attributed to a block in RNautophagy.

512

Lamp2a-5’UTR interaction may be involved in delivering viral RNA to endosome, for

513

recognition by TLR7, the sensor for ssRNA. Lamp2a and 5’-UTR interaction may also be

514

involved in sequestering away Lamp2a from inducing chaperone mediated autophagy. At

515

the same time, increased autophagic flux provides energy and prevents apoptosis of the

516

infected cells, which provides a favorable environment to the virus to complete its life cycle.

517

Further studies are required to understand the actual process. Nevertheless, the current

518

study identifies the repertoire of host proteins that associate with the SARS-CoV-2 5’- and

519

3’-UTR and demonstrate a prosurvival role of the host Lamp2 protein against the Virus.

1.0% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50mM Tris, pH 8.0) supplemented with

589

protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 45

590

min at 40C. Free biotin was removed by Macrosep Advance Spin Filter 3K MWCO 20 mL

591

(Cat no. 89131-974, VWR, USA). Aliquots of the samples were stored at -800C for use as

592

input in western blot. Protein concentration in each sample was determined using BCA

593

protein assay kit (Cat no. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) and equal amount

594

of proteins were incubated with “MyOne Streptavidin C1” magnetic beads (Cat no. 65002,

595

Life Technologies, California, USA) on a rotator at 40C for 16 hours. Samples were washed

596

four times with washing buffer, 2X Laemmli buffer was added to the beads and incubated at

597

950C for 45 min. Both input and pull down samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed

598

by western blot using anti-CUGBP1 and GAPDH antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP

599

conjugated secondary antibody was used to detect the protein bands by chemiluminescence

600

(Clarity ECL substrate, Cat no.170-5061, Biorad, California, USA).

601

602

followed by storage at -800C for 20 mins. The precipitates were solubilized in 8M urea. The

603

protein concentration was estimated by BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

604

Massachusetts, USA).

605

In-Solution Digestion and Peptide Separation:

606

Equal amount of protein (10 mg) from each sample was treated with 10 mM DTT (560C, 30

607

min) and alkylated with 20 mM Iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature, 60 min, dark).

608

Trypsin (Cat no. T1426, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) was added to the

609

samples at 1:20 (w/w) ratio and incubated at pH 8, 370C for 24 h. Next, 1% formic acid was

610

added to the samples and peptides were desalted using a SecPak C18 cartridge (Cat no.

611

WAT020515, Waters, Massachusetts, USA) and subsequently lyophilised in a Speed Vac.

612

High capacity streptavidin agarose resins (Cat no. 20361, Thermo Fisher Scientific,

613

Massachusetts, USA) were used to pull down the biotinylated peptides. The beads were

614

washed in binding buffer (50mM Na2HPO4, 150mM NaCl; pH 7.2) before use.

615

Lyophilised peptides were solubilized in 1 mL PBS and incubated with 150 μL washed

616

streptavidin agarose beads for 2 hour at room temperature. Beads were washed once in

617

1mL PBS, once in 1 mL washing buffer (5% acetonitrile in PBS) and finally washed once in

618

ultrapure water. Excess liquid was completely removed from the beads, and biotinylated

619

peptides were eluted by adding 0.3 mL of a solution containing 0.1% formic acid and 80%

620

acetonitrile in water by boiling at 950C for 5 min. A total of 10 elutions were collected and

621

dried together in a Speed Vac. Enriched peptides were desalted with C18 tips (Thermo

622

Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA), and reconstituted with solvent A (2% (v/v)

623

acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water) for LC-MS/MS analysis.

625

LC−MS/MS experiments were performed using Sciex 5600+ Triple-TOF mass spectrometer

626

coupled with ChromXP reversed-phase 3 μm C18-CL trap column (350μm × 0.5 mm, 120 Å,

627

Eksigent, AB Sciex, Massachusetts, USA) and nanoViper C18 separation column (75 μm ×

628

250mm, 3 μm, 100 Å; Acclaim Pep Map, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) in

629

Eksigent nanoLC (Ultra 2D plus) system. The binary mobile solvent system was used as

630

follows: solvent C (2% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water) and solvent B (98%

631

(v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid). The peptides were separated at a flow rate of 200

632

nl/min in a 60 min gradient with total run time of 90 min. The MS data of each condition was

633

acquired in IDA (information-dependent acquisition) with high sensitivity mode. Each cycle

634

consisted of 250 and 100 ms acquisition time for MS1 (m/z 350−1250 Da) and MS/MS (100–

635

1800 m/z) scans, respectively, with a total cycle time of ~2.3s. Each condition was run in

636

triplicate.

637

Protein Identification and Quantification:

638

All raw files (.wiff) were searched using “ProteinPilot” software (version 4.5, SCIEX) with the

639

Mascot algorithm, for protein identification and semi quantitation against the

640

SwissProt_57.15 database (20266 sequences after Homo sapiens taxonomy filter). The

641

search parameters for identification of biotinylated peptides were as follows: (a) trypsin as a

642

proteolytic enzyme (with up to two missed cleavages); (b) peptide mass error tolerance of 20

643

ppm; (c) fragment mass error tolerance of 0.20 Da; and (d) carbamido-methylation of

644

cysteine (+57.02146 Da), oxidation of methionine (+15.99492 Da), deamination of NQ

645

(+0.98416) and biotinylation of lysine (+226.07759 Da) as variable modifications. Quality of

646

data between different samples and replicates were monitored by Pearson-correlation plot of

647

peptide intensity against each run.

648

Data analysis:

649

Proteins with at least one corrected biotinylated peptide and ³ 15 PEP score were

650

considered to be identified successfully, extracted from the gaussian smooth curve. Next, all

651

data were analyzed using a web based tool, Bioinformatics & Evolutionary Genomics

652

(http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) to generate the venn diagram to identify

653

proteins that are unique interaction partner of 5’-300 and 3’-203 RNA. The background

654

subtracted dataset was sorted on the basis of following parameters (minimum 2 unique

655

peptides and “Prot score” of 40 or more) to generate the final list of proteins, which were

656

considered for further studies (see Table 1). The mass spectrometry proteomics data have

657

been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository.

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

749

Confocal imaging was performed as described (50). In brief, Huh7 and Vero E6 cells were

750

fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temp, followed by incubation in blocking

751

buffer (4% BSA in PBS) for 1 hour at room temp and incubation with Lamp2 and LC3b

752

antibodies (1:50 and 1:50 dilution, respectively) in antibody dilution buffer (3% BSA in

753

PBS+0.1% Tween-20) for 16 hours, at 40C. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS,

754

followed by incubation with 1:500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and 1:500

755

dilution of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

756

Massachusetts, USA) in antibody dilution buffer at room temp for 1 hour. Coverslips were

757

washed three times in PBS and mounted on glass slides using antifade gold reagent

758

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Images were acquired using a 60X

759

objective in a confocal microscope (Olympus FV3000) and analysed by Image lab FIJI

760

software.

762

Western blot assay

763

Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.4µ PVDF membrane. Membranes

764

were blocked for 1 hour at room temp using 5% skimmed milk (in PBS). Next, membranes

765

were incubated with primary antibody overnight in PBST (PBS+0.05% Tween-20) + 5%

766

skimmed milk at 40C. Blots were washed 3 times in PBST, followed by incubation with HRP-

767

tagged secondary antibody at room temp for 1 hour. Blots were washed 3 times in PBST

768

and protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using a commercially

769

available kit (Bio Rad, California, USA).
