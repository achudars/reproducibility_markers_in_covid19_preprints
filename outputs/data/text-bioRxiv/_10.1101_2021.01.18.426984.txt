Abstract:
Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom
that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. This variant has an
unusually large number of mutations with 10 amino acid changes in the spike protein,
raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here, we

20

investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or
the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial
with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had equivalent
neutralizing titers to both variants. These data, together with the combined immunity

involving humoral and cellular effectors induced by this vaccine, make it unlikely that the
B.1.1.7 lineage will escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.

Main Text:

In a pivotal phase 3 trial conducted in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa,
Germany, and Turkey, the BioNTech-Pfizer mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 was 95% effective
in preventing COVID-19 through the data cut-off date of November 14, 2020 (1). In
September 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was detected in the United Kingdom
(2), and it subsequently increased in prevalence, showed enhanced transmissibility, and

10

spread to other countries and continents (3). B.1.1.7 has a series of mutations in its spike
(S) protein: ΔH69/V70, ΔY144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and
D1118H. One of these mutations, N501Y, was of particular concern because it is located
in the receptor binding site, the spike with this mutation binds more tightly to its cellular
receptor, ACE-2 (4); and virus with this mutation has an increased host range that

15

includes mice (5). BNT162b2-immune sera neutralized SARS-CoV-2 (USA/WA-1/2020
background strain) with an introduced N501Y mutation as efficiently as SARS-CoV-2
without the mutation (6). Further, 19 pseudoviruses, each bearing a SARS-CoV-2 S with
a different mutation found in circulating strains, were also neutralized as efficiently as nonmutant SARS-CoV-2 S bearing pseudoviruses by BNT162b2-immune sera (7).

20

Nevertheless, the question remained whether a virus with the full set of mutations in the
lineage B.1.1.7 spike would be neutralized efficiently by BNT162b2-immune sera.
To answer this question, we generated VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing the
Wuhan reference strain or the lineage B.1.1.7 spike protein (Fig S1). Sera of 16

participants in the previously reported German phase 1/2 trial (7), drawn from eight
younger (18-55 yrs) and eight older adults (56-85 yrs) at 21 days after the booster
immunization with 30 µg BNT162b2 (Fig S2), were tested for neutralization of SARSCoV-2 Wuhan and lineage B.1.1.7 spike-pseudotyped VSV by a 50% neutralization assay
5

(pVNT50). The ratio of the 50% neutralization geometric mean titer (GMT) of the sera
against the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 spike-pseudotyped VSV to that against the
Wuhan reference spike-pseudotyped VSV was 0.79, indicating no biologically significant
difference in neutralization activity against the two pseudoviruses (Fig. 1, Fig. S3, Table
S1).

The preserved neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing the B.1.1.7 spike by BNT162b2immune sera makes it very unlikely that the UK variant viruses will escape BNT162b2mediated protection. A potential limitation of the work may be the use of a non-replicating
pseudovirus system. However, previous reports have shown good concordance between
pseudotype neutralization and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays (8, 9). Additional

15

experiments will confirm efficient neutralization of B.1.1.7 lineage clinical isolates. The
ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates continuous monitoring of the significance
of changes for maintained protection by currently authorized vaccines. Unlike for
influenza vaccines, the reduction in neutralization that might indicate the need for a strain
change has not been established for COVID-19 vaccines. Given the polyepitopic immune

20

response with concurrent activation of neutralizing antibodies and T cells, and thus
multiple potential mediators of protection elicited by BNT162b2, it is possible that vaccine
efficacy could be preserved, even with substantial losses of neutralization by vaccineelicited sera. Nevertheless, preserved neutralization is reassuring, and preparation for

potential COVID-19 vaccine strain change is prudent. Such an adaptation of the vaccine
to a new virus strain would be facilitated by the flexibility of mRNA-based vaccine
technology.
