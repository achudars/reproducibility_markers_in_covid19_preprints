SUMMARY
The need for SARS-CoV-2 next-generation vaccines has been highlighted by the rise of variants of concern
(VoC) and the long-term threat of other coronaviruses. Here, we designed and characterized four categories
of engineered nanoparticle immunogens that recapitulate the structural and antigenic properties of prefusion
Spike (S), S1 and RBD. These immunogens induced robust S-binding, ACE2-inhibition, and authentic and
pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. A Spike-ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN)
vaccine elicited neutralizing titers more than 20-fold higher than convalescent donor serum, following a
single immunization, while RBD-Ferritin nanoparticle (RFN) immunogens elicited similar responses after
two immunizations. Passive transfer of IgG purified from SpFN- or RFN-immunized mice protected K18hACE2 transgenic mice from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge. Furthermore, SpFN- and RFNimmunization elicited ACE2 blocking activity and neutralizing ID50 antibody titers >2,000 against SARSCoV-1, along with high magnitude neutralizing titers against major VoC. These results provide design
strategies for pan-coronavirus vaccine development.

INTRODUCTION
Seven coronaviruses (CoV) cause disease in humans, with three of these, SARS-CoV-1, MERSCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 having emerged since 2003 (Cui et al., 2019) and displaying high
mortality rates. SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted by humans and created a pandemic,
infecting over 100 million people, causing over 2 million deaths to date, and resulting in an
urgent need for protective and durable vaccines. Rapid vaccine development in a worldwide
effort, led to the evaluation of hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates and rapid
worldwide vaccine distribution and use.
The response to SARS-CoV-2 was facilitated by multiple efforts over the last decade
to enable CoV pandemic preparedness, initially based on MERS-CoV vaccine design and
development (Wang et al., 2015), phase I vaccine trials (Modjarrad et al., 2019), and a global
effort by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to advance vaccine
candidates (Plotkin, 2017). The elucidation of CoV Spike (S) glycoprotein structures
(Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2016) allowed structure-based vaccine design of
stabilized S glycoprotein immunogens from multiple CoVs (Pallesen et al., 2017), providing
a blueprint for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design (Corbett et al., 2020).
The CoV S protein mediates virus entry, is immunogenic (Iyer et al., 2020; Wang et al.,
2021) and encodes multiple neutralizing epitopes (Greaney et al., 2021) making it the
primary target for natural and vaccine-induced CoV humoral immunity and vaccine design
(Jiang et al., 2020) and the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. S is a class I fusion glycoprotein
consisting of a S1 attachment subunit and S2 fusion subunit that remain non-covalently
associated in a metastable, heterotrimeric S on the virion surface (Walls et al., 2020). In the
S1 subunit, there is a N-terminal domain (NTD), and C-terminal domain (CTD) that includes
the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD binds to the human angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (hACE2) facilitating cell entry (Lan et al., 2020). Multiple antigenic sites have been
identified on the S protein, including distinct sites on the RBD and the S1 domain, including
an NTD supersite (Brouwer et al., 2020; Cerutti et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020).
Convalescent serum antibodies or monoclonal antibodies capable of potently inhibiting
infection in vitro can reduce disease severity or mortality in rodents, non-human primates
(Barnes et al., 2020) and humans (Duan et al., 2020; Salazar et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020).
Due to the unknown parameters of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine durability, specific age- or
population-needs, emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) (Wibmer et al.,
2020), and the constant threat of emerging CoV pathogens (Menachery et al., 2015), secondgeneration COVID-19 or pan-sarbecovirus vaccines will be needed. Iterative structure-based
design for viral glycoproteins (McLellan et al., 2013; Joyce et al., 2016) stabilizing
neutralizing epitopes or epitope-based vaccine design (Chen et al., 2021; Kong et al., 2019)
show that rational vaccine design can lead to the elicitation of broad immune responses.
Broad cross-reactive responses elicited by engineered vaccines have also been advanced for
influenza (Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020; Kanekiyo et al., 2019). In the case of CoVs, a set of
cross-reactive epitopes have recently been described (Barnes et al., 2020; Joyce et al., 2020;
Sauer et al., 2021; Wrapp et al., 2020), with many of the preferred neutralizing antibodies
centered on the RBD domain (Li et al., 2021; Pinto et al., 2020; Rappazzo et al., 2021).
Next-generation strategies to augment specific immune responses as well as enhance
cross-reactivity include the use of nanoparticle vaccine technology (Cohen et al., 2021) and
next-generation adjuvants. Nanoparticle technologies have been shown to improve antigen

structure and stability, as well as vaccine targeted delivery, immunogenicity, with good
safety profiles (Pati et al., 2018). Engineered nanoparticle-vaccines can elicit broader
immune responses (Darricarrere et al., 2021; Kanekiyo et al., 2019; Kanekiyo et al., 2013)
or more efficacious immune responses (Kanekiyo et al., 2015). The repetitive array of the
viral surface component allows for robust B-cell activation facilitating memory B cell
expansion and generation of long-lived plasma cells. More recently, in efforts to generate
more effective vaccines that can prevent infection by resistant pathogens such as HIV-1 or
Influenza, a set of engineered nanoparticle vaccines have been developed. Utilizing naturally
occurring nanoparticle molecules such as bacterial ferritin, antigens are fused to the ferritin
molecule to recapitulate complex trimeric class I glycoproteins, and to increase the immune
response for weakly immunogenic targets. Nanoparticle technologies have also been shown
to improve antigen structure and stability, as well as vaccine targeted delivery,
immunogenicity and safety (Pati et al., 2018). Recently designed single and multi-component
nanoparticle vaccines (Brouwer et al., 2021; Walls et al., 2020) show promise from both an
immunological (Cawlfield et al., 2019; Marcandalli et al., 2019) and a cGMP production
perspective (Ueda et al., 2020).
Engineered nanoparticle vaccines and their capacity to generate enhanced immune
responses in humans are currently being studied and include influenza (NCT03186781;
NCT03814720; NCT04579250), Epstein-Barr virus (NCT04645147), malaria
(NCT04296279) and a recently described SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle vaccine (IVX-411)
(Walls et al., 2020). Use of potent adjuvants such as liposomal-saponin adjuvants can further
enhance the protective immune response (Cawlfield et al., 2019; Lal et al., 2015; Om et al.,
2020) even in the context of nanoparticle vaccines (Langowski et al., 2020) (Kaba et al.,
2018). Based on the results described herein and data from associated non-human primate
experiments (Joyce et al., 2021; King et al., 2021), a S-Ferritin immunogen with a liposomal
adjuvant, ALFQ is currently being assessed in a phase I clinical trial (NCT04784767).
Here we report the structure-based design and pre-clinical assessment of four
categories of S-domain ferritin nanoparticles including stabilized S-trimer-ferritin
nanoparticles (SpFN), RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RFN), S1-ferritin nanoparticles, and RBDNTD-ferritin nanoparticles. By using a set of biophysical, structural, and antigenic
assessments, combined with animal immunogenicity testing, we identify multiple
immunogens that elicit substantial neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and
related VoC. These antibody levels provide robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge
in the K18-hACE2 mouse model. We further show that subsequent immunizations not only
increase the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titer, but also expand the neutralization breadth and
titer against the heterologous SARS-CoV-1 virus. These data provide multiple immunogen
design strategies for pan-betacoronavirus vaccine development.
RESULTS

Immunogen Design of SARS-CoV-2 S-domain Ferritin Nanoparticles
Using the initial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence (Genbank: MN9089473), we designed four
categories of S-domain ferritin-fusion recombinant proteins as immunogens for expression
as nanoparticles based on the major antigenic domains of the S ectodomain (Figure S1). The
Helicobacter pylori ferritin molecule was genetically linked to the C-terminal region of the

following S antigens (i) S ectodomain (residues 12-1158) (ii) RBD (residues 331-527), (iii)
RBD linked in tandem to the NTD (residues 12-303), and (iv) S1 (residues 12-696) (Figure
1, Figure S1, and Table S1). In the case of the Spike ferritin nanoparticle designs, a short
linker to the ferritin molecule was used to utilize the natural three-fold axis, for display of
eight Spikes. In the case of the other designs, a short region of bullfrog ferritin was utilized
to allow equidistant distribution of the 24 S-domain molecules on the ferritin surface (Figure
1). Our overall approach was to compare and contrast the immunogen structures,
antigenicity, immunogenicity elicited by these different immunogens with the goal to
identify the best immunogen to take forward into further development.
The first design category, Spike ferritin nanoparticle designs were based on a
modified S with stabilizing prolines (K986P, V987P), removal of the furin cleavage site (RRAS
to GSAS), and optimization of the coiled coil region between hinge 1 and hinge 2 of the
ectodomain stalk (Turonova et al., 2020) to stabilize trimer formation on the Ferritin scaffold
(Figure 1A and S1). The designs focused on (i) modification of the end of the S molecule
(1137, 1208, 1154, or 1158), (ii) optimization of the coiled-coil region through extensions or
repeats, (iii) removal of the coiled-coil region, (iv) removal of glycan 1158, (v) addition of
heterogenous trimerization domains (GCN4, or foldon), or (vi) signal peptide sequence
(Figure 1B, and Table S1).
The second design category, RBD ferritin nanoparticle designs used the SARS-CoV-2
RBD (residues 331-527) (Figure 1C) connected to the bullfrog-H. pylori chimeric ferritin
(Kanekiyo et al., 2015) by a 6 amino acid linker (Figure 1D). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD contains
a set of hydrophobic patches, including the ACE2 binding site, and a region located about
residue 518 that is covered in the context of the intact S molecule. These regions were
iteratively mutated to reduce hydrophobicity, and increase stability of the RFN molecules,
expression levels, and antigenicity and immunogenicity.
The third design category, RBD-NTD ferritin molecules were based on addition of
optimized RBD molecules in series with an NTD-Ferritin construct (residues 12-303) linked
to the bullfrog-H. pylori chimeric ferritin molecule. The in-series, but reversed RBD-NTD
design ensured distal displacement of the RBD molecule from the ferritin molecule (Figure
1E), promoting immune recognition of the RBD molecule with potential benefits for the
production and stability of the nanoparticle.
The fourth design category, S1 ferritin design SARS-CoV-2 S (residues 12 - 676)
(Figure 1F, and Table S1) was initially designed based on the MERS S1 immunogen which
elicited protective immune responses (Wang et al., 2015). Subsequent designs focused on
inclusion of a short region of SARS-CoV-2 S2 (residues 689-696) either using the connecting
region that overlaps with the furin site, or by use of a short glycine-rich linker sequence
(Figure 1F) to enable formation of the S1-Ferritin nanoparticle (Figure 1G).

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S-domain ferritin nanoparticles

Ten S-ferritin constructs (Table S1) were initially designed and tested for expression, yield,
nanoparticle formation, and antigenicity. S-ferritin nanoparticles were expressed in
Expi293F cells for 3-5 days at 34 oC and 37 oC and purified by GNA lectin affinity
chromatography. A subset of these constructs showed reasonable expression levels ranging
from 0.5 to 5 mg/L media supernatant (Figure S3). pCoV1B-05 and pCoV1B-06-PL (SpFN)
typically yielded over 5 mg/L with expression incubation set at 34 oC. Samples were

assessed by SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic light scattering
(DLS), and negative-stain electron microscopy (neg-EM) to ensure intact protein was
produced, and to assess the nanoparticle formation, and S morphology (Figure 2 and . For
all SpFN constructs that showed expression as visualized by SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A),
nanoparticles were observed by SEC, DLS, and neg-EM (Figure 2E, and 2F). In the case of
SpFN and SpFN_1B-08 (Figure S2), the globular shape of the protruding S was clearly
visible in both the TEM images and the 2D averages. In the case of the pCoV1B-05, the
protruding S showed more of an âopenâ form in both the TEM images and the 2D averages.
Nanoparticles were assessed for nanoparticle formation, and assessed for
antigenicity using biolayer interferometry against a set of poorly neutralizing (CR3022,
SR1), and potently neutralizing (SR2, SR3, SR4, SR5) RBD-targeting antibodies. The
different S-ferritin designs showed variable binding to the antibodies, with SpFN having
the highest binding (Figure 3A and Figure S1).
Initial test expression of RBD-Ferritin constructs at 37 oC using either 293F or
Expi293F cells showed low levels of expression. Reducing the cell expression temperature
to between 30 oC to 34 oC following transfection rescued expression and enabled levels >
20 mg/L to be purified by NiNTA purification (Figure S3). However, analysis of the
constructs by SEC, DLS, and neg-EM indicated that initial RBD-Ferritin constructs did not
form fully intact nanoparticles (Figure S2). We hypothesized that designed variants with
reduced RBD surface hydrophobicity would allow for improved nanoparticle yield.
Screening through a set of variants using SDS-PAGE and SEC as primary indicators of
nanoparticle formation allowed identification of constructs that readily formed
nanoparticles (Figure 2 and Figure S1 and S2B). These molecules were also visualized by
neg-EM, and showed clear formation of nanoparticles, with the protruding RBD domain
visible on their surface in both TEM images and 2D class averages (Figure 2F). However,
these constructs had a propensity to form soluble or insoluble aggregates and dramatically
affected the ability to concentrate the samples. Addition of 5% glycerol to the NiNTA
purified material, prior to SEC or other concentration steps, mitigated the aggregation issue
and increased the nanoparticle formation as judged by SEC, and was confirmed by neg-EM.
The RBD-Ferritin constructs showed very strong binding to the set of RBD-specific
antibodies in all cases (Figure S3E). The level of binding was approximately twice that seen
for the S-ferritin constructs, indicative of the exposed and accessible nature of the RBD
epitopes (Figure 2G).
Due to the initial difficulty with S1-Ferritin nanoparticle constructs, we developed a
set of engineered S1 constructs by artificially connecting the RBD domain by a short linker
to NTD linked to the Ferritin molecule and denoted as RBD-NTD ferritin molecules. This
multi-domain strategy resulted in good expression and nanoparticle formation. Using the
information gained from the RBD surface optimization, we designed multiple constructs
with variations in the RBD molecule to reduce surface hydrophobicity (Figure S1).
Antigenic analysis of these constructs showed that pCoV146 displayed robust antibodybinding (Figure 2F).
The initial S1-Ferritin construct, pCoV68 (residues 12-676) yielded very low protein
expression levels, even with reduced expression temperatures(Figure S3A). However,
using the structure of the S-2P molecule (Wrapp et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020), it was clear
that a short segment of the S2 formed significant interactions with the S1 domain. Addition
of this short region either using the natural sequence (with furin site removed) as in

construct pCoV109, or by linking residues 689-696 with glycine-rich linkers as in construct
pCoV111 allowed ~ 1 mg/L of protein to be purified. Analysis of these constructs by SDSPAGE, SEC, and neg-EM showed clear formation of the designed nanoparticles, and
antigenic characterization showed binding of antibodies to the nanoparticle (Figure 2G).
Further structural analysis of the nanoparticle immunogens from each of the four
design categories was carried out by determining 3D reconstructions from negative-stain
electron micrographs (Figure 4). For each nanoparticle, a central sphere of approximately
12 nm corresponding to ferritin was resolved. S-domain antigens were located a short
distance away from the central sphere and linker regions were unresolved likely due to
their small size and flexibility. The SpFN_1B-06-PL reconstruction showed the stabilized S
protruding from the ferritin molecule with a total diameter of approximately 44 nm (Figure
4A). The large size and distinct low-resolution features of the S ectodomain allowed for
docking of a closed S-2P trimer model (PDB ID: 6VXX) into the trimer density, confirming
the S was in the prefusion conformation. The ferritin-distal region of the S density was
slightly weaker and likely reflects the heterogeneity in RBD-up conformations or slight
openings of trimer visible in raw micrographs. Additionally, although the coiled-coil was
unresolved, the distances between the density for S and ferritin matched the modeled
coiled-coil length. Reconstruction of the three-dimensional RFN_131 EM map revealed two
globular densities per asymmetric unit, suggesting that the RBD molecule was highly
flexible on the surface of the ferritin sphere (Figure 4B). Similarly, the map of the RBDNTD-ferritin fusion, pCoV146, showed two layers of globular densities, with a ferritinproximal layer corresponding to the NTD domain and a more disordered layer for the RBD
domain (Figure 4C). This particle was approximately 9nm larger in 2D and 3D than the
single domain RFN molecule. The reconstruction of the S1-Ferritin fusion pCoV111
revealed a surprisingly ordered S1 density compared to the flexible RBD-NTD fusion,
perhaps due to geometric constraints on the surface of the ferritin particle (Figure 4D). A
density similar in shape to the S1 domain in the closed S2P trimer was resolved although it
was slightly more compact, likely due to both overall flexibility of the S1 on the ferritin
surface and RBD flexibility.

Immunogenicity of the four categories of SARS-CoV-2 S-domain ferritin nanoparticles
in mice
To evaluate the immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 ferritin-nanoparticles, we typically
utilized two strains of mice (C57BL/6, and BALB/c), two adjuvants (ALFQ, and Alhydrogelï),
and immunized mice three-times intramuscularly at 3-week intervals using a 10 Î¼g dose. In
total, we assessed 14 immunogens, two Spike ferritin immunogens, seven RBD ferritin
immunogens, one S1-Ferritin construct, and four RBD-NTD ferritin immunogens (Table S2).
Assessment in immunogenicity studies was based on iterative knowledge of immunogen
physical and biochemical characteristics (Figure 2 and 3, and Figure S3), in conjunction with
immunogenicity results from first-generation immunogens (Figure S1). This facilitated
down-selection of lead immunogen candidates. Alhydrogelï and ALFQ adjuvants were
selected due to their history in human vaccine trials, safety profile, and previous
performance alongside nanoparticle vaccine immunogens (NCT04296279). Alhydrogelï
contains aluminum hydroxide gel, while ALFQ is a liposome-based adjuvant containing the

saponin QS-21, and synthetic Monophosphoryl Lipid A (3D-PHADï). We assessed SARS-CoV2 RBD- and S-binding, RBD-ACE2-inhibition, pseudovirus neutralizing antibody responses
and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (Figure 4).
All four categories of immunogens elicited robust SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. In
all cases tested, ALFQ was superior to Alhydrogelï as an adjuvant for elicitation of binding
and neutralizing responses (Figure S4). In addition, Alhydrogelï led to a skewed antibody
isotype immune response that was TH2 in nature, as opposed to the balanced immune
response seen with ALFQ adjuvanted animals (Figure S4G). Immune responses seen in
C57BL/6 mice were greater than for BALB/c mice after a single immunization, while binding
and neutralizing antibody titers were comparable after a second or third immunization
(Figure 5). In all cases, the third immunization did not dramatically increase the antibody
levels induced by the S-domain ferritin nanoparticles.
The SpFN immunogen elicited a rapid RBD-binding, and pseudovirus neutralizing
antibody response with ID50 geometric mean titer (GMT) >10,000 in C57BL/6 mice and
>1,000 after a single immunization (Figure 5C and Figure S4). This rapid neutralizing
immune response after one immunization was significantly higher than seen with RBD
ferritin or RBD-NTD ferritin immunogens. Following a second immunization, both strains of
SpFN-vaccinated mice showed ID50 GMT >10,000 and ID80 GMT >5,000 for both mouse types.
RBD ferritin immunogens elicited robust RBD and S-binding responses, ACE2inhibition, and pseudovirus neutralization ID50 GMT >10,000 in both mice strains after two
immunizations (Figure 5A-C). We assessed seven RFN immunogen designs in
immunogenicity studies (Table S3) and selection for animal immunogenicity experiments
was largely based on nanoparticle stability, expression levels, aggregation, and antigenic
profile (Figure 2-3 and Figure S2, S3). Based on these criteria, pCoV131 (RFN) was
extensively assessed, and after three immunizations, showed pseudovirus neutralization
responses that were comparable or exceeded that seen for the SpFN_1B-06-PL immunogen.
Of note, the RFN immunogens elicited substantial S binding responses that were highly
comparable to that of other immunogens that contained additional S domains (Figure 5B).
In a pattern similar to that seen for the RBD ferritin immunogens, both the RBD-NTD
ferritin and the S1 ferritin immunogens elicited binding responses, and detectable
pseudovirus neutralization after a single immunization that were increased by the second
immunization to give ID50 GMT values >10,000, and ID80 GMT titers ~5,000 (Figure 5A-C and
Figure S4).
Given the rapid elicitation of immune responses after a single immunization by
SpFN_1B-06-PL, we further characterized this immunogen in a dose-ranging study (Figure
S5 and Figure 5D and 5E). In five-fold dilution steps, we reduced the SpFN_1B-06-PL
immunogen from a 10 Î¼g dose down to a 0.0032 Î¼g dose (3,125-fold reduction) with the full
ALFQ adjuvant dose. Antibody binding responses were assessed for the full dose range by
ELISA to S and RBD, and binding responses were elicited at all dose concentrations tested.
We then further assessed the 0.08 Î¼g dose (125-fold reduction from the 10 Î¼g dose) with all
our immunogenicity assays (Figure 5D and Figure S5G). At this dose, the immune response
was comparable to that seen for the typical 10 Î¼g dose. In addition, we assessed both the 10
and 0.08 Î¼g SpFN_1B-06-PL vaccinated-mouse serum for authentic SARS-CoV-2 live virus
neutralization. At both doses, in both mouse strains, a single immunization elicited ID50 GMT
of ~ 1,000, while the second immunization boosted this response more than ten-fold. The

subsequent third immunization showed a modest boost effect. At each of these study time
points, there was no difference between the doses in C57BL/6 mice, while differences in
BALB/c ID80 GMT were seen at week 2 (higher for the 10 Î¼g dose) and week 8 (higher for
the 0.08 Î¼g dose). Overall, these studies demonstrated robust immunogenicity of four
categories of SARS-CoV-2 S-domain ferritin nanoparticles.
Protective Immunity in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge

Given the neutralizing antibody response seen with SpFN, and RFN, and the different
design of these two immunogens, we chose to assess antibodies from these animals in a
lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge model using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. The dose of SARSCoV-2 virus was titrated to establish significant weight loss and pathology following
infection with WA strain (Figure S6). Given previously described studies (Zheng et al.,
2021), we sought to assess the vaccine-elicited antibody responses at levels starting at
about 1,000 and we passively transferred three different amounts of purified IgG from
either SpFN- or RFN-immunized mice 24 h prior to infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6A,
6B). The control groups included a PBS group and a group that was passively transferred
with naÃ¯ve mouse IgG.
Animal weight was measured twice daily for 14 days after challenge, and animals
that lost > 25% weight during the study were euthanized. All animals that received the
highest amount of antibody (470 Î¼g SpFN-derived, or 370 Î¼g RFN-derived) showed
neutralization ID50 GMT titers of 1,713 and 1,179 respectively (Figure 6C). All animals in
these two groups showed minimal weight loss (Figure 6D), and all animals survived the
study (Figure 6E). In the two groups that received either 47 Î¼g SpFN- or 37 Î¼g RFN-derived
antibody, neutralization ID50 GMT titers were 89, and 248 respectively. Even with these
modest antibody transfer amounts and the relatively low neutralization titers, most
animals were protected from weight loss and death. In the SpFN-47 Î¼g group, only two
animals showed severe weight loss, while in the RFN-37 Î¼g group, most animals showed
some weight loss during the first study week, but all recovered. In contrast, mice that
received the lowest amount of purified IgG from SpFN- or RFN-vaccinated animals, did not
show any neutralizing antibody titers at the day of infection. The mice in these two groups
showed significant weight loss, and 9/10 animals in each group were euthanized by day 9
of the study. In a similar pattern, all animals from the naÃ¯ve IgG and PBS groups suffered
weight loss and were euthanized by study day 8. In summary, these data show that low
amounts of passively transferred antibodies from SpFN or RFN vaccinated animals can
protect mice from a lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-2.
Vaccine-elicited broadly cross-reactive antibody responses against SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2

SARS-CoV-2 variants that are more transmissible and appear to be more lethal continue to
emerge even in the midst of rapid vaccine roll out and public-health measures. Given the
robust binding, pseudovirus and authentic virus neutralization titers against the original
SARS-CoV-2, that were elicited by the S-domain ferritin nanoparticle immunogens, we
assessed the immunized mouse sera for binding and pseudovirus neutralization to the VoC
(Figure 7). Using study week 10 sera from mice immunized with the four categories of

immunogens SpFN_1B-06-PL, RFN_131, pCoV146, and pCoV111 (S1-Ferritin), we assessed
binding to a panel of variant RBD molecules containing K417N, E484K, N501Y, and
combinations of these mutations (Figure 7A). These mutations match to the RBD sequence
seen in the B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 strains. In all cases, robust binding to the
RBD molecules were observed, with minimal change in overall binding when compared to
the original RBD molecule. RFN-immunized mouse sera showed reduced binding to the
E484K, N501Y double mutant, but increased binding to the K417N variant. Analysis of the
sera from SpFN-, RFN, or pCoV111-immunized mice for pseudovirus neutralization of VoCs
B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 showed minimal changes in the neutralization levels, with ID50 values >
2,000 for all strains (Figure 7B).
Analysis of the mouse sera for binding or neutralization of SARS-CoV-1 showed that
RFN-immunized mice elicited the highest SARS-CoV-1 RBD binding response (Figure 7C).
In addition, to RBD binding, we also observed SARS-CoV-1 ACE2-RBD inhibitory activity
with the SpFN-immunized mice (Figure S5). We further assessed the SpFN- or RFNimmunized mouse sera for neutralization against SARS-CoV-1 using the pseudovirus assay
(Figure 7D). We observed robust neutralization levels with ID50 > 1,000 for the
SpFN_1B06-PL or the RFN_131 immunized animals. In general, the RFN molecule elicited
higher SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing responses compared to the SpFN-immunized animals.
Together, these data demonstrate that the S-domain ferritin nanoparticles elicit broadly
neutralizing and cross-reactive antibody responses against VoC and heterologous SARSCoV-1.
DISCUSSION

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, multiple vaccines have been developed that
elicit robust and protective immune responses in small animals, non-human primates, and
humans. This includes a set of mRNA-based vaccines (NIH-Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech), viral
vector vaccines (J&J, Astra Zeneca), and a nanoparticle-like vaccine (Novavax) (Bangaru et
al., 2020) that are starting to be distributed worldwide, and include SARS-CoV-2 S as the
major vaccine component. In addition, next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates are
beginning to reveal strong immunological results in pre-clinical studies (Saunders et al.,
2021; Walls et al., 2020). These protein-based nanoparticle platforms paired with powerful
adjuvant systems provide multiple advantages in the ability to protect against emerging
variants (Moyo-Gwete et al., 2021; Wibmer et al., 2021). Nanoparticle vaccines may be
critical for specific high-risk professions, or in populations where immune response titers
are of particular importance (Atyeo et al., 2021) including the elderly (Collier et al., 2021) or
immunocompromised (Boyarsky et al., 2021). The utility of highly stable vaccines that can
elicit high neutralizing antibody titers after a single immunization, or vaccines that can be
easily re-purposed for specific populations or as boosting immunogens is likely to help the
long-term strategy for global COVID-19 vaccination.
Trimer-functionalized ferritin vaccines have been effective at eliciting neutralizing
antibodies against class I fusion proteins, including influenza haemagglutinin (Kanekiyo et
al., 2013; Kelly et al., 2020) and HIV envelope (He et al., 2016; Sliepen et al., 2015) as well as
engineered nanoparticles including RBD-12GS-I53-50 (Walls et al., 2020). For example, in
the case of respiratory syncytial virus, a stabilized prefusion Fusion glycoprotein vaccine
based on subtype A can naturally elicit potent neutralizing antibody and T cell responses

against the heterologous subtype B in animals and humans (Crank et al., 2019; Joyce et al.,
2019). Here we developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 S-domain ferritin nanoparticle vaccines using
structure-based vaccine design that recreate the structural and antigenic profile of S. These
immunogens elicit antibodies with potent S-binding activity, hACE2-blocking activity, and
potent neutralization activity against the homologous virus. In all four immunogen-design
groups, antibody responses target the RBD domain and this response significantly
contributes to the high neutralization responses. Additionally, dose-sparing immunization
experiments show that significant antigen reduction can still elicit potent antibody
responses, while simultaneously also showing robust levels of neutralizing antibodies
against the heterologous SARS-CoV-1. This heterologous immune response is reminiscent of
broad immune responses seen with Ferritin-HA immunogens (Kanekiyo et al., 2013), and
demonstrate how nanoparticle immunogens can enhance the quality of the humoral immune
response. Naturally occurring nanoparticle vaccines such as Yellow Fever 17D vaccine
(Collins and Barrett, 2017) and human papillomavirus virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines
(Lowy and Schiller, 2006) elicit robust and long-lived immune responses. For SARS-CoV-2
vaccine development, nanoparticles performed well in mouse (Keech et al., 2020; Walls et
al., 2020) and non-human primate studies (Brouwer et al., 2021), with a designed S-Ferritin
nanoparticle also resulting in robust immunogenicity in mouse studies (Powell et al., 2021).
Furthermore, the passive-transfer of vaccine-elicited purified antibody prevented
death and significant weight loss in a high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in the K18-hACE2
mouse model at neutralizing antibody levels that were routinely exceeded by SpFN- or RFNvaccination. We also transferred very low amounts of antibody to the K18-hACE2 mice to
assess for antibody dependent enhancement, and we saw no indication of faster weight loss,
or enhanced symptoms in the mice. The fact that antibody amounts readily elicited after a
single immunization are highly protective in this challenge model, and that low antibody
levels do not enhance disease, highlights the promise of these vaccine candidates. A set of
companion papers also maps out the cellular immune response and highlights the protective
effect of SpFN and RFN in high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies (Joyce et al., 2021; King
et al., 2021). Given the rapid elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses after a single
immunization and the highly protective responses seen in the K18-hACE2 model, SpFN_1B06-PL has been produced under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) conditions
and is under assessment in an ongoing phase I clinical trial (NCT04784767).
The immune responses elicited by the ferritin nanoparticles with the adjuvant ALFQ
were consistently superior to that seen with the aluminum hydroxidebased Alhydrogel
adjuvant. This result is consistent with other studies indicating that aluminum hydroxide is
sub-optimal at inducing SARS-COV-2 neutralizing antibody responses [ref]. The
components of the ALFQ adjuvant including QS-21, are used in multiple industrial
processes and scaled up for future advanced clinical trials. The COVID-19 pandemic has set
many precedents in regard to vaccine development speed, novel platforms, and should
garner a new age of vaccine development utilizing advanced antigens and adjuvants to
train the immune response for increased protection.
Here, we utilized structure-based design to create four categories of immunogens using the
ferritin-nanoparticle platform. Each of these different designs and the underlying
development processes provide a greater understanding and framework for ongoing and
future pan-coronavirus vaccine design and development. The design information outlined
here can be readily transferred for emerging CoV pathogens or other ubiquitous âcommon11

and cyan with regions membrane-proximal from hinge 2 colored in white. The
transmembrane domain of all chains is depicted in yellow. To design a Spike-Ferritin
molecule, the C-terminal heptad repeat (residues 1140 to 1161) between Hinge 1 and 2
were aligned to an ideal heptad repeat sequence. Residues in the native S sequence which
break this pattern are highlighted in red. These residues are also labeled and highlighted in
red on the 3D-structure. Two engineered designs (1B-05 and 1B-06) are shown, with S end
residue used to link to Ferritin, and heptad-repeat mutations colored green.
(B) Schematic and 3D model of Spike Ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN). Differences between the
native S sequence and the engineered nanoparticle are indicated on the schematic. A 3Dmodel of SpFN displaying eight trimeric Spikes was created using PDB ID 6VXX and 3EGM
with the ferritin molecule shown in alternating grey and white. The nanoparticle is
depicted along the 4-fold and the 3-fold symmetry axes of the ferritin.
(C) RBDâFerritin nanoparticle design and optimization. The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB
ID:6MOJ) is shown in surface representation, with the ACE2 binding site outlined in dashed
lines. Three hydrophobic regions of the RBD which were mutated for nanoparticle
immunogen design are shown in light green surface, with residues in stick representation.
The ACE2 binding site contains two of these regions, while a third hydrophobic patch near
the C-terminus of the RBD is typically buried by S2 and part of S1 in the context of the
trimer molecule.
(D) Schematic and 3D model of an RBDâFerritin nanoparticle. A modeled 24-mer
nanoparticle displaying the RBD domain is depicted at the 3-fold symmetry axis of ferritin
and colored green. Truncation points, linkers, and alterations made to the RBD sequence
are indicated on the schematic.
(E) Schematic and 3D model of an RBDâNTDâFerritin nanoparticle. A modeled nanoparticle
displaying RBD and NTD epitopes is depicted and colored according to the schematic.
Truncation points, linkers, and alterations made to the native S sequence are indicated on
the primary structure.
(F) S1-Ferritin immunogen design. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 forms a hydrophobic collar around
the N-terminal Î²-sheet of S2 (residues 689-676). S1-ferritin immunogen design required
inclusion of this short stretch of S2 (colored cyan) attached by a linker. Terminal residues
of the structured portions of S1 and S2 are labeled.
(G) Schematic and 3D model of an S1âFerritin nanoparticle. A modeled nanoparticle
displaying RBD and NTD domains is depicted and colored according to the S1âferritin
schematic with truncation points and domain linkers indicated. See also Figure S1 and

Figure 4. Negative-Stain Electron Microscopy 3D Reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2
Spike Domain-Ferritin Nanoparticles
Modifications made to native sequence and linkers used for each construct are shown in
schematic diagrams.
(A) Negative-stain 3D reconstructions with applied octahedral symmetry are shown with
an asymmetric unit of non-ferritin density colored and the size of each particle indicated in
nanometers. Spike trimer density, is colored in red, and a model of a SpFN trimer based on
PDB 6VXX is shown docked into the negative-stain map and colored according to the
sequence diagram.
(B) Two non-ferritin densities per asymmetric unit were observed for RFN and are
highlighted in green. These densities putatively correspond to the receptor-binding domain
(RBD) but lack low resolution distinguishing features due to the small, globular shape of
these domains. The presence of two densities is likely due to flexibility in the linker and
heterogeneity in the RBD pose.
(C) Two layers of densities were distinguishable for pCoV146, with the putative N-terminal
domain (NTD) density of an asymmetric unit colored blue, proximal to the ferritin and two
smaller, more flexible densities corresponding to RBD distal to the ferritin and colored
green.
(D) An asymmetric unit of non-ferritin density for pCoV111 is colored in orange and a
monomer of S1 in the closed trimer state from PDB 6VXX is shown docked into the density
with domains colored as in the sequence diagram.

Materials and Methods
Immunogen Modeling and Design
Following release of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence on Jan 10th 2020, initial RBD-Ferritin and S1-Ferritin
immunogens were designed (Table S1). Subsequent iterative immunogen design and optimization utilized
atomic models of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD molecule (Joyce et al., 2020), or the SARS-2 S trimer structure
PDB ID: 6VXX, and PDB ID: 3BVE for the Helicobacter pylori Ferritin, and PDB ID: 4LQH for the
bullfrog linker sequence. Pymol (SchrÃ¶dinger) was used to generate the ferritin 24- subunit particle, and a
map created in UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) was supplied to cisTEM (Grant et al., 2018)
âalign_symmetryâ to align the ferritin particle to an octahedral symmetry convention. This was supplied to
âphenix.map_symmetryâ to generate a symmetry file and PDB file, for octahedral (for monomer-fusions)
and D4 (for trimer-fusions) symmetry. S-domain ferritin nanoparticle fusions were modelled using Pymol
and Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) and expanded using âphenix.apply_ncsâ (Liebschner et al., 2019). Visual
analysis and figure generation was conducted using ChimeraX and PyMOL.
RBD-Ferritin designs were generated by assessment of the hydrophobic surface of the SARS-CoV2 RBD surface and determining surface accessible mutations that reduced the hydrophobic surface. S1Ferritin designs were creating using the PDB ID: 6VXX and including a short region of the S2 domain,
which interacts with S1. Spike-Ferritin designs were created by modeling the coiled-coil region between S
residues 1140 and 1158 and increasing the coil-coil interaction either by mutagenesis, or by increasing the
length of the interaction region. RBD-NTD-Ferritin designs utilized RBD constructs with improved
properties in the context of RBD-Ferritin, which were fused to the N-terminus of NTD (12 - 303)-Ferritin
by a short 6 amino-acid linker.
DNA plasmid construction and preparation
SARS-CoV-2 S-domain ferritin constructs were derived from the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain genome sequence
(GenBank MN9089473), to include the following domains: RBD subunit (residues 331 - 527), NTD subunit
(residues 12 - 303), RBD subunit linked to NTD subunit (residues 331 - 527 linked to residues 12 - 303
with a short GSG linker), S1 domain (residues 12 - 696) and S ectodomain (residues 12 â 1158). Constructs
were modified to incorporate a N-terminal hexa-histadine tag (his) for purification of the RBD-Ferritin and
RBD-NTD-Ferritin constructs.
An S-2P construct was used as a template to generate the set of Spike ferritin nanoparticles.
Subsequent designs involving small deletions, additions and point mutations were generated using a
modified QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Agilent). RBD-ferritin and S1-ferritin constructs
were synthesized by GenScript. For some of the RBD-ferritin constructs, gene segments (gBlocks) were
synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies to encode various linker regions between RBD and ferritin.
Gene segments were stitched together with RBD- and ferritin-encoding PCR products using overlap
extension PCR and were re-subcloned into the CMVR vector. The His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD molecule
was generated by amplifying the RBD domain from the RBD-Ferritin plasmid while encoding the 3â
purification tag and subcloned into the CMVR vector. The NTD protein subunit was generated in a similar
manner, by amplifying the NTD domain from the S1-Ferritin construct. For expression of S, RBD, and
NTD proteins, the S protein domains were cloned into the CMVR expression plasmid using the
NotI/BamHI restriction sites. Constructs including the N-terminal region of the S protein included the native
leader sequence; for constructs not including this region we utilized a prolactin leader (PL) sequence
(Boyington et al., 2016).
Plasmid DNA generated by subcloning (restriction digest and ligation) was amplified in and
isolated from E. coli Top10 cells. The constructs resulting from site-directed mutagenesis were either
amplified in and isolated from E. coli Stbl3 or Top10 cells. Large-scale DNA isolation was performed using
either endo free Maxiprep, Megaprep or Gigaprep kits (Qiagen).
Immunogen expression and purification
All expression vectors were transiently transfected into Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
using ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were grown in

polycarbonate baffled shaker flasks at 34Â°C or 37Â°C and 8% CO2 at 120 rpm. Cells were harvested 5-6 days
post-transfection via centrifugation at 3,500 x g for 30 minutes. Culture supernatants were filtered with a
0.22-Âµm filter and stored at 4 oC prior to purification.
His-tagged proteins were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, while untagged proteins
were purified with GNA lectin affinity chromatography. Briefly, 25 mL GNA-lectin resin (VectorLabs)
was used to purify untagged protein from 1L of expression supernatant. GNA resin was equilibrated with
10 column volumes (CV) of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) followed by supernatant loading
twice at 4 oC. Unbound protein was removed by washing with 20 CV of PBS buffer. Bound protein was
eluted with 250mM methyl-Î± -D mannopyranoside in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). His-tagged proteins were
purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. 1 mL Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Scientific) was used to
purify protein from 1L of expression supernatant. Ni-NTA resin was equilibrated with 5 CV of phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) followed by supernatant loading 2x at 4 oC. Unbound protein was removed
by washing with 200 CV of PBS, followed by 50 CV 10mM imidazole in PBS. Bound protein was eluted
with 220mM imidazole in PBS. For all proteins, purification purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. RBDFerritin nanoparticle constructs had a propensity to form soluble or insoluble aggregates which affected the
ability to concentrate the samples. Addition of 1mM EDTA and 5% glycerol to the NiNTA purified
material, prior to SEC or other concentration steps, mitigated the aggregation issue, and increased the
nanoparticle formation as judged by SEC, and confirmed by neg-EM. All proteins were further purified by
size-exclusion chromatography using a 16/60 Superdex-200 purification column. Purification purity for all
the proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Removal of the His-tags for SARS2-CoV-2 S-2P and RBD for
use in ELISA were carried out using HRV-3C protease. Endotoxin levels for ferritin nanoparticle
immunogens were assessed (EndosafeÂ® nexgen-PTS, Charles River Laboratories) and 5 % v/v glycerol
was added prior to filter-sterilization with a 0.22-Âµm filter, flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, and storage at
-80 oC. Ferritin nanoparticle formation was assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) by determining the
hydrodynamic diameter at 25 Â°C using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK)
equipped with a 633-nm laser.
For the antibodies, plasmids encoding heavy and light chains of antibodies (CR3022, and SR1SR5) were co-transfected into Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturerâs instructions
for expression of antibodies. After 5 days, antibodies were purified from cleared culture supernatants with
Protein A agarose (ThermoFisher) using standard procedures, buffer was exchanged to PBS by dialysis,
and antibody concentration was quantified using calculated extinction coefficient and A280 measurements.
Negative-stain Electron Microscopy
Purified proteins were deposited at 0.02-0.08 mg/ml on carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 0.75%
uranyl formate. Grids were imaged using a FEI T20 operating at 200 kV with an Eagle 4K CCD using
SerialEM or using a Thermo Scientific Talos L120C operating at 120 kV with Thermo Scientific Ceta using
EPU. All image processing steps were done using RELION 3.0.8, RELION 3.1.1, and/or cisTEM-1.0.0beta. Particles were picked either manually or using templates generated from manually picked 2D class
averages. CTF estimation was done with CTFFIND 4.1.13 and used for 2D classification. 3D
reconstructions were generated using an initial reference generated from a corresponding synthetic atomic
model with a low pass filter of 80-100 angstroms to remove distinguishable features or from a similar
construct also low pass filtered to 80-100 angstroms. For all 3D reconstructions, O symmetry was enforced,
and no explicit mask was used. Visual analysis and figure generation was conducted using Chimera and
ChimeraX.
Dynamic Light Scattering
Spike-domain ferritin nanoparticle hydrodynamic diameter was determined at 25Â°C using a Malvern
Zetasizer Nano S (Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) equipped with a 633-nm laser. Samples were assessed
accounting for the viscosity of their respective buffers.

All biosensors were hydrated in PBS prior to use. All assay steps were performed at 30Â°C with agitation
set at 1,000 rpm in the Octet RED96 instrument (FortÃ©Bio). Biosensors were equilibrated in assay buffer
(PBS) for 15 seconds before loading of IgG antibodies (30 Âµg/ml diluted in PBS). SARS-COV-2 antibodies
were immobilized onto AHC biosensors (FortÃ©Bio) for 100 seconds, followed by a brief baseline in assay
buffer for 15 s. Immobilized antibodies were then dipped in various antigens for 100-200 s followed by
dissociation for 20-100 s.
Mouse sera binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, VoC RBDs, or SARS-CoV-1 RBD were carried out
as follows. HIS1K biosensors(FortÃ©Bio) were equilibrated in assay buffer for 15 s before loading of Histagged RBD (30 Î¼g/ml diluted in PBS) for 120 seconds. After briefly dipping in assay buffer (15 seconds
in PBS), the biosensors were dipped in mouse sera (100-fold dilution) for 180 seconds followed by
dissociation for 60 seconds.
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 RBD hACE2 inhibition assays were carried out as follows. SARSCoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 RBD (30 Î¼g/ml diluted in PBS) was immobilized on HIS1K biosensors (FortÃ©Bio)
for 180 seconds followed by baseline equilibration for 30 s. Serum was allowed to occur for 180 s followed
by baseline equilibration (30 s). ACE2 protein (30 Î¼g/ml) was the allowed to bind for 120 s. Percent
inhibition (PI) of RBD binding to ACE2 by serum was determined using the equation: PI = 100 â [(ACE2
binding in the presence of mouse serum)) â (mouse serum binding in the absence of competitor mAb)] Ã
100.
Mouse immunization
All research in this study involving animals was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act,
and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and
adhered to the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC Publication,
1996 edition. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
WRAIR. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice
were housed in the animal facility of WRAIR and cared for in accordance with local, state, federal, and
institutional policies in a National Institutes of Health American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility.
C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice (n=10/group) were immunized intramuscularly with 10 Âµg of
immunogen (unless stated) adjuvanted with either ALFQ or AlhydrogelÂ® in alternating caudal thigh
muscles three times, at 3-week intervals; blood was collected 2 weeks before the first immunization, the
day of the first immunization, and 2 weeks following each immunization, and at week 10 (Table S1). For
immunogen SpFN_1B-06-PL, mice were immunized with reduced doses of protein adjuvanted with ALFQ
with immunization schedule, site of injections, and timing of bleeds as described. Mice were randomly
assigned to experimental groups and were not pre-screened or selected based on size or other gross physical
characteristics. Serum was stored at 4Â°C or -80Â°C until analysis. Antibody responses were analyzed by
Octet Biolayer Interferometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), pseudovirus neutralization
assay, and live-virus neutralization assay.
Immunogen-Adjuvant preparation
Purified research grade nanoparticle immunogens were formulated in PBS with 5% glycerol at 1 mg/ml
and subsequently diluted with dPBS (Quality Biological) to provide 10 Î¼g or lower amount per 50 Î¼l dose
upon mixing with adjuvant. ALFQ (1.5X) liposomes, containing 600 Âµg/mL 3D-PHAD and 300 Î¼g ug/mL
QS-21, were gently mixed by slow speed vortex prior to use. Antigen was added to the ALFQ, vortexed at
a slow speed for 1 minute, mixed on a roller for 15 minutes, and stored at 4oC for 1 h prior to immunization.
Spike-Ferritin nanoparticle immunogens were formulated with ALFQ to contain 20 Î¼g 3D-PHAD and 10
Î¼g QS21 per 50 Î¼l dose. AlhydrogelÂ® stock (10 mg/ml aluminum (GMP grade; Brenntag)) was diluted to
900 Âµg/mL (1.5X) with DPBS and gently mixed. Appropriate volume and concentration of antigen was
added to the diluted AlhydrogelÂ® before being vortexed at low speed for 1 min, mixed on a roller for 15
minutes, and stored at 4oC for at least 1 h prior to immunization. Spike-Ferritin nanoparticle immunogens
were adsorbed to AlhydrogelÂ® aluminum hydroxide at 30 Î¼g aluminum per 50 Î¼l dose.

Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
96-well Immulon âUâ Bottom plates were coated with 1 Î¼g/mL of RBD or S protein (S-2P) antigen in PBS,
pH 7.4. Plates were incubated at 4Â°C overnight and blocked with blocking buffer (Dulbeccoâs PBS
containing 0.5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4, at room temperature (RT) for 2 h. Individual serum
samples were serially diluted 2-fold in blocking buffer and added to triplicate wells and the plates were
incubated for 1 hour (h) at RT. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG, gamma
chain specific (The Binding Site) was added and incubated at RT for an hour, followed by the addition of
2,2'-Azinobis [3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]-diammonium salt (ABTS) HRP substrate (KPL) for
1 h at RT. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% SDS per well and the absorbance (A) was
measured at 405 nm (A405) using an ELISA reader Spectramax (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) ) within
30 min of stopping the reaction.. Antibody positive (anti-RBD mouse mAb; BEI resources) and negative
controls were included on each plate. The results are expressed as end point titers, defined as the reciprocal
dilution that gives an absorbance value that equals twice the background value (antigen-coated wells that
did not contain the test sera, but had all other components added).
Mouse isotype ELISA were performed using a similar approach as above, but with the following
differences. Only Spike protein (S-2P) was used to coat the wells. The plates were blocked with PBS
containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), pH 7.4 for 30 minutes. The mouse serum samples were
serially diluted in duplicates either 3- or 4-fold in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, pH7.4.
The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse antibodies from Jackson
ImmunoResearch specific for either FcÎ³ subclass 1, FcÎ³ subclass 2a, or FcÎ³ subclass 2c. The secondary
antibodies were incubated for 30 minutes. TMB (3,3â,5,5â-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate (Thermo) was
added and the plates were incubated at RT for 5-10 minutes to allow color development. Stop solution
(Thermo) was added and the A405 was measured using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
A titration curve of serum concentration versus A450 was created. The titration curves were interpolated to
determine the dilution factor where A450=1.0 for each mouse sera sample and IgG subclass, and the
resulting values were used to calculate the IgG1/IgG2a ratio (for BALB/c mice) or IgG1/IgG2c ratio (for
C57BL/6 mice). In the animal groups immunized with SpFN_1B-06-PL with the adjuvant AlhydrogelÂ®,
many of the mouse IgG usage ratio could not be calculated due to insufficient signal for either IgG2a or
IgG2c in the mouse sera.
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 pseudovirus neutralization assay
The S expression plasmid sequences for SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan1, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351) and SARS-CoV
were codon optimized and modified to remove an 18 amino acid endoplasmic reticulum retention signal in
the cytoplasmic tail in the case of SARS-CoV-2, and a 28 amino acid deletion in the cytoplasmic tail in the
case of SARS-CoV. This allowed increased S incorporation into pseudovirions (PSV) and thereby enhance
infectivity. Virions pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein were used as a nonspecific control. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions (PSV) were produced by co-transfection of HEK293T/17
cells with a SARS-CoV-2 S plasmid (pcDNA3.4) and an HIV-1 NL4-3 luciferase reporter plasmid (The
reagent was obtained through the NIH HIV Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Human
Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) NL4-3 ÎEnv Vpr Luciferase Reporter Vector (pNL4-3.Luc.R-E-),
ARP-3418, contributed by Dr. Nathaniel Landau and Aaron Diamond). The SARS-CoV-2 S expression
plasmid sequence was derived from the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate Wuhan-Hu-1,
complete genome (GenBank accession MN908947), and the SARS-CoV-1 expression plasmid was derived
from the Urbani S sequence.

Infectivity and neutralization titers were determined using ACE2-expressing HEK293 target cells
(Integral Molecular) in a semi-automated assay format using robotic liquid handling (Biomek NXp
Beckman Coulter). Test sera were diluted 1:40 in growth medium and serially diluted, then 25 ÂµL/well was
added to a white 96-well plate. An equal volume of diluted SARS-CoV-2 PSV was added to each well and
plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C. Target cells were added to each well (40,000 cells/ well) and
plates were incubated for an additional 48 hours. RLUs were measured with the EnVision Multimode Plate
Reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using the Bright-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI). Neutralization doseâresponse curves were fitted by nonlinear regression with
a five-parameter curve fit using the LabKey ServerÂ® (Piehler et al., 2011), and the final titers are reported
as the reciprocal of the dilution of serum necessary to achieve 50% neutralization (ID50, 50% inhibitory
dilution) and 80% neutralization (ID80, 80% inhibitory dilution). Assay equivalency for SARS-CoV-2 was
established by participation in the SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing Assay Concordance Survey (SNACS) run by
the Virology Quality Assurance Program and External Quality Assurance Program Oversite Laboratory
(EQAPOL) at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, sponsored through programs supported by the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS.
SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus neutralization assay
The neutralization assay has been described in detail previously (Case et al., 2020). Briefly, SARS-CoV-2
strain 2019-nCoV/USA_WA1/2020 was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Virus was passaged once in Vero CCL81 cells (ATCC) and titrated by focus-forming assay on Vero E6
cells. Mouse sera were serially diluted and incubated with 100 focus-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 for 1
h at 37Â°C. Serum-virus mixtures were then added to Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 1 h
at 37Â°C. Cells were overlayed with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM. After 30 h, cells were fixed with
4% PFA in PBS for 20 minutes at room temperature then washed and stained overnight at 4Â°C with 1 Âµg/ml
of CR3022 (ter Meulen et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2020) in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1%
bovine serum albumin. Cells were subsequently stained with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG for 2 h
at room temperature. SARS-CoV-2-infected cell foci were visualized with TrueBlue peroxidase substrate
(KPL) and quantified using ImmunoSpotÂ® microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies, Shaker Heights, OH).
Neutralization curves were generated using Prism software (GraphPad Prism 8.0).

Protection experiments in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice
All research in this study involving animals was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act,
and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals and
adhered to the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NRC Publication,
1996 edition. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Trudeau Institure. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME). Mice were housed in the animal facility of the Trudeau Institute and cared for in accordance with
local, state, federal, and institutional policies in a National Institutes of Health American Association for
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility.
To determine an appropriate challenge viral stock amount and establish the K18-hACE2 SARSCoV-2 mouse challenge model, five viral doses were used to inoculate the K18-hACE2 mice. Each study
group was composed of 10 hACE2 K18 Tg mice (5 males and 5 females). Mice were infected on study day
0 doses ranging from 5 x 102 to 1 x 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 administered via intranasal
instillation. All mice were monitored for clinical symptoms and body weight twice daily, every 12 hours,
from study day 0 to study day 14. Mice were euthanized if they displayed any signs of pain or distress as
indicated by the failure to move after stimulated or inappetence, or if mice have greater than 25% weight
loss compared to their study day 0 body weight. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of lung sections following
infection with 1.25 x 104 PFU compared to control uninfected mouse lung sections are shown in Figure S6.

Figure 4. Negative-Stain Electron Microscopy 3D Reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 S-based ferritin nanoparticles
Modifications made to native sequence and linkers used for each construct are shown in schematic diagrams.
(A) Negative-stain 3D reconstructions with applied octahedral symmetry are shown with an asymmetric unit of non-ferritin density colored and the size of each
particle indicated in nanometers. Spike trimer density, is colored in red, and a model of a SARS-CoV-2 trimer based on PDB 6VXX is shown docked into the
negative-stain map and colored according to the sequence diagram.
(B) Two non-ferritin densities per asymmetric unit were observed for RFN and are highlighted in green. These densities putatively correspond to the receptorbinding domain (RBD) but lack low resolution distinguishing features due to the small, globular shape of these domains. The presence of two densities is
likely due to flexibility in the linker and heterogeneity in the RBD pose.
(C) Two layers of densities were distinguishable for pCoV146, with the putative N-terminal domain (NTD) density of an asymmetric unit colored blue, proximal
to the ferritin and two smaller, more flexible densities corresponding to RBD distal to the ferritin and colored green.
(D) An asymmetric unit of non-ferritin density for pCoV111 is colored in orange and a monomer of S1 in the closed trimer state from PDB 6VXX is shown
docked into the density with domains colored as in the sequence diagram.

Figure S5 SARS-CoV-2 SpFN vaccine candidate elicits robust binding and neutralizing antibody responses at reduced doses in mice.
Related to Figure 5 and 7.
(A) Biolayer interferometry analysis of C57BL/6 and (B) BALB/c mouse sera binding response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD following immunization with
reducing doses of SpFN.
(C, E) ELISA analysis of C57BL/6 and (D, F) BALB/c mouse sera binding response to SARS-CoV-2 RBD or S-2P following immunization with
reducing doses of SpFN.
(G) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus ID80 neutralization titers of mice immunized with 0.08 Î¼g SpFN + ALFQ.
(H) Authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus ID80 neutralization titers of mice immunized with 10 Î¼g (blue) or 0.08 Î¼g (light blue) SpFN + ALFQ. Geometric
mean titers for each group and time point are indicated by a horizontal line, n =10. Neutralization titers for the two dose groups at each study time
point were compared for statistically significant differences using a Mann-Whitney unpaired two-tailed non-parametric test. The two BALB/c time
points that showed differences are indicated by bars. P values <0.001 (***), <0.01 (**).
(I) Mouse sera from study week 10 was analyzed for hACE2 blocking capacity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (left) or SARS-CoV-1 RBD using a biolayer
interferometry assay format.
