ABSTRACT. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is especially severe in aged populations1.
Resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has been advanced by the recent development of SARSCoV-2 vaccines, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the recent emergence of SARSCoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility2. The emergence of these variants emphasizes the
need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially in aged populations.
Here, we describe the isolation of a new set of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use
them to test a novel therapeutic drug useful in infections of aged animals. Initially, we show that
many of the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (at positions 417, 484,
501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern (VOC)2. Their appearance
during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for their selection. Similar
to the human infection, aged mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 develop more
severe disease than young mice. In murine SARS, in which severity is also age-dependent, we
showed that elevated levels of an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and of a phospholipase,
PLA2G2D, contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice3,4. Using our virulent mouse-adapted
SARS-CoV-2, we show that infection of middle-aged mice lacking expression of DP1, a PGD2
receptor, or PLA2G2D are protected from severe disease. Further, treatment with a DP1
antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from a lethal infection. DP1 antagonism is one of the
first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, and
demonstrates that the PLA2G2D-PGD2/DP1 pathway is a useful target for therapeutic
interventions. (Words: 254)
TEXT
Isolation of mouse-adapted virus.
Mice are naturally resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2, resulting from incompatibility between
the viral surface (S) glycoprotein and mouse angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (mACE2)5. To
address this incompatibility, human ACE2 (hACE2) has been provided by genetic manipulation
of the mouse genome or exogenously using viral vectors. Transgenic expression of hACE26-9,
complete or partial replacement of mACE2 with hACE2 (hACE2-KI)10 or administration of viral
vectors expressing hACE2 all sensitize mice for infection11,12. Alternatively, the spike protein (S)
of SARS-CoV-2 has been altered using reverse genetics to enable binding to mACE213,14. SARSCoV-2 has been adapted to mice by targeting amino acids at positions 498/499 (Q498Y/P499T)
or 501 (N501Y). The resulting viruses can infect mice, although the resulting infection is very mild.
However, additional virus passage through mouse lungs results in increased virulence15. Mice
infected with virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory

syndrome-CoV) have been similarly developed and are very useful for studies of pathogenesis,
including in aged animals.
SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 show age-dependent increases in severity1. For example,
no patient under the age of 24 years succumbed to SARS-CoV during the 2002-2003 epidemic,
while 50% of those over 65 years died from the infection16. Parallel results were found in C57BL/6
(C57BL/6) mice infected with SARS. Young C57BL/6 mice were resistant to infection with mouseadapted SARS-CoV while mice became progressively more susceptible beginning at about 5
months of age4. Poor survival correlated with a suboptimal T cell response, which resulted from
delayed migration of respiratory dendritic cells (rDCs) to draining lymph nodes. We identified a
single prostaglandin (PG), PGD2, that increased in the lungs during aging and was responsible
for impaired DC migration4. We also showed that a single phospholipase A2, PLA2 group 2D
(PLA2G2D), increased in mouse respiratory DCs during aging and was responsible for increased
levels of PGD2, as well as other PGs in the aged mouse lung3. Given the similarities between
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in age-dependent increased disease severity, we
postulated that PGD2 and PLA2G2D would have similar roles in aged mice infected with a virulent
strain of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2.
To generate a virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we inserted the N501Y mutation into
the SARS-CoV-2 genome (rSARS2-N501YP0) using reverse genetics as previously described17.
As expected, this mutation rendered mice susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but BALB/c mice
lost only a minimal amount of weight even after administration of 105 PFU of virus. After 30
passages through mouse lungs, the virus became highly virulent such that 5000 PFU caused a
lethal disease in young BALB/c mice (Figure 1a). We sequenced viruses after 10, 20 and 30
passages. Virus from these passages became progressively more lethal (Figure 1a). Focusing
on changes in the S protein, passage 10 virus contained a Q498R mutation, which likely enhanced
binding to mACE213 (Figure 2a,b). By passage 20, a mutation at position 493 (Q493R) was
detected. By passage 30, mutations in residues 417 and 484 (K417M, E484K) also arose. E484K
does not appear to be required for mouse virulence since it was variably expressed by different
isolates that had equivalent lethality (Figure 2d).
In silico modeling of the interaction between mouse ACE2 and the spike glycoprotein
showed that Y501 in the spike allowed for pi-pi interactions and hydrophobic interactions to occur
with Y41 and H353 in mACE2, increasing the affinity and stability of the complex (Figure 2c,e).

Two additional spike mutations (Q498R and Q493R) further increased affinity and stability, mainly
driven by R493 which can create a salt bridge with D38 in mACE2 (previously a hydrogen bond
between Q493 in spike and D38 in mACE2). Mutations to other positively charged amino acids in
residue 493 of the spike have also been described in another mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-215
suggesting the importance of this salt bridge to D38 in mACE2. The contribution of R498 in the
spike is likely due to an increase in the buried solvent-accessible surface area of this residue
(from 80% to 99%), which improves the overall stability of the molecule and in turn could increase
the affinity for ACE2. Residues K417 and E484 in the spike do not interact directly with ACE2,
and have been reported to have minimal effects on hACE2 binding18. E484K and various
mutations in residue 417 have been associated with VOC B.1.351 (E484K + K417N) and P.1
(E484K + K417T). E484K and K417N have been shown to decrease antibody-mediated
neutralization19 and therefore have been hypothesized to emerge in humans as an evolutionary
advantage to evade immune responses. Here we show that E484K and mutations in K417 also
occur in the absence of an adaptive immune response, offering an alternative explanation for the
evolutionary pressures that drive the appearance of mutations in residues 417 and 484.
Previously published models of non-lethal murine SARS-CoV-2 have also reported mutations
identical to the ones described here after 30 mouse lung passages15,20,21 demonstrating the
advantage of this particular combination of mutations in driving murine lethality.
Mutations in three nonstructural proteins, nsp4, nsp8, and nsp9 were detected at passage
20. Regarding these, T295I in nsp4 and T67A in nsp9 have been described in other models of
SARS-CoV-2 mouse adaptation that caused moderate disease but were not lethal in young
BALB/c mice15, suggesting these mutations might be important in driving virulence but are
insufficient to cause death. T67A in nsp9 has also been described in a lethal mouse model of
SARS-CoV22, suggesting that this mutation might be important for mouse adaptation not only in
SARS-CoV-2 but in other coronaviruses as well. To assess the importance of Q493R and the nsp
mutations in virulence, we infected young BALB/c and middle-aged C57BL/6 mice with the
B.1.351 strain, which contains K417N, E484K, and N501Y. Infection with a high dose of virus (105
PFU) resulted in modest weight loss and 20% lethality, indicating that one or more of the
mutations detected in nsp4, nsp 8, nsp9 and Q493R were required for mouse virulence (Figure
2f).
Virus was then plaque purified three times and individual plaques were sequenced. One
plaque was chosen for further study and propagated (SARS2-N501YMA30). Of note, SARS2-

N501YMA30 grew less well than rSARS2-N501YP0 in human airway epithelial (Calu-3) cells,
showing that increased virulence in mice did not result in increased replication in human cells
(Extended Data Figure 1a).
Clinical and pathological characterization of mouse adapted viruses.
To further assess the virulence of SARS2-N501YMA30, we infected 6-10 week old BALB/c and
C57BL/6, and 6-9 month old C57BL/6 mice intranasally with 5000 PFU (Figure 1b). 5000 PFU
SARS2-N501YMA30 caused a lethal infection in young BALB/c mice and middle-aged C57BL/6
mice but only modest weight loss in young C57BL/6 mice. For most of our subsequent
experiments, we infected young BALB/c or middle-aged C57BL/6 mice with SARS2-N501YMA30.
After infection of young BALB/c mice with 5000 PFU, viral genomic RNA was detected in most
organs at all time points, although levels were much higher in the lungs (Figure 1c). Infectious
virus was detected in most organs at day 2 but by 4 and 6 days post infection (dpi), it was detected
only in the lungs, and to a lesser extent, the heart (Figure 1d). Consistent with the presence of
virus in organs, we also detected virus in the blood of 4/5 mice at 2 dpi (Figure 1d, right). To
extend these results, we analyzed histological samples for evidence of pathological changes and
virus antigen (Figure 1e-h). We detected pathological changes in the lungs and nasal cavity at
all times, but not in other organs (Figure 1e,f, Extended Data Figure 2). Pathological findings in
the lung included perivascular, peribronchial and interstitial infiltration and alveolar edema. We
also detected occasional pulmonary vascular thrombi, which are prominent findings in patients
with severe COVID-1923 and rare multinuclear syncytia (Figure 1e, insets, lower panels). In the
sinonasal cavity, we detected evidence of infection of the olfactory and respiratory epithelium,
with prominent infection of sustentacular cells (Extended Data Figure 1b,c). Unlike SARS-CoV2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice9, there was no pathological or immunohistochemical evidence of
infection in the brain (Extended Data Figure 1d,e).
Immunological response to SARS2-N501YMA30 infection
To further characterize the immunological response in the lungs to SARS2-N501YMA30 infection,
we measured levels of several cytokines, chemokines and inflammation-associated molecules in
BALB/c lungs at days 2, 4, and 6 p.i. Mice were infected with 1000 PFU in these assays to ensure
that most survived until 6 dpi. Increases in IFNs (IFNa, IFNb, IFNg, IFNl), ISGs (ISG15, OAS1),
cytokines (IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15), chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL2, CXCL9,
CXCL10) and CCR7, a chemokine receptor required for cell migration to draining lymph nodes,
were observed over the course of the infection, with peak levels of IFNa, IFNb, and IFNl

prominent at 2 dpi. (Extended Data Figure 3a). Notably, levels of most of these pro-inflammatory
molecules remained elevated throughout the infection, as also occurs in the blood of COVID-19
patients24. To determine the character of the cells infiltrating the lungs observed on pathological
examination, we immunophenotyped the infiltrating cells at 4 and 6 dpi. (Extended Data Figure
3b,e). Over time, there was a gradual increase in the numbers of infiltrating CD11b+ cells
(macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils) (Extended Data Figure 3b). Virus-specific CD4 and
CD8 T cells were also detected in the lungs at day 6 p.i. These cells expressed IFNg and TNF in
response to stimulation with pools of peptides covering the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins
(spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid) (Extended Data Figure 3c,d). The S, N, and M proteins
all elicited CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, with the S protein responsible for the largest responses
in both cell types. Lymphopenia is a hallmark of severe COVID-1925 and was detected in SARS2N501YMA30-infected middle-aged mice (Extended Data Figure 4).
Role of PGD2/DP1 signaling and PLA2G2D expression in disease severity infected mice.
Since we previously identified roles for PGD2/DP1 signaling and PLA2G2D expression by
respiratory DCs in enhanced disease in SARS-CoV-infected middle-aged mice3,4, we next
infected 8-12 month old PLA2G2D-/- and PTGDR-/- (lacking DP1 expression) mice with 5000 PFU,
a lethal dose of SARS2-N501YMA30. Lethality was completely or partially abrogated in the absence
of PLA2G2D or DP1 expression, respectively (Figure 3a). In both cases, the kinetics of virus
clearance was enhanced, likely contributing to diminished disease (Figure 3b). Further, many of
the pathological changes observed in the lungs of infected middle-aged C57BL/6 mice, such as
extensive inflammatory infiltration and edema, were not present in either PLA2G2D-/- and PTGDR/-

mice (Figure 3c,d). Together, these results show that PLA2G2D, associated with anti-

inflammatory effects in mice infected with SARS-CoV, also contributes to poor outcomes in
SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. The results also demonstrate that these protective effects were at
least partially mediated through the PGD2/DP1 axis.
Antagonizing PGD2/DP1 signaling with asapiprant.
While several drugs with inhibitory activity against PLA2 molecules have been described26, none
are specific for murine PLA2G2D. However, asapiprant (BGE-175) ([2-(Oxazol-2-yl)-5-(4-{4[(propan-2-yl)oxy]phenylsulfonyl} piperazine-1-yl)phenoxy] acetic acid), a potent and specific
antagonist of human PGD2/DP1 signaling, has been previously described (Figure 3e)27.
Asapiprant is a potent and selective antagonist of PGD2-signaling via the DP1 receptor with a
mean Ki of 0.44 nM. Asapiprant affinity for DP1 was 300 to >15000-fold higher than for any other

prostanoid receptor tested27. We administered asapiprant to mice by once daily oral gavage (30
mg/kg), starting two days after infection with 5000 PFU of SARS2-N501YMA30 and for 6 days
thereafter (Figure 3f). For these experiments, we used middle-aged C57BL/6 mice. We chose to
start treatment at two days after infection because it is relevant for possible use in symptomatic
patients. In middle-aged mice infected with a lethal dose of SARS2-N501YMA30, asapirant reduced
mortality from 100% to <10%, with concomitant effects on weight loss (Figure 3g). As expected
based on the studies of PLA2G2D-/- and PTGDR-/- mice described above, drug treatment resulted
in faster kinetics of virus clearance (Figure 3h) and diminished pathological changes in the lungs
(Figure 3i,j). In contrast, treatment with the drug did not reduce the weight loss observed in young
SARS2-N501YMA30-infected C57BL/6 mice (Figure 3k).
Discussion
We describe a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, isolated from mouse lungs after 30 serial passages.
Unlike previously described mouse-adapted viruses, this strain is highly virulent in young and old
mice, and infects only the lungs and not the brain. Further, it contains a set of mutations that are
also observed in the B.1.351 and P.1 strains (K417N/T, E484K and N501Y) although K417N/T is
replaced by K417M in SARS2-N501YMA30. All three amino acids are located in the receptor
binding domain and E484 and N501 are hotspots for recognition by neutralizing antibodies19.
N501Y enhances binding to ACE2 and transmission in hamsters28, while K417N and E484K do
not appear to enhance binding to ACE218. Our results show that the selection of K417M (and by
extension, presumably K417N) and E484K does not result solely from evasion of the antibody
response since they arose in mice in the absence of any immune pressure. Infection of mice with
B1.351 resulted in mild disease, indicating that changes outside of the S protein were critical for
mouse virulence. T295I, located in the transmembrane domain of nsp4 and Q493K in the receptor
binding domain of S were identified in another variant of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-215 so that
mutations at these sites are prime candidates for conferring virulence in mice.
Our results identify a key role for PGD2/DP1 signaling in enhanced COVID-19 disease severity
during aging and show that delivery of a DP1 inhibitor at 2 dpi, a time comparable to when drug
might be used in patients, converted a lethal to a sublethal infection. Asapiprant has been used
in previous studies of allergic rhinitis and asthma. In a rat model of asthma, oral asapiprant
reduced inflammatory cell numbers in BAL fluid and reduced the increase in airway
hyperresponsiveness (AHR)27. Asapiprant has been evaluated in 18 clinical studies (Phase 1, 2,
3) (2000 patients and 200 healthy volunteers) conducted in the US, UK, France, and Japan for

the treatment of allergic rhinitis, alone or in combination with cetirizine, an anti-histamine29. Oncedaily dosing of asapiprant for up to 4 weeks was considered safe and well tolerated. Decreased
airway resistance after PGD2 challenge and decreased rhinitis symptom scores after allergen
exposure were demonstrated in these studies, consistent with on-target pharmacodynamics29.

COVID-19 and also identify PGD2/DP1 signaling and PLA2G2D as useful targets for therapy in
aged individuals.

METHODS
Generation of SARS-CoV-2 encoding N501Y mutation in the S Protein
p-BAC SARS-CoV-2 carrying the sequence of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (WT-SARS-CoV-2 BAC) was
a gift from Drs. Sonja Zuniga and Luis Enjuanes (CNB-CSIC, Madrid, Spain). The only difference
between the Wuhan-Hu-1 and 2019n-CoV/USA-WA1/2019 strains is one amino acid change in
ORF8 and 2 silent mutations (in ORF1a and ORF1b). Two silent mutations were introduced into
the BAC clone to enable differentiate from wild type SARS-CoV-2 (A20085G and G26840C). pBAC SARS-CoV-2 with a N501Y mutation in the spike (N501Y-SARS-CoV-2 BAC) was generated
using a lambda red recombination system with I-SceI homing endonuclease as previously
described17. In brief, forward and reverse primers with overlapping SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence
with the N501Y mutation followed by sequence complementary to the target plasmid (pEP-KanS)
were synthesized (Invitrogen). A PCR fragment with overlapping ends carrying SARS-CoV-2
sequence flanking the Kanamycin resistance marker was amplified with the primers described
using pEP-KanS as template. The PCR fragment was purified using gel purification kit
(Invitrogen). Purified PCR fragment was electroporated into GS1783 strains of E. coli carrying pBAC SARS-CoV-2. Successful recombinants were selected with kanamycin resistance. The
kanamycin marker was removed by arabinose induction of I-SceI cleavage followed by
homologous recombination of the overlapping ends. Successful recombinants were selected by
replica plating for the loss of kanamycin resistance. Recombinants were purified and sequenced
to confirm the introduction of N501Y mutation into the BAC clone. The primer sequences used
were; Forward: 5’-ACCTTGTAATGGTGTTGAAGGTTTTAATTGTTACTTTCCTTTACAATCATAT
GGTTTCCAACCCACTTATGGTGTTGGTTAGGATGACGACGATAAGTAG-3’.
Reverse: 5’- CATGTAGAAGTTCAAAAGAAAGTACTACTACTCTGTATGGTTGGTAACCAA CA
CCATTAGTGGGTTGGAAACCATCAACCAATTAACCAATTCTGATTAG-3’. N501Y mutations
are italicized and underlined; sequences complementary to pEP-KanS are bolded. 2 μg of N501YSARS-CoV-2 BAC were transfected into Vero E6 (ATCC) with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) in
a 6-well plate according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were monitored daily for cytopathic
effects (CPE). Cultures were harvested when CPE was >50% by freezing at -80°C. rSARS2-

N501YP0 was further passaged in Calu-3 cells in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. Virus titer
was determined by plaque assay.
Mice, cells and virus.
6-to-10-week- or 6-month-old BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories. 2019n-CoV/USA-WA1/2019 (Accession number: MN985325.1) and 20H/501Y.V2
(B.1.351, BEI catalogue number NR-54009) were obtained from BEI and passaged in Calu-3 2B4
cells30. Calu-3 2B4 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20% FBS. Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). All viruses were sequenced after
propagation and found to match the input strain.
Serial in vivo passaging of virus in mice
Serial blind passage of rSARS2-N501YP0 through mouse lungs was performed in 8-to-10-weekold BALB/c mice. In brief, two mice were each inoculated with 50 μl of the virus intranasally at
each passage. At 2/3 dpi, mice were sacrificed, and lungs were pooled, homogenized in PBS and
used to infect naïve mice. After 30 passages, virus was obtained and plaque purified three times
using Vero E6 cells. Several isolates were obtained and a single one was chosen for further study
(SARS2-N501YMA30). SARS2-N501YMA30 was further propagated in Calu-3 2B4 cells.
Mouse infection
Mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and infected intranasally with the indicated
amount of virus in a total volume of 50 μl of DMEM. Animal weight and health were monitored
daily. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) Laboratory
at the University of Iowa. All animal studies were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care
and Use Committee and meet stipulations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Virus titer by plaque assay.
At the indicated times, mice were euthanized and transcardially perfused with PBS. Organs were
harvested and homogenized prior to clarification by centrifugation and titering. Virus or tissue
homogenate supernatants were serially diluted in DMEM. 12 well plates of VeroE6 cells were
inoculated at 37oC in 5% CO2 for 1 h and gently rocked every 15 min. After removing the inocula,
plates were overlaid with 0.6% agarose containing 2% FBS. After 3 days, overlays were removed,

and plaques visualized by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. Viral titers were quantified as PFU/mL
tissue.
Collection of whole blood/serum
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine. Blood was collected
through retro-orbital bleed with a capillary tube (Fisher Scientific). Blood was allowed to clot at
room temperature for 30 minutes. Serum was clarified by centrifugation and transferred to a new
tube for storage at -80°C. For collection of whole blood, heparinized capillary tubes were used
(Fisher Scientific).
Histology and Immunohistochemistry.
Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine and perfused
transcardially with PBS. Tissues were fixed in zinc formalin. For routine histology, tissue sections
(~4 µm each) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissues were evaluated for the presence
of edema or hyaline membranes (0-4) using distribution-based ordinal scoring: 0 – none; 1 <25%; 2 - 26-50%; 3 - 51-75% and >75% of tissue fields. Perivascular lymphoid inflammation was
evaluated by severity-based ordinal scoring: 0 – absent; 1- minor, solitary to loose infiltration of
cells; 2 – moderate, small to medium aggregates; and 3 – severe, robust aggregates that are
circumferential around vessels and can extend into adjacent parenchyma. Interstitial scores were
evaluated using a modified H-Score for the presence of interstitial disease: 0 – none; 1 – minor,
increased cellularity in septa; 2-moderate, cellular infiltrates with some thickened septa and
uncommon inflammatory cells extending into lumen; and 3 – severe, cellular infiltrates in
thickened septa and filling in air space lumens with atelectasis and / or evidence of diffuse alveolar
damage (edema or hyaline membranes). For each score, this was multiplied by the % of lung
affected, then summed for each lung and divided by 100 to yield a final score of 0-3. For SARSCoV-2 antigen detection, slides were incubated with blocking reagent (10% normal goat serum x
30 minutes) followed by rabbit monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 N protein (1:20,000
dilution x 60 minutes, #40143-R019, Sino Biological US Inc., Wayne, PA, USA), then incubated
with Rabbit Envision (Dako) and diaminobenzidine (Dako) as chromogen. Lung tissues sections
were evaluated by a boarded veterinary pathologist familiar with the model using the postexamination method of masking31. IHC was ordinally scored on the % distribution of staining in
the tissues: 0 – absent, 1 – 0-25%; 2 – 26-50%; 3 – 51-75%, and 4 - >75% of tissue.

Animals were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and perfused transcardially with 10 mL PBS.
Lungs were removed, minced, and digested in HBSS buffer consisting of 2% fetal calf serum, 25
mM HEPES, 1 mg/mL collagenase D (Roche) and 0.1 mg/mL DNase (Roche) at 37°C for 30
minutes. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by passage through a 70 μm cell strainer. Cells
were enumerated with a Scepter 2.0 cell counter (MilliporeSigma). Whole blood was treated with
ACK lysis buffer for 1 minute. Cells were washed and pelleted. Cells were then washed and
blocked with 1 μg α-CD16/α-CD32 (2.4G2) antibody at 4 °C for 20 minutes and surface stained
with the following antibodies at 4°C for 30 minutes: V450 α-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11; Cat. No.:

No.: 139304) Cells were washed, fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD
Biosciences).
For intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), lymphocytes were cultured in 96-well dishes at
37°C for 5-6 h in the presence of 2 μM peptide pool and brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). Cells were
then labeled for cell-surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD
Biosciences), and labeled with α-IFN-g and α-TNF antibody. All flow cytometry data were acquired
using a BD FACSVerse and analyzed with FlowJo software.
RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) or a Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit
(Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following DNase treatment, 200 ng
of total RNA was used as a template for first strand cDNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). The resulting cDNA was subjected to amplification of
selected genes by real-time quantitative PCR using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Average values from duplicates of each gene were used to calculate the relative
abundance of transcripts normalized to HPRT and presented as 2-ΔCT. The primers used for
cytokine and chemokines were previously reported32. For detection of viral genomes, the following
primers were used to amplify the genomic RNA for the N protein: 2019-nCoV_N1-F: 5’-GAC CCC
AAA ATC AGC GAA AT-3’; 2019-nCoV_N1-R: 5’-TCT GGT TAC TGC CAG TTG AAT CTG-3’.

Viral whole genome sequencing
Samples were treated with TRIzol reagent for viral inactivation and RNA extraction. Sequencing
libraries were prepared using the sequencing protocol (v2) and primer pools (v3) from the ARTIC
network (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bdp7i5rn). Reads were sequenced on a MinION
sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies and consensus sequences were generated using
Medaka

protocol

v1.1.0

(https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html). 249,944 average reads +/82,509 (standard deviation) were obtained per sample. After quality filtering and alignment,
average sequencing depth was >200X per amplicon for each sample. The consensus sequence
of P10 and P20 virus from mouse lung homogenates contained areas with low sequencing depth;
in order to accurately cover these gaps, we amplified the missing regions using individual PCR
reactions and performed Sanger sequencing on the amplicons.
In silico structural modelling and analysis
A homology model for mouse ACE2 (NP_001123985.1) was generated using YASARA and
docked into the crystal structure of complexed human ACE2 and spike RBD (PDB: 6M0J).
Mutation calculations were performed on the mACE2-Spike complex in Bioluminate (Schrodinger
Release 2020-4) by first using the Protein Preparation Wizard and then the Residue Scanning
module. Stability and affinity calculations were performed optimizing for the affinity and backbone
minimization was used with a cutoff of 5 Å. Figures were generated in PyMOL. Software used
was installed and configured by SBGrid33.
Treatment with asapiprant. For asapiprant treatment, 7-8 month old, male and female C57BL/6
mice were infected with SARS2-N501YMA30 (5000 PFU). Mice were treated daily from days 2-8
after infection with 0.2 ml vehicle (0.5% Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium (Na-CMC), Sigma), or
30 mg/kg asapiprant (BioAge) diluted in 0.2 ml vehicle. Drug was administered via oral gavage.
Statistical analysis
Differences in mean values between groups were analysed by ANOVA and Student’s t-tests and
differences in survival were analysed by log-rank (Mantel–Cox) tests using GraphPad Prism 8.
All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean and were corrected for multiple
comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.005,
