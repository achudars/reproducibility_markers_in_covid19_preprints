Abstract
Background and Aims: The host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), is highly expressed in small intestine. Our aim was to study colonic ACE2 expression in
Crohn's disease (CD) and non-inflammatory bowel disease (non-IBD) controls. We
hypothesized that the colonic expression levels of ACE2 impacts CD course. Methods: We
examined the expression of colon ACE2 using RNA-seq and quantitative (q) RT-PCR from 69
adult CD and 14 NIBD control patients. In a subset of this cohort we validated ACE2 protein
expression and localization in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded matched colon and ileal tissues
using immunohistochemistry. The impact of increased ACE2 expression in CD for the risk of
surgery was evaluated by a multivariate regression analysis and a Kaplan-Meier estimator. To
provide critical support for the generality of our findings, we analyzed previously published RNAseq data from two large independent cohorts of CD patients. Results: Colonic ACE2 expression
was significantly higher in a subset of adult CD patients (ACE2-high CD). IHC in a sampling of
ACE2-high CD patients confirmed high ACE2 protein expression in the colon and ileum
compared to ACE2-low CD and NIBD patients. Notably, we found that ACE2-high CD patients
are significantly more likely to undergo surgery within 5 years of diagnosis, with a Cox
regression analysis finding that high ACE2 levels is an independent risk factor (OR 2.18;
95%CI, 1.05-4.55; p=0.037). Conclusion: Increased intestinal expression of ACE2 is
associated with deteriorated clinical outcomes in CD patients. These data point to the need for
molecular stratification that may impact CD disease-related outcomes.

Introduction
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestinal tract affecting
millions of people worldwide

1-3

.

CD patients frequently require immunosuppressant

medications, which can increase the risk of infection, including for respiratory diseases such as
influenza

and

pneumonia.

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu).

COVID-19

infections

are

increasing

world-wide

A significant number of patients present with gastrointestinal

symptoms and high levels of viral RNA in the stool have been detected. This has led the IBD
research community to investigate molecules associated with SARS-CoV2 infectivity with an
emphasis on its cognate receptor ACE2. ACE2 is essential for viral entry into epithelial cells and
is abundantly expressed in the lung and intestinal epithelium, with markedly higher expression
in the small intestine under normal conditions. Expression of two mucosa-specific serine
proteases, TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, also promote SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into host cells. In
the small intestine, levels of expression of ACE2 in patients with CD are dependent on
inflammation status and the specific anatomical location4.
Disease presentation and progression within CD is highly heterogeneous in location,
severity of inflammation, and other phenotypes. Current CD clinical classifications fail to
accurately predict disease-related outcomes. Defining on a molecular basis subsets of IBD
patients with similar severity is essential for developing guidelines for the use of standard IBD
therapies. Recently, Suárez-Fariñas et al. showed high small bowel enterocyte brush border
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. IBD medications, both biologic and non-biologic, did not
significantly impact the expression of both genes in the uninflamed small intestine5. However,
Potdar et al. revealed that within CD, small bowel ACE2 was reduced in patients subsequently
developing complicated disease and that its expression was restored in responders to biologic

therapy6. However, there remain three major gaps in our knowledge not addressed by recent
studies reporting on ACE2 expression and its association with clinical IBD. First, the role of
colonic ACE2 in predicting disease course in CD remains unstudied. Second, how the
expression of ACE2 relates to that of other genes, as determined by unbiased transcriptomics,
needs to be elucidated. Finally, the relationship of colonic and ileal ACE2 expression in the
same patient and its association to disease outcome is unknown.
In this current study, we show that expression of ACE2, as well as TMPRSS2 and
TMPRSS4, are highly variable in the intestines of adult and pediatric patients with CD, and that
their expression levels associate longitudinally with IBD outcome. Our work reveals a novel
connection between colonic ACE2 expression and CD-associated clinical outcomes. These
findings motivate future studies that focus on differences in ACE2 regulation between ileum and
colon in Crohn’s disease and also on whether colonic epithelial SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is
greater in the ACE2-high subtype of patients.

Materials and Methods

Subjects, Samples, and Clinical Information

Colonic mucosa was obtained from surgically resected colon specimens from patients with an
established diagnosis of CD between February 2012 and Jan 2018. All samples were collected
from disease-unaffected regions without macroscopic inflammation and were from ascending
colon. Clinical information was collected from medical records up to 5 years after CD diagnosis.
Two Independent cohorts of adult CD and treatment-naïve pediatric CD samples were
downloaded from GEO (accession numbers GSE57945 and GSE137344). Pediatric CD
samples from GSE57945 were processed as described previously 12.

RNA isolation, sequencing, and processing
Adult samples from UNC hospitals were isolated and sequenced as previously described 8.
Briefly, RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol, and RNA purity was assessed with Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000. RNA-seq
libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq polyA+ Sample Prep Kit. Paired-end (50 bp)
sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 and 4000 platforms.
Cutadapt v2.9 (https://doi.org/10.14806/ej.17.1.200) was used to remove sequencing
adapters and filter low quality reads (-q 10). Quantification of sequencing reads was performed
using Salmon v1.2.

sratoolkit v2.10.1 (http://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/). The remaining data underlying this article are
available in the article and in its online supplementary material.

RNA analysis
Raw sequencing counts from Salmon were DESeq2 normalized and VST transformed10. Box
plots were generated using ggplot2, and PCA was performed using the prcomp function in R
v3.6.0.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Human ileum and colon tissue biopsies from NIBD, colon-like Crohn’s disease (CL) and ileumlike Crohn’s disease (IL) were fixed in 10% (vol/vol) neutral buffered formalin, embedded in
paraffin, and prepared as histological sections. After deparaffinization and epitope retrieval in 1X
citrate buffer solution, sections were blocked for 1 h in 3% BSA before immunostaining was
performed. Polyclonal goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems #AF933) was applied overnight
at 4oC, followed by a 1 h incubation with a secondary anti-goat (Alexa Fluor 594) antibody the
next day. Slides were then incubated with DAPI (Invitrogen #D1306) for 5 min to stain nuclei
and mounted using FluorSave Reagent (EMD Millipore #345789). Fluorescence was detected
using an Olympus VS120 virtual slide microscope.

ACE2 Signal Intensity

ACE2 fluorescent signal intensity was measured using ImageJ software and normalized to
background. To facilitate measurements, images of the stained tissue sections were converted
to black and white images on the ACE2 channel, removing signal from DAPI. For each section,

pixel intensity was measured in three different regions that were selected for optimal histological
cut, showing intact villi (ileum) or colonocytes (colon). Five intensity measurements (e.g., yellow
rectangles on supplemental data images) were analyzed per region (Supplemental Figure 1).
N=4 patients per group. Intensity measurements were averaged per patient and normalized to
disease-control group. Significance was determined via one-way ANOVA with multiple
comparisons.

Reverse-Transcriptase qPCR Analysis

Total RNA was extracted from dissected colonic mucosa stored in RNAlater using TRIzol
reagent and purified with the Total RNA Purification Plus Kit (48300; Norgen Biotek) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was extracted from isolated and cultured colonic
IECs using the Single Cell RNA Purification Kit (51800; Norgen Biotek). Complementary DNA
for mRNA was generated from 500 ng of RNA using the High-Capacity Complementary DNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (4368814; Thermo Fisher Science). Comparative-Ct-TaqMan with a
relative quantification qPCR for mRNAs was performed on the QuantStudio 3 RT-PCR system
using TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (4444557; Thermo Fisher Science) with individual
TaqMan probes (TaqMan Gene Expression assays, assay ID: Hs01085333_m1 [ACE2],
Hs02339424_g1 [RPS9]). Expression of ACE2 was normalized to RPS9.

Statistical Analysis

All numeric data in the figures are expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). Differences
between the 2 groups were analyzed by a Mann–Whitney or Fisher exact test. Differences
between the 3 groups were analyzed by a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple

Results

ACE2 stratifies two different molecular subtypes of Crohn’s disease
The clinical presentation and course of CD is highly variable. Previously, we found that gene
expression data from non-inflamed colon tissue from adult CD (N=28) and non-IBD (NIBD)
patients (N=14) clearly segregate CD patients into two disease subtypes 8. CD patients in one
class largely maintained gene expression profiles of the normal colon (colon-like; CL), whereas
in colons of patients in the other class, several normally ileum-specific genes showed robust
expression (ileum-like; IL). Altered chromatin accessibility

and microRNA expression

across these classes indicated substantive gene regulatory changes, reflecting a fundamental
shift in underlying molecular phenotypes. Interestingly, ACE2, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4
expression were not significantly different between adult CD and non-IBD (NIBD) patients when
considering all CD patients. However, ACE2 was elevated and TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 were
decreased significantly in IL CD patients relative to CL CD patients (Figure. 1). In particular,
RNA-seq data showed ACE2 mRNA levels were 22-fold higher in IL vs CL. Therefore, for the
purpose of this paper, we will refer to the two molecular subtypes here as ACE2-high (IL) and
ACE2-low (CL).
Steady state mRNA expression does not necessarily correspond to protein levels, and
transcriptomic assays in bulk tissue lack information on tissue localization. To define the
expression and localization of ACE2 in CD at high resolution in intact tissue samples, we
performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on matched formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
uninflamed colon and ileum tissue from 8 CD and 4 NIBD patients. When divided into CD

subclasses based on colonic ACE2 mRNA expression, ACE2-high CD patients exhibited
significantly more ACE2 protein signal compared to NIBD and ACE2-low CD patients (Figure
2). Furthermore, abundant immunoreactivity was displayed in villus enterocytes of ileal tissue
with a noted significant difference in ACE2 protein between NIBD and ACE2-high CD patients
(Figure 2). Therefore, we can establish that ACE2 protein levels are strongly correlated with
ACE2 mRNA expression in non-inflamed tissue in our patient cohort, in both the colon and
ileum.

RNA-seq analysis reveals ACE2-high and ACE2-low subclasses in treatment-naïve pediatric
Crohn’s disease patients
ACE2 expression profiles in adult CD patients may vary due to patient treatment histories.
Therefore, we sought to determine whether treatment-naïve pediatric CD patients also
segregated into similar molecular classes. We performed a principal component analysis (PCA)
using our expression data from adult colon samples combined with previously published
pediatric expression data from ileal biopsies in age-matched pediatric CD (n=201) and NIBD
(n=40) patients generated within the Pediatric Risk Stratification Study (RISK)

12

(Figure 3A)

and analyzed the RISK samples for ACE2 expression levels. Unsurprisingly, samples
predominantly separated by study (first principal component). However, two molecular
subclasses were evident along the second principal component, similar to the first principal
component in single cohort PCAs . Further, ACE2 expression was highly correlated with the
second principal component in the pediatric CD samples (Figure 3B), aligning well with the
ACE2-high and ACE2-low subclasses defined by our adult CD colon expression data.
Additionally, we performed a combined PCA using our adult samples with expression
data from a second previously published study of adult and pediatric ileal biopsies from NIBD (n
= 25, no intestinal inflammation and normal histology) and CD (n = 93) patients

13

(Figure 3C).

Again, we observed evidence of ACE2-high and ACE2-low subtypes of CD in this independent
cohort of patients (Figure 3D).

Adult colonic and pediatric ileal ACE2 levels correlate with poor clinical outcomes in Crohn’s
disease patients
To determine the clinical impact of colonic ACE2 expression in CD patients, we
compared outcomes between 14 ACE2-high and 14 ACE2-low CD patients from the original
RNA-seq dataset (Figure 1). At the time of CD diagnosis, the only significant difference in
clinical characteristics between the subgroups was a higher proportion with ileal involvement in
ACE2-high CD patients (92.9 vs. 50.0%, p=0.03; Supplementary Table 1). We note that the
time to first surgery (bowel resection) within 5 years after CD diagnosis was substantially (but
not quite significantly) higher in ACE2-high CD patients (78.6 vs. 42.9%, p=0.12). To better
understand this potential relationship to surgery, we generated a Kaplan-Meier plot and
performed a subsequent log-rank analysis that showed there was a near-significant difference in
time to surgery between the CD subgroups (p=0.095; Supplementary Figure 2). To further
elucidate the impact of colonic ACE2 expression on time to first surgery after CD diagnosis, we
next performed Cox regression analysis to account for other variables. Covariates shown in
Table 1 and use of anti-TNF alpha agents within 5 years after CD diagnosis were balanced by
propensity score for this analysis11. Again, we observed a higher risk of surgery in ACE2-high
CD patients (OR 3.11; 95%CI, 0.92-10.50; p=0.067; Supplementary Table 2).
To account for a potential Type 1 error due to the small number of samples in the Cox
analysis, we analyzed an independent cohort of adult CD patients. Colonic ACE2 expression
was determined in 39 adult CD patients by qPCR. We also performed qPCR on 15 of the 28 CD
samples and the 8 of the 14 NIBD from the original cohort (Figure 1) to help stratify samples
based on ACE2 levels using qPCR. From this unknown cohort, we determined 4 additional
patients to be ACE2-high CD patients and 35 ACE2-low CD patients (Figure 4A). After

combining with our original dataset for a total of 49 ACE2-low and 18 ACE2-high CD patients,
we found that the difference in ileal involvement between the two CD subgroups was no longer
significant (Table 1). However, notably, we did find that ACE2-high CD patients show a
significantly higher rate of surgery within 5 years after CD diagnosis than ACE2-low patients
(77.8 vs. 44.9 %, p=0.03). Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference
in the time to first surgery between the two CD subgroups (p=0.04; Figure 4B), and a Cox
regression analysis found that being in the ACE2-high CD subclass was a significant
independent risk factor for surgery (OR 2.27; 95%CI, 1.07-4.80; p=0.032; Table 2). Taken
together, in this study we discovered that ACE2 expression (mRNA and protein) stratifies two
distinct molecular subtypes of CD and that the patients in the ACE2-high subtype have a
significantly greater risk of worse clinical outcome and eventual surgery.

Discussion
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been thrust into the limelight given its role
as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. ACE2 is the
key effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, mediates vasoconstriction and sodium and
water retention both directly and indirectly by stimulating aldosterone secretion. While the
impact of ACE2 activity on response to infection is still under debate because no direct evidence
has been reported, it is implicated in the response to inflammation and regulation of tissue
repair in many organs. 14, 15
A recent single cell (sc) RNA-seq study demonstrated that the ACE2-positive-cell ratio
along the intestinal tract was significantly higher than in the lung

14

. In the lung, co-morbidities

dramatically increase alveolar ACE2 expression and are associated with poor outcomes16.
Furthermore, disease location is a critical determinant of intestinal expression of ACE2
(proteinatlas.org). We reveal through generation and analysis of adult colon RNA-seq data and
joint analysis with published adult and pediatric ileal RNA-seq data sets in CD patients that
expression of ACE2 defines two molecular phenotypes of CD, the ACE2-low and ACE2-high
patient subsets. Using IHC in matched colon and ileum samples, we validate ACE2 protein
expression in apical colonocytes and villus enterocytes for these two patient subsets, as well as
NIBD patients.
Our longitudinal analysis from time of CD diagnosis revealed that ACE2-high adult CD
patients were associated with increased risk for surgery in the first 5 years after diagnosis.

Interestingly, in contrast to worse outcomes in ACE2-high colon expressing adults, reduced ileal
ACE2 expression in CD patients (N=50) in the Pediatric RISK Stratification cohort was
significantly associated with colon and ileum disease involvement (p=0.0014), deeper ileal
ulcers (p=0.0002), and macroscopic ileal inflammation (p=0.0156) compared to pediatric ileal
ACE2-high (N=50) patients. These regional differences in ACE2 expression suggest that active
intestinal inflammation alters ACE2 expression, with opposing regulation in ileum and colon17, 18.
There are several points that must be noted with regard to future comparison of our findings
with other studies. First, patient selection is critical as is tissue of origin for analysis, including
the inflammatory state of the tissue, which can impact gene expression and interpretation of the
results 5. Second, ACE2 expression in the intestine increases with age, making it important to
critically evaluate its role separately in different age 5groups. Finally, while differences between
IBD and NIBD is important, our molecular stratification of CD patients allows for the
investigation of two distinct molecular subtypes linked to different clinical phenotypes.
In the small intestine, inflammation and the specific anatomical location were also shown
to influence expression of ACE2 in patients with IBD4. We and others showed that in all
intestinal segments, ACE2 expression is much higher in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)
compared to other cells types19 (proteinatlas.org). Therefore, understanding how variation in
ACE2 expression and function in IECs impacts IBD activity and COVID-19 severity in IBD
patients is critical for managing these individuals. Data from the ongoing SECURE-IBD registry
(covidibd.org) indicates unsurprisingly that corticosteroid use increases the risk of severe
COVID-19 outcomes >5-fold in IBD patients. Recently, Lukin et al. showed within an inpatient
IBD cohort that severe sequelae of COVID-19 were lower than in matched non-IBD controls
suggesting a protective effect

20

. It remains to be seen if variable colonic or ileal ACE2

expression in response to IBD therapeutics is responsible for these observations.

The biological mechanisms impacted by ACE2 in the intestine remain largely unknown
and warrant further study. ACE2 functions in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS),
counterbalancing the deleterious effects of angiotensin II on the cardiovascular system21.
Intestinal ACE2 is a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, a complex in IECs which
regulates the gut microbiota21. Gut microbiota composition and function, particularly the
presence and activity of bacterial and viral pathogens, greatly influence local and systemic
immune responses in IBD22. Mechanisms driving expression of ACE2 and its co-receptor
TMPRSS2 remain unclear. Using an elegant epigenetic approach coupled with genetically
manipulated murine models, Chen et al., found CDX2, HNF4, SMAD4 and GATA transcription
factors bind near Ace2 and Tmprss2 resulting in altered chromatin looping and epigenetic
modifications with significant impact on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression19.

Our present study is significant because we show intestinal ACE2 expression is a
biomarker of CD prognosis. Given its well-described link to COVID-19 outcomes in the lung, it is
plausible that ACE2 may also serve as a possible injury outcome measure for COVID-19 in IBD.
The implications of molecular stratification of CD patients can lead to rapid modification of
current therapy in IBD patients impacting the natural course of disease. While actual evidence is
still scarce it is hoped that further understanding of the role of ACE2 in IBD pathology and
therapeutic responses will ground its use as a biomarker of disease activity and treatment
responses contributing to the refinement and development of new therapeutic strategies.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Molecular subtypes of colonic CD. Ileum-like CD (IL) patients express ACE2 and
other key marker genes at significantly higher levels than in colon-like CD (CL) patients (*Adj.
P< 0.05; **Adj. P<0.005;*** Adj. P<1x10-6).

Figure 2. ACE2 IHC reveals increased expression in IL vs CL CD patients. Matched human
ileum and colon tissue biopsies from non-IBD (NIBD), CL, and IL patients were stained for antiACE2 antibody (pink). Slides were then incubated with DAPI (blue), and ACE2 fluorescent
signal intensity was measured using the ImageJ software and normalized to background. N=4
patients per group. Intensity measurements were averaged per patient and normalized to NIBD
group. Significance was determined via one-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons. *Adj.
P<0.05, **Adj. P<0.005, ***Adj. P<0.001.
Figure 3. Independent cohorts of adult CD and treatment-naïve pediatric CD ileum samples
show similar molecular subtypes. (A) PCA of combined RNA-seq data from adult colon tissue
and pediatric ileum tissue from CD and NIBD patients replicates ACE2-High and ACE2-low
(PC2) subtypes. (B) Patients from the two extremes of PC2 (panel A; N=50, each direction)
show significantly different Ileal expression levels of ACE2 (P<1x10-6). (C) PCA of combined
RNA-seq data from another independent cohort of adult colon tissue and adult ileum tissue from
CD and NIBD patients also replicates ACE2-High and ACE2-low (PC2) subtypes. (D) Patients
from the two extremes of PC2 (panel C; N=30 each direction) show significantly different Ileal
expression levels of ACE2 (P<1x10-6).
Figure 4. Increased colonic ACE2 expression is associated with a higher risk of surgery in CD
patients. (A) ACE2 expression was quantified in colonic specimens obtained from 39 additional
CD patients (‘Unknown’ ACE2 expression levels) by qPCR and compared with those from 8
NIBD controls, 8 ACE-low CD, and 6 ACE-high CD patients. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
