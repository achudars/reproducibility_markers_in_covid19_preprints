ABSTRACT

22

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the global

23

pandemic of COVID-19, and no effective antiviral agents and vaccines are available.

24

SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) agent, impeding the basic

25

research into its biology and the development of effective antivirals. Here, we

26

developed a biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) cell culture system for production of

27

transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP). This

28

trVLP expresses a reporter gene (GFP) replacing viral nucleocapsid gene (N), which is

29

required for viral genome packaging and virion assembly (SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N

30

trVLP). The complete viral life cycle can be achieved and exclusively confined in the

31

cells ectopically expressing SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 N proteins, but not MERS-

32

CoV N. Genetic recombination of N supplied in trans into viral genome was not

33

detected, as evidenced by sequence analysis after one-month serial passages in the N-

34

expressing cells. Moreover, intein-mediated protein trans-splicing approach was

35

utilized to split the viral N gene into two independent vectors, and the ligated viral N

36

protein could function in trans to recapitulate entire viral life cycle, further securing the

37

biosafety of this cell culture model. Based on this BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 cell culture

38

model, we developed a 96-well format high throughput screening for antivirals

39

discovery. We identified salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium, lycorine

40

chloride and nigericin sodium as potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

41

Collectively, we developed a convenient and efficient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics

42

tool to dissect the virus life cycle under a BSL-2 condition. This powerful tool should

43

accelerate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and its antiviral development.

INTRODUCTION

49

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory

50

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing pandemic1. As of 1 December

51

2020, more than 63.7 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported, resulting in more

52

than 1.5 million deaths. Severe patients died of breathing difficulty to acute respiratory

53

distress. Up to now, there is still no vaccine and antiviral agents available2.

54

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Coronavirus, the family Coronaviridae, and

55

the order Nidovirales. Its genome is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with similar

56

specific gene characteristics of known coronaviruses3. The viral genome encodes non-

57

structural proteins, structural proteins and accessory proteins. The non-structural

58

proteins carry all of the enzymatic activities important for viral replication. For example,

59

the genome encodes an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase complex (nsp7, nsp8 and

60

nsp12), RNA capping machinery (nsp10, nsp13, nsp14 and 16) and additional enzymes

61

such as proteases (the nsp3 PLpro and the nsp5 3CLpro) which cleave viral

62

polyproteins4,5. Structural proteins include surface (S), envelope (E), membrane (M),

63

and nucleocapsid (N) proteins6. The S, E and M proteins are embedded within the lipid

64

envelope. The primary function of N protein is to package the ∼30 kb single stranded,

65

5′-capped positive-strand viral genome RNA into a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.

66

Ribonucleocapsid packaging is a fundamental part of viral self-assembly, and the RNP

67

complex constitutes the essential template for replication by the RNA-dependent RNA

68

polymerase complex7. In addition, the N protein has been shown to modulate the host

69

antiviral responseand may play regulatory roles in the viral life cycle3. The accessory

70

proteins, encoded by ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 genes, are not directly

71

involved in viral replication but interfere with the host innate immune response or are

72

of unknown function3,8,9.

73

The development of reverse genetics systems of coronavirus has profoundly

74

advanced the study of this large-sized RNA virus. The cDNA of the coronavirus RNA

75

genome is constructed using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), in vitro ligation

76

of CoV cDNA fragments, or vaccinia viral vector10. Recently, a SARS-CoV-2 full3

77

length cDNA clone has been established using the in vitro ligation of cDNA

78

fragments11,12. This system has been shown to be efficient for the recovery of infectious

79

virus, and a reporter gene can be inserted into the viral genome to monitor virus

80

replication, providing a good tool for high-throughput antiviral screening. However,

81

experimentations involving live virus are restricted to BSL-3 laboratories, which

82

hinders the study of SARS-CoV-2 and development of countermeasures. Therefore, it

83

is urgent to develop an efficient non-BSL-3 experimental system for SARS-CoV-2.

84

Herein, we developed an N-based genetic complementation system to produce

85

biologically contained, and transcription, replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-

86

like particles lacking N gene (SARS-CoV-2 N trVLP). The lack of the viral N protein

87

could be genetically complemented in trans by ectopic expression in packaging cells to

88

produce the SARS-CoV-2 N trVLP. SARS-CoV-2 N trVLP could be propagated and

89

passaged in the packaging cells while only results in single-round infection in wild-type

90

cells. We applied this cell culture model for SARS-CoV-2 biology, antiviral evaluation

91

and novel antivirals discovery.

RESULTS

94

Design and assembly of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N genome

95

Nucleocapsid translated from a subgenomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 has multiple

96

functions and its primary function is participation in genomic RNA package and virus

97

particle release. To test whether the function of N could be complemented in trans, we

98

constructed SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N genome, in which we replaced the regions encoding

99

viral N (from nucleotides position 28274 to 29533) based on MN908947 genome with

100

GFP reporter gene, and Caco-2 cells, an immortalized cell line of human colorectal

101

adenocarcinoma cells, as packaging cell lines which stably express viral N protein by

102

lentiviral transduction (Fig. 1).

103

To assemble the molecular clone of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N genome, we utilized

104

an in vitro ligation approach, which has been used for constructing the infectious clone

105

of SARS-CoV-211,12. We divided the full-length cDNA of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N

106

genome into a set of five fragments (A, B, C, D and E) and each fragment can be

107

obtained by PCR using the chemically synthesized viral genome (MN908947 strain) as

108

the template. Each DNA fragment was flanked by a type IIS restriction endonuclease

109

site (BsaI or BsmBI) that ensures unidirectional assembly of intermediates into a full-

110

length cDNA. In addition, we engineered a T7 promoter upstream of fragment A and a

111

poly(A) tails at the downstream of fragment E, allowing for in vitro transcription of

112

capped, polyadenylated transcript of viral genome (Fig. 1A).

113

The five PCR-amplified DNA fragments were digested with BsaI or BsmBI to

114

generate specific sticky ends (Fig. 1B). The digested fragments were further purified

115

and were ligated by T4 DNA ligase at 4°C to generate the full-length cDNA of SARS-

116

CoV-2-GFP/N genome. The resulting 29.4-Kbp in vitro ligation products were

117

confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Next, this in vitro ligation products

118

were used as the template for in vitro transcription with the T7 RNA polymerase to

119

generate the RNA transcript of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N genome (Fig. 1D).

120

Recovery and propagation of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP

121

Caco-2 cells are highly permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As the recombinant

122

SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N virus like particles, lacking N gene, could potentially propagate

123

in the cells supplied with viral N protein in trans, we established the Caco-2 cells stably

124

expressing viral N gene by lentiviral transduction (designated as Caco-2-N cells). The

125

expression of N was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting assay (Fig. S1A,

126

B and Fig. 1E).

127

Next, we sought to recover SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP, the in vitro transcribed

128

RNA transcript of viral genome was electroporated into Caco-2-N cells. Within 48h,

129

GFP fluorescence can be readily observed, suggesting that viral genome replication and

130

transcription occurs in the cell. After 96h, cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in

131

the electroporated Caco-2-N cells, suggesting that the recombinant SARS-CoV-2-

132

GFP/N trVLP was produced and propagated (Fig. S2). We collected the cell culture

133

supernatants (denoted as passage 0 (P0) virus), and inoculated them to Caco-2 or Caco-

134

2-N cells (Fig. 2A). GFP signal can be readily observed within 48 h, and further

135

expanded within 72 h in Caco-2-N cells, whereas no signal was detected in Caco-2 cells

136

(Fig. 2B). Cells were collected for immunoblotting and RT-qPCR analysis at 72 h post-

137

infection to detect viral spike antigen and RNA abundance. Consistent with the GFP

138

expression, we could detect viral spike expression and high abundance of viral RNA in

139

the Caco-2-N cells but not in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2C and D). RT-PCR analysis using a

140

primer set outside the N-encoding region confirmed that the N gene was indeed

141

replaced by GFP in the recombinant trVLP viral genome (Fig. 2E).

142

To characterize the SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP infection, two spike-specific

143

mAbs (1F11 and 2F6)13 were tested for their ability to neutralize infection of Caco-2-

144

N cells. A neutralizing mAb specific for HIV gp120 (VRC-01) was also included as the

145

control14. The mAbs were incubated with SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP for 1 h at 37°C,

146

and the trVLP–mAb mixtures were tested for infection of Caco-2-N cells, respectively.

147

Viral infection was determined by flow cytometry at 48 h post-infection, and the results

148

showed that 1F11 and 2F6 inhibited trVLP infection in a dose-dependent manner; in

149

contrast, VRC01 had no effect on the trVLP infection (Fig. 2F).

151

spike protein and inhibit its interaction with cellular ACE215,16. We therefore tested the

152

ability of mouse IgG Fc fusion proteins of soluble human ACE2 (D30E) (hACE2

153

(D30E)-Fc)16 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP infection. F10scFv, an antibody

154

specifically targeting HA of the Influenza A virus, was used as a negative control. The

155

hACE2 (D30E)-Fc trVLP showed a dose-dependent neutralization of infectivity,

156

inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N infection of Caco-2-N cells by 70% at 0.5μg/ml (Fig

157

2G). Together, these data demonstrated that the infection of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N

158

trVLP recapitulates that of wild-type virus as its virus entry is also mediated by the

159

interaction between viral spike and host ACE2.

160

Characterization of the genetic stability of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP

161

Next, we sought to characterize the genetic stability of SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N

162

trVLP. For this purpose, we analyzed the rescued SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP in

163

Caco-2-N cells after 10 passage. The cell culture supernatants collected from SARS-

164

CoV-2-GFP/N RNA electroporated Caco-2-N cells were defined as P0, and the cell

165

cultures collected from each subsequent passage on the Caco-2-N cells were defined as

166

P1 to P10, respectively. The total RNAs extracted from each cell passage were used to

167

perform RT-PCRs with the pair of primers to amplify the fragment between ORF8 and

168

3’UTR that covers the region of the inserted GFP reporter gene. (Fig.3A). RT–PCR

169

products of 1.5-Kbp and 1-Kbp were expected for WT genome and SARS-CoV-2-

170

GFP/N genome, respectively. SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP was considerably stable

171

for at least 3 serial passages since the 1-Kb RT–PCR products were detected at P3 trVLP

172

(Fig. 3B). The loss of GFP reporter gene was detected in the P4 trVLP as indicated by

173

amplicon of < 1 Kb size (Fig. 3B, Fig S3A). No PCR product of greater than 1 Kb was

174

detected in the all samples, suggesting that no heterologous RNA inserted into the

175

SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N genome, at least in the GFP report region.

176

To characterize the trVLP sequence variations in an unbiased manner, we

177

performed deep sequencing analysis on the P1 and P10 trVLP genome. The deep

178

sequencing analysis provides deep coverage, on the order of 30 million reads per

179

sequencing sample (Fig. S3B). Sequences of P1 or P10 were mapped to the SARS7

180

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N trVLP genomes, respectively (Fig. 3C and D) and

181

relative abundances of these sequences between P1 and P10, were also compared (Fig

182

3E, Fig S3C). The deep sequencing analysis could not detect N sequences in the both

183

P0 and P10 genome (Fig. 3C), and GFP sequences were readily detected in the P1

184

genome with high abundance, however, it was rarely detected in the P10 genome (Fig.

185

3D), due to GFP sequences deletion (Fig. 3B, Fig S3A). Additionally, we found that

186

the subgenomic RNAs of ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8 were dramatically decreased in the

187

P10-trVLP infected cells compared with that of P1 VLP (Fig. 3E), indicating that ORF6,

188

ORF7 and ORF8 may not be required for virus infection at least in vitro, consistent with

189

other reports that deletions of these regions were observed in clinical samples by deep

190

sequencing analysis17-20.

191

Reconstitution of functional N protein by split intein-mediated protein ligation

192

Inteins are intervening protein sequences within a host protein that mediate their

193

self-excision from the precursor protein and ligates the flanking N- and C-terminal

194

fragments (exteins)21. Split inteins are a subset of inteins that are expressed as two

195

separate polypeptides at the ends of two host proteins and catalyze their trans-splicing,

196

resulting in the generation of a single larger polypeptide (Fig. 4A). To further minimize

197

the chance of recombination of N into the SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N genome, we aimed

198

to split the N gene into two separate elements using a naturally split intein embedded

199

within the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase III (DnaE) in many species of

200

cyanobacteria (Npu intein)22. Npu intein activity is context-dependent, and Cys as first

201

residue in the C-extein is required for efficient trans-splicing. However, there is no Cys

202

residue in SARS-CoV-2 N protein. In order to split the N, we had to find the appropriate

203

splice sites that would have two well-folded, yet stable protein fragments, and also

204

substitute first residue in the C-extein with Cys without disruption of N protein function.

205

To locate the splice sites according to these requirements we chose three splice sites in

206

the N protein, to have the N-intein A152C, S176C and G212C (Fig. 4A). As for each

207

of N-intein above, we constructed two lentivirus vectors encoding either the N- or the

208

C-terminal half of the N protein fused to the N- and C-terminal halves of the Npu intein,

209

having NN-IntN and IntC-NC, respectively (Fig. 4A). Each lentivirus vector included

210

appropriate regulatory elements (promoter and a polyadenylation signal) and a Flag tag

211

to allow detection of the full-length reconstituted N protein (Fig. 4A). We then

212

transduced NN-IntN and IntC-NC either individually or together in Caco-2 cells, and the

213

full-length N protein reconstitution was assessed by Western blotting assay. We could

214

not detect splicing above negligible levels of N protein by N-intein (A152C) (lane 2,

215

Fig. 4B), while N-intein (S176C) and N-intein (G212C) could reconstitute into full-

216

length N protein with S176C or G212C point mutation, respectively (lane 5 and 8, Fig.

217

4B). Next, recombinant SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP (P1) was inoculated to Caco-2

218

cells transduced with N-intein as indicated, and GFP fluorescence was detected after

219

two days only in the cells transduced either with a single lentivirus that encodes full-

220

length N or with the combination of N-intein (G212C), but not in the cells with the

221

single N- and C-terminal N-intein (G212C). As expected, GFP fluorescence was also

222

not detected in cells transduced with N-intein (A152C), of which the splicing did not

223

occur; interestingly, N-intein (S176C) could ligate a full-length N (S176C), but fails to

224

support virus infection, suggesting that the S176C mutation probably impairs N protein

225

function (Fig. 4C and D). Consistent with the GFP expression, the subgenomic RNA

226

of E can be readily detected in cells transduced either with a single lentivirus that

227

encodes full-length N or with the combination of N-intein (G212C), but not others (Fig.

228

4E). Together, we showed that the N-intein (G212C) was capable of efficiently trans-

229

splicing to generate a functional N (G212C) protein to support SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N

230

trVLP infection. As the N-intein was split into separate constructs, it would further

231

reduce the potential biosafety concerns of this SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP cell culture

232

model.

233

Residue-specific phosphorylation of N protein is critical for viral infectivity

234

Coronavirus N protein is an extensively phosphorylated, highly basic, vital

235

structural protein the primary function of which is to form a helical ribonucleoprotein

236

complex with viral RNA (RNP) as core structure of the virion. A variety of other

237

functions have been ascribed, such as viral genome transcription and replication, or

238

evasion of antiviral immunity. SARS‐CoV‐2 N protein is highly homologous to the N

239

protein of SARS‐CoV, with 91% identity, while exhibited 48% identity with that of

240

MERS-CoV (Fig. 5A). Several proteomics profiling analyses have been performed and

241

reveals that N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is extensively phosphorylated at multiple sites

242

(Fig. 5A and Fig. S4). However, the roles of N protein phosphorylation remain unclear.

243

Our N-based genetic trans-complemented cell culture model offers an opportunity to

244

specifically study N protein function in viral life cycle. Firstly, we determined whether

245

SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP infection can be complemented by N proteins from

246

different coronavirues. We used SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP to infect the Caco-2 cells

247

transduced with N from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Two days later, the

248

cell culture supernatants from each cells were collected to infect naive Caco-2 cells

249

transduced with SARS-CoV-2 (Caco-2-N cells as previously used) to test whether

250

SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP were assembled in the Caco-2 cells transduced with

251

distinct N proteins. Two days later, the Caco-2-N cells were collected and GFP or viral

252

RNA was quantified by flow cytometry or RT-qPCR, respectively (Fig. 5B and C).

253

SARS-CoV N protein with 91% identity with that of SARS-CoV-2, but not MERS-

254

CoV N protein with 48% identity with that of SARS-CoV-2, could rescue SARS-CoV-

255

2 GFP/N trVLP, (Fig. 5D and E), suggesting that coronavirus N protein has virus-

256

specific mechanism to recognize viral genome to achieve its function, meanwhile, N

257

proteins from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, with high genetic similarity, have

258

redundant function to some degree.

259

As SARS-CoV-2 N is heavily phosphorylated at multiple sites especially within

260

the central Ser-Arg (SR)-rich motif, we are interested in the roles of phosphorylation in

261

N function. For this purpose, we mutated S176, S413, S176/413, S105, S183, S188,

262

S206, S188/206 as the conservation of these residues with that of SARS-CoV into

263

alanine to specifically dissect their function. Notably, GSK-3 is the kinase responsible

264

for the phosphorylation of this SR-rich motif in SARS-CoV N protein, which are

265

primed by the phosphorylation of Ser-189 and Ser-207 (Ser-188 and Ser-206 in SARS-

266

CoV-2 N protein accordingly)23,24. We generated the Caco-2 cells lentivirally

transduced with the N variants as indicated. As shown in Western blotting assay, the

268

mutations did not alter the protein expression and stability in the Caco-2 cell (Fig. 5F),

269

We noted that N with the S188A/S206A double mutations migrated slightly faster than

270

WT and other mutants, probably because blockade of the initial priming

271

phosphorylation would prohibit subsequent phosphorylation events by GSK-3, which

272

was observed in SARS-CoV23. Next, we inoculated the Caco-2 cells expressing

273

different N variants with SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP, and cell culture supernatant was

274

collected 48 h later to infect the naïve Caco-2-N cells, and cells were collected to

275

observe or determine GFP expressing by microscopy or flow cytometry 2 days later.

276

Interestingly, most of the phosphorylation null mutants were able to assemble virus-like

277

particles with comparable or slightly reduced efficiencies than WT. However,

278

S188A/S206A double mutations completely abolish N function (Fig. 5G-H),

279

highlighting the critical role of S188 and S206 for N function.

280

To further investigate whether GSK-3 contributing N protein phosphorylation to

281

regulate virus life cycle, we treated Caco-2-N cells with LiCl or SB216763, which are

282

specific inhibitors of GSK-3 and inoculated cells with SARS-CoV-2 trVLP

283

spontaneously. Two days later, cell culture medium was collected and infect Caco-2-N

284

cells for additional 2 days, and then cells were harvested for flow cytometry analysis of

285

GFP expression. As expected, the LiCl or SB216763 could inhibit GFP expression in a

286

dose-dependent manner, indicating that inhibition of GSK-3 could block N

287

phosphorylation, thus impairing SARS-CoV-2 trVLP production. Given the vital role

288

of the N protein in multiple stages of the viral life cycle, inhibition of N functions by

289

modulating host cell kinases may be viable strategies for combating SARS‐CoV‐2

290

infections.

Evaluation of the antivirals using SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N VLP cell culture model

292

To test the utility of this system in anti-viral drug screening, we evaluated the

293

efficacy of IFN-remdesivir, GC376, lopinavir, and ritonavir in inhibiting SARS-

294

CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP infection. Caco-2-N-intein (G212C) cells were treated with IFN-

296

SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. After 48 h,

297

the cells were collected and GFP fluorescence, the proxy of virus infection, was

298

quantified by flow cytometry analysis. Remarkably, even at 0.2 pg/ml IFN- we

299

observed 60% reduction of the GFP fluorescence (Fig. 6A). This is consistent with

300

recent reports that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to type I interferon treatment11,25-27.

301

Remdesivir and GC376, which targets virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)

302

and 3CLpro respectively, have been reported to be potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-

303

228-32. Lopinavir and ritonavir-HIV protease inhibitor, is a combination antiviral

304

medicine used to treat HIV33, which could inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

305

infection in vitro, and they may target SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 (3CLpro) to inhibit virus

306

infection. To test potential dose-dependent antiviral activity of those drugs in our

307

system, we incubated Caco-2-N-intein (G212C) cells with various concentrations of

308

those drugs and simultaneously infected the cells with SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP at

309

a MOI of 0.05. After 2 days, GFP fluorescence was determined (Fig.6 B-E). Remdesivir

310

and GC376 exhibited potent antiviral effect with IC50=62.5 nM and 4.5 M respectively,

311

with essentially no apparent cytotoxic effect (Fig.6 B and C). In contrast, Lopinavir or

312

ritonavir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP with IC50=8.7 uM, or 7.7 uM, while

313

those drugs both show serious cytotoxicity at the IC50 concentration (Fig.6 D and E),

314

compromising their clinical utilities, which is in line with the fact that lopinavir and

315

ritonavir as no significant beneficial effect was observed in a randomized trial

316

established in March 2020 with a total of 1,596 patients34.

317

These results demonstrated that our experimental system can be used for

318

evaluation of antivirals and could be potentially developed for high-throughput

319

screening of antiviral compounds.

To provide proof-of-concept that our system could be utilized in high-throughput

screening, we performed HTS of Topscience natural product library containing 377

drugs (Fig. 7A) and the potential hit compounds were further assessed using authentic

325

SARS-CoV-2 to confirm the antiviral activities in vitro. DMSO or remdesivir were

326

included as the negative or positive control.

327

Among the 377 compounds of the compound library, 10 hit molecules showed

328

equal or higher inhibition with an inhibitory efficiency ≥ 60% (Fig. 7A). In addition,

329

we excluded five hits due to the visible cytotoxicity. This criterion allowed the selection

330

of five hits as the highest confident hits: salinomycin, tubeimoside I, monensin sodium,

331

lycorine chloride and nigericin sodium (Fig. 7A). Among these five compounds,

332

lycorine chloride, salinomycin and monensin sodium inhibit HCoV-OC43 infection as

333

previously reported35 and monensin sodium blocks avian infectious bronchitis virus

334

(IBV) infection36. Notably, a recent study demonstrated that salinomycin possessed a

335

potent antiviral activity to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro37, which further

336

demonstrated that our system could be used for HTP antiviral screening. We next

337

determined the IC50 of the hit compounds using authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus.

338

Salinomycin showed SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity with an IC50 and CC50 of 2.836

339

and 20.23 µM, respectively, and selectivity index (SI = CC50/IC50) of 7.13. In

340

comparison, other four compounds did not show dramatic cytotoxic effect in the tested

341

concentrations. Of note, tubeimosde I exhibited an IC50 of 1.371 µM; monensin sodium

342

exhibited an IC50 of 0.632 µM; lycorine chloride showed antiviral activity with an IC50

343

of 0.773 µM, and nigericin sodium, exhibited an IC50 of 11.25 µM. These results

344

demonstrated that the compounds we identified using SARS-CoV-2 GFP/N trVLP

345

system exhibited potent antiviral activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and

346

our screening provided new candidate compounds to effectively treat infection of

347

SARS-CoV-2.

DISCUSSION

351

As its high pathogenicity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics,

352

SARS-CoV-2 is classified as a biological safety level 3 (BSL-3) pathogen38, which has

353

hindered the drug discovery and biological research due to biocontainment

354

requirements. In this study, we developed an in vitro cell culture system to produce the

355

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the N-encoding region in the viral genome

356

(SARS-CoV-2 N). Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N can expand and propagate in

357

packaging cells (Caco-2-N) but results in only single-cycle infection in naïve Vero or

358

Caco-2 cells, which biologically contained the virus in the cells expressing N protein.

359

This BSL-2 SARS-CoV-2 possesses a reporter gene GFP, providing a surrogate readout

360

for authentic viral infection. We monitored the recombinant virus infection in the Caco-

361

2-N cells for one month and NGS sequencing result suggested that no recombination

362

was detected. In addition, we utilized the split intein-mediated protein ligation to

363

reconstitute N function which further ensure the biosafety of this system.

364

This cell model represents a unique system in the basic research application for

365

better understanding SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Virus has evolved since its outbreak in

366

the end of last year, and some mutations or deletions have been observed. However, the

367

functional consequences of these mutations or deletions on virus infectivity or

368

pathogenesis is poorly characterized. Herein, we utilized our model system to study the

369

roles of N in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Since N can be expressed alone in trans, it is

370

convenient to perform mutagenesis on N to dissect its detailed function. Moreover, the

371

introduction of mutations in trans-expressed N will avoid the cis effects of the

372

mutations, for example, the disruption of critical RNA secondary or tertiary structures

373

in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, thereby providing a more appropriate system to

374

specifically evaluate the biological roles of domains, motifs, or amino acid residues

375

within the N protein. Additionally, we inserted a Flag tag at the C terminus of N, which

376

did not impair the ability of N to rescue viral production. With this Flag tag, N can be

377

detected and immunoprecipitated by an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. S4A). Multiple

378

amino acids in N protein can be phosphorylated, but our data demonstrated that most
14

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.13.422469; this version posted December 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this

379

of these phosphorylation may not be required for N function at least in vitro. Meanwhile,

380

we also identified numerous host factors associated with N protein (Fig. S4A; Table

381

S2), notably, we also found that N protein could interact with G3BP1 and G3BP2, the

382

stress granule assembly proteins, which was in line with previous studies39,40. Recent

383

studies found that N protein could impair the stress granule assembly to escape the

384

antiviral effect40,41. Thus, the trVLP system provides a new tool to study host factors

385

and viral proteins that may interact with N during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

386

Development of effective therapeutics for COVID-19 remains an urgently unmet

387

medical need. This recombinant trVLP recapitulates the complete SARS-CoV-2 life-

388

cycle in the Caco-2-N or Caco-2-Nintein cells. The reporter readout of the virus, such as

389

fluorescent proteins or luminescent proteins, offers a rapid, real-time, quantitative and

390

less labor-intensive measures than traditional methods of viral titer reduction.

391

Importantly, the reporter virus-based assay could cooperate with a BSL-2 compatible

392

high-content screening platform to facilitate antiviral screening. Thus, we developed a

393

96-well format to screen the antiviral compounds in the Topscience Natural Compounds

394

Library, and we identified five compounds which could efficiently block SARS-CoV-2

395

infection. Among them, lycorine, salinomycin and monensin have been reported as the

396

potent inhibitors against HCoV-OC43 infection35, and salinomycin could block SARS-

397

CoV-2 infection as reported recently37. Those data further validate the suitability of our

398

trVLP system in drug discovery. In our screening, we identified Tubeimoside I and

399

nigericin sodium as novel compounds which exhibited potent antiviral activities against

400

authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Future studies could be performed to evaluate

401

their antiviral activities in vivo.

402

Additionally, there is an urgently need for effective vaccines to contain SARS-

403

CoV-2 pandemic38. The recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lacking of N gene should provide a

404

new means of vaccine development. The greatest advantage of SARS-CoV-2 N is that

405

this virus possesses all the structural viral proteins to induce humoral immune responses

406

and that, upon infection, it could produce all the nonstructural viral proteins in host cells

407

to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Of course, further studies, especially in

408

animals, are needed to determine the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of it.

409

In summary, the biologically contained SARS-CoV-2 trVLP lacking the N gene

410

represents a safe, alternative experimental system to study SARS-CoV-2 biology and

411

to screen antiviral compounds and this novel system will greatly accelerate current

412

SARS-CoV-2 research efforts.

MATERIALS And METHODS

439

Cell culture. HEK293T, Vero, Vero E6, A549 and Caco-2 cells were maintained in

440

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, China) supplemented with 10%

441

(vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 50 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin in a

442

humidified 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator at 37°C. All cell lines were tested negative for

443

mycoplasma.

444

Cloning of the SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N cDNA. cDNAs (Wuhan-Hu-1, MN908947) of

445

SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N were synthesized from the GenScript company. PCR was

446

conducted to amplify fragments A, B, C, D and E using high fidelity PrimeSTAR Max

447

DNA Polymerase (Takara). T7 promoter was introduced upstream of 5’ UTR of SARS-

448

CoV-2 genome in fragment A. To guarantee a seamless assembly of the full-length

449

cDNA, type IIS restriction endonuclease sites (BsaI or BsmBI) were introduced at both

450

ends of PCR fragments. The primers used for the PCR assay were listed in

451

Supplemental Table 1.

452

Assembly of a Full-Length SARS-CoV-2-GFP/N cDNA. PCR fragments were

453

digested with BsaI or BsmBI restriction enzyme (NEB) to specific sticky end. Digested

454

fragments are purified by E.Z.N.A gel extraction kit (Omega). Fragment A, B are

455

ligated first by T4 DNA ligase (NEB) in 40l system. At the same time, fragments C,

456

D, E are also ligated in another tube at 4°C for 24 hours. Then, fragment A, B and C,

457

D, E are combined together added with 2l T4 DNA ligase buffer and 2l T4 DNA

458

ligase to 100l at 4℃ for another 24 hours. At the end of ligation, we took 5l product

459

to run an agarose gel to check the efficiency of ligation. Full-length assembly cDNA

460

was phenol/chloroform extracted, isopropanol precipitated, and resuspended in 10L

containing 0.4 mL of Caco-2-N cells (8×106) in Opti-MEM. Single electrical pulse was

467

given with a GenePulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) with setting of 270V at 950F. GFP signal

468

can be observed 17 hours post electroporation. Three days post electroporation, P0 virus

469

was collected and Caco-2-N cells were infected with P0 virus to amplify virus.

470

Lentivirus packaging. Vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped

471

lentiviruses were produced by transient cotransfection of the third-generation

472

packaging plasmids pMD2G (catalog no. 12259; Addgene), psPAX2 (catalog number

473

12260; Addgene) and the transfer vector pLVX by VigoFect DNA transfection reagent

474

(Vigorous) into HEK293T cells. The medium was changed 12 h post transfection.

475

Supernatants were collected at 36, 60 and 84 h after transfection, pooled, passed

476

through a 0.45-µm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at -80°C refrigerator.

477

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRNzol reagent

478

(Thermo, 15596018). To analyze the RNA level of SARS-CoV-2 in infected cells,

479

quantitative real-time PCR was performed. In brief, 1μg total RNA was reverse

480

transcribed using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, FSQ-101) to produce cDNA

481

with random primers. Reactions of qPCR were carried out using the 2×RealStar Green

482

Power Mixture (Genstar, A311) according to the instruction. The qPCR primers for

483

viral RNA were as follows: THU-2190 (5’- CGAAAGGTAAGATGGAGAGCC-3’)

484

and THU-2191 (5’- TGTTGACGTGCCTCTGATAAG-3’). The sequences of the qPCR

485

primers for GAPDH was described previously42. Relative expression levels of the target

486

genes were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. All data

487

were normalized relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.

488

RNA-seq and data analysis. Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol™ Reagent

489

(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The rRNAs were removed by

490

using Ribo-Zero Gold module of Illumina TruSeq stranded total RNA library prep kit

491

(RS-122-2201) and then cDNA libraries were constructed according to the

492

manufacturer’s protocol. RNA-seq was performed by using the Illumina Novaseq

493

platform. The reference genome of SARS2 (MN908947) was downloaded from

494

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore /MN908947. After removing low-quality

495

reads, remaining Illumina sequence reads were mapped to human (GRCh38) and

496

SARS2 genome by using HISAT2.1.0 with parameters: --rna-strandness RF –dta.

497

RNA-seq coverage was visualized by using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV). To

498

quantifiy the expression levels of SARS2 genes, RPKM of each virus genes and GFP

499

gene were calculated. Heatmaps were drawn by using R package “pheatmap”

500

(https://www.r-project.org). To quantify the junction-reads from subgenomic RNAs,

501

the STAR2.7.5c was used for reads mapping. The junction-reads was defined and

502

collected as described in Kim, Cell, 2020. A Sankey diagram was drawn by using R

503

packages named “networkD3” and “dplyr”.

504

IFN-, neutralizing antibody and drug treatment. To assess the antiviral efficacies

505

of the materials, 1×104 Caco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plates. After 12h, cells

506

were infected with SARS-CoV-2-GFPN virus at MOI of 0.05. For neutralizing

507

antibody treatment, virus was incubated with neutralizing antibody for 1 hour at 37°C

508

before infection. For IFN-(Sino Bioligical, 10704-HNAS-5) test, cells were pre-

509

treated with IFN-for 8 hours before infection. For remdesivir (MedChemExpress,

510

HY-104077), lopinavir (biochempartner, BCP01395) or ritonavir (biochempartner,

511

BCP03777) treatment, drugs were added simultaneously upon infection. Two days after

512

infection, flow cytometry was performed to analyze GFP positive rate. The 50%

513

inhibitory concentrations (IC50; compound concentration required to inhibit viral

514

replication by 50% reduction of GFP positive cells) were determined using logarithmic

515

interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.

516

Cell viability assay. Caco-2-N cells were seeded into 96-well plate (1×103 cells/well).

517

After 12 hours, cells were treated with drugs with different concentrations. Cell

518

viability was measured two days post treatment with CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell

519

Viability Assay kit (Promega, G7570) following standard protocol. In brief, cells in 100

520

l culture medium were added with 100 l CellTiter-Glo reagent. After 15 minutes,

521

luminescence was recorded with GloMax (Promega). CC50 was determined using

522

logarithmic interpolation using GraphPad Prism software version 7.0.

524

then washed once with cold PBS. Cells were then fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes at

525

room temperature. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS and analyzed by LSRFortessa

526

SORP (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.

527

Western blotting. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-

528

PAGE) immunoblotting was conducted as follows: After trypsinization and cell

529

pelleting at 1500 r/m for 10 min, whole-cell lysates were harvested in cell lysis buffer

530

(50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1mM EDTA) supplemented with

531

protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Lysates were electrophoresed in 4-12%

532

polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The blots were blocked at

533

room temperature for 0.5 h using 5% nonfat milk in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)

534

containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. The blots were exposed to primary antibodies anti-N

535

554

CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and incubated in 2% FBS

555

culture medium for 24 h for viral antigen staining. Cells were fixed with 4%

556

paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with

557

the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland,

558

200-401-A50, 1μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. After three washes, cells were incubated with

559

the secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo

560

#A32732, 2 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by staining with 4’,6-

561

diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Images were collected using an Operetta High

562

Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer). For high content imaging, two biological

563

replicates for each concentration of drug were scanned and five representative fields

564

were selected for each well of 96-well plates. Image analysis was performed using the

565

PerkinElmer Harmony high-content analysis software 4.9. Cells were automatically

566

identified by DAPI (nuclei). Mean fluorescent intensity of channel Alexa 555 (viral

567

nucleocapsid) of each cell were subsequently calculated, respectively. For the 0%

568

inhibition control, cells were infected in the presence of vehicle only. The IC50 value

569

was defined as the concentration at which there was a 50% decrease in N protein

570

expression. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. The IC50 values were

571

calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using the dose-response (variable slope)

572

equation (four parameter logistic equation).

573

Statistical analysis. Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with

574

Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test was used to test for statistical

575

significance of the differences between the different group parameters. P values of less
