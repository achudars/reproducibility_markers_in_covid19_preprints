Abstract
The precise mechanisms by which Covid-19 infection leads to hypoxia and respiratory
failure have not yet been elucidated. Interactions between sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have been identified as participating in viral adherence
and infectivity. The spike glycoprotein binds to respiratory epithelium through the angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which endogenously interacts with Angiotensin (Ang) II to
yield Angiotensin 1-7. In this report, we show that stimulation of human vascular smooth muscle
cells by Ang II leads to increased mRNA expression of two chondroitin sulfotransferases (CHST11
and CHST15), which are required for synthesis of chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) and chondroitin 4,6disulfate (CSE), respectively. Also, increased total sulfated GAGs, increased sulfotransferase
activity, and increased expression of the proteoglycans biglycan, syndecan, perlecan, and
versican followed treatment by Ang II. Candesartan, an Angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb),
largely, but incompletely, inhibited these increases, and the differences from baseline remained
significant. These results suggest that another effect of Ang II also contributes to the increased
expression of chondroitin sulfotransferases, total sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans. We
hypothesize that activation of ACE2 may contribute to these increases and suggest that the
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction with ACE2 may also increase chondroitin
sulfotransferases, sulfated GAGs, and proteoglycans and thereby contribute to viral adherence
to bronchioalveolar cells and to respiratory compromise in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges, as the medical and scientific
communities develop new therapies, new diagnostic tests, and new insights into the mechanisms
by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus acts [1,2]. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Gene
ID=59272) is the target for the spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2
virus [3,4]. ACE2 is also the enzyme which converts Angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang (1-7), following
the conversion of Ang I to the octapeptide Ang II by the loss of two amino acids. Physiologically,
the vasodilator Ang (1-7) counteracts the vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II. The impact of the
commonly used anti-hypertensive medications, angiotensin 1 converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (Arb), on Covid-19 disease have been a subject of
intense discussion [5-7]. The experiments presented in this report were performed to detect
effects of activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on chondroitin sulfates and associated
proteoglycans, since these are largely unexplored. The experiments were performed to consider
how Ang II exposure and inhibition by Arb treatment affected the expression of chondroitin
sulfotransferases and associated proteoglycans in human vascular smooth muscle cells. In the
setting of the Covid-19 pandemic, the experimental findings have been considered in the context
of how interaction with ACE2 may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of Covid-19
infection, in relation to potential effects on chondroitin sulfotransferases and chondroitin sulfates.
Data are presented which show increased expression of the chondroitin sulfotransferases

S corresponds to sulfate) from chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S; [GlcA-GalNAc-4S]n). CSE is composed
of alternating β-1,4- and β-1,3- linked D-glucuronate and D-N-acetylgalactosamine-4S,6S

residues, and is found throughout human tissues. Increases in CHST15 or in CSE have been
recognized in malignant cells and tissues and in models of tumor progression and tissue
remodeling, including in pulmonary and cardiac tissues [8-10]. CHST11 is required for the
synthesis of C4S, which is widely distributed throughout mammalian tissues. Increases in C4S
are pathognomonic of congenital Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) VI, due to inherited mutations of
the enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) [11,12]. ARSB removes
the 4-sulfate group at the non-reducing end of C4S and is required for degradation of C4S and of
CSE. Accumulation of chondroitin sulfates contributes to pulmonary dysfunction in the
mucopolysaccharidoses, cystic fibrosis, and lung diseases [11-14]. Reduced ARSB activity in
association with increased chondroitin 4-sulfation has been implicated in aberrant cell signaling
and transcriptional events in mammalian cells [15-18].

glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparin and heparan sulfate [19,20]. Recent studies have implicated
these GAGs in viral attachment of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein to
the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in mammalian cells [21-23]. A galectin-like
fold has been identified in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, resembling
similar structures in other coronaviruses [24-28]. The presence of this fold suggests potential
binding with cell-based galactosides, such as those of chondroitin sulfates, which are the
preferred binding partners of galectins.
The studies presented in this report demonstrate several findings that are pertinent to
mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to respiratory insufficiency due to effects
of chondroitin sulfates and their associated proteoglycans. These effects do not preclude binding
interactions between heparin or heparan sulfate and the spike glycoprotein, but suggest potential
for cell membrane attachment by other spike protein-chondroitin sulfate interactions. In addition,

on Covid-19 disease is considered. Decline in ARSB has been associated previously with
increased mRNA and protein expression of Interleukin-6, a known mediator of cytokine storm in
Covid-19 infection [29,30]. The proposed mechanisms involving chondroitin sulfotransferases,
chondroitin sulfates, and ARSB, may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of Covid-19
infection, and attention to these pathways may help to design new approaches to reduce d
morbidity and mortality.

Materials and Methods
Human cell samples
Human aortic smooth muscle cells (Lifeline Technology, Oceanside, CA, USA) were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged twice, then grown in multiwell culture plates to
75% confluency, and media was changed to DMEM without serum for 24 h to maintain
quiescence. Cells were then treated with Angiotensin II (Ang II; 1 μM for 24 h; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), candesartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb; 10 μM for 24h; Sigma-Aldrich),
or their combination for 24 h, harvested and frozen for further experiments.
Circulating leukocytes were isolated from whole blood samples obtained from patients
aged 2-17, followed at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) for cystic fibrosis, asthma, or
other conditions under a protocol approved by RUMC and the University of Illinois at Chicago
(UIC) Institutional Review Boards [29]. Patients 8 years of age and older signed assent forms,
and parents of all subjects signed consent forms, permitting collection of peripheral blood
samples. Control subjects were children with a known, non-respiratory, underlying diagnosis or
children with no known illness. Venous blood was collected in citrated tubes and processed within
2 h of collection. Subjects had no acute illness at the time of blood collection. Blood samples were
identified with a study number, and a registry linked patient clinical data with study identifier.
Polymorphonuclear (PMN) and mononuclear (MC; monocytes and lymphocytes) white blood cells
were collected separately from the whole blood samples by the Polymorphprep TM kit (AXISSHIELD, Oslo, Norway) [29]. Cells were stored at -80°C until further experiments.
Measurement of arylsulfatase B activity
ARSB activity was measured in the leukocyte samples using a fluorometric assay,
following a standard protocol with 20 μl of homogenate in ddH2O and 80 μl of assay buffer (0.05M
Na-acetate buffer with 20mmol barium acetate /l Na-acetate, pH 5.6) with 100 μl of substrate
[5mM 4-methylumbelliferone sulfate (MUS) in assay buffer]. Materials were combined in

microplate wells, and the microplate was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped
by adding 150 μl of stop buffer (glycine–carbonate buffer, pH 10.7). Fluorescence was measured
at 360 nm (excitation) and 465 nm (emission). ARSB activity was expressed as nmol/mg
protein/h. and was derived from a standard curve prepared with known quantities of 4methylumbelliferone at pH 5.6 [31,32].
Measurement of Interleukin-6 by ELISA
Interleukin (IL)-6 in the patient plasma samples was measured by the Quantikine ELISA
kit for human IL-6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), as previously [29]. IL-6 in the samples was
captured into the wells of a microtiter plate pre-coated with specific anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody,
and the immobilized IL-6 was detected by a biotinylated second antibody and streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate with the chromogenic substrate hydrogen peroxide/
tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). Color intensity was read at 450 nm with a reference filter of 570 nm
in an ELISA plate reader (FLUOstar, BMG LABTECH, Inc., Cary, NC). IL-6 concentrations were
extrapolated from a standard curve plotted using known concentrations of IL-6, expressed as
picograms per milliliter plasma (pg/ml).
QRT-PCR for sulfotransferases and proteoglycans
QRT-PCR was performed using established techniques and primers identified using
Primer 3 software [33,34]. Primers were:
CHST11 human (NM_018413) Forward: 5’-GTTGGCAGAAGAAGCAGAGG-3’ and Reverse: 5’GACATAGAGGAGGGCAAGGA-3’;

Relative expression was calculated by standard methods comparing treated and control
cells using GAPDH as housekeeping gene [15].
Measurement of total sulfated glycosaminoglycans and sulfotransferase activity
Measurement of total sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was performed as previously
described [17]. Briefly, the BlyscanTM assay kit (Biocolor Ltd, Newtownabbey, N. Ireland) was
used for detection of the sulfated GAG, based on the reaction of 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue with
the sulfated oligosaccharides in the GAG chains.
Sulfotransferase activity was determined using the Universal Sulfotransferase Activity kit
(R&D, Minneapolis, MN), which assesses the sulfotransferase activity of all the sulfotransferases
in the cells or tissue tested [17]. 3′-Phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) is the sulfate
donor for the sulfotransferase reaction, and PAPS (10 μl, 1 mM), acceptor substrate (10 μl), and
coupling phosphatase (3.5 μl, 100 ng/μl) were combined with 25 μl/well of the cell suspension in
the wells of a microtiter plate. For negative controls, assay buffer was substituted for the cell
suspension. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at 37°C, then 30 μl of malachite green was
added and the mixture gently tapped. De-ionized water (100 μl) was added to each well, color
was developed, and the optical density of each well was read and compared among the different

wells. The amount of product formation was calculated using a phosphate standard curve,
following subtraction of the negative control. The 3-inorganic phosphate released by the coupling
phosphatase and detected by malachite green phosphate detection reagent, was proportional to
the 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate generated, thereby indicating the extent of the
sulfotransferase reaction which utilized the sulfate group of PAPS.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using InStat software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) or Excel
spreadsheet software by unpaired t-tests, two-tailed, with adjustment for equal or unequal
standard deviation, or by one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post-test. For control and AngII
treatments, 9-15 biological samples were tested, with technical replicates of each determination.
Plasma IL-6 determinations were performed with duplicate samples, using the average of two
determinations. Spearman correlation coefficients was calculated using Instat. Box and whisker
representation indicates mean value by “X”, median by a line in the box, 25% and 75% quartiles
by box margins, minimum and maximum by lines extending from the box (whiskers), and outliers
by points beyond the whiskers. P-values < 0.05 are considered statistically significant. Values are
compared to untreated control and *** or ### represents p<0.001, ** or ## indicates p<0.01, and *
or # indicates p<0.05. Study data of cultured aortic smooth muscle cells have not been reported
previously. Patient data from peripheral blood leukocytes and serum were reported previously in
a different format [29].

Results
Angiotensin II exposure increases mRNA expression of CHST11 and CHST15
Treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cells with Angiotensin (Ang) II led to marked
increases in mRNA expression of CHST15 and CHST11. CHST15 increased to 3.1 ± 0.2 times
the baseline level (p<0.001; n=9; unpaired t-test, two-tailed). Co-treatment with candesartan, an
angiotensin (Ang)-II receptor blocker (Arb), did not completely inhibit the Ang II-induced increases
in expression of CHST15. The difference between control and Ang II+Arb remained significant
(p<0.001; n=6; unpaired t-test, two-tailed) (Fig.1A,1B). CHST11 mRNA expression increased to
2.4 ± 0.2 times the baseline level (p<0.001; n=15; unpaired t-test, two-tailed). The Ang II-induced
increase was not completely inhibited by candesartan, and the difference between control and
Ang II+Arb remained significant (p<0.001; n=6; unpaired t-test, two-tailed) (Fig.1C,1D).
Consistent with the effects of Ang II on CHST11 and CHST 15 expression, the total
sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) increased (p<0.001; n=9; unpaired t-test, two-tailed). The
increase was not completely inhibited by Arb treatment, and the difference between control and
Ang II+Arb remained significant (p=0.048; n=3; unpaired t-test, two-tailed) (Fig.2A,2B). The
measured sulfotransferase activity was also significantly increased following Ang II (p<0.001; n=9;
unpaired t-test, two-tailed). The increase was largely inhibited by treatment with candesartan, but
the difference between control and following treatment by Ang II+Arb remained significant
(p=0.002, n=3; unpaired t-test, two-tailed) (Fig.2C,2D).
Increased expression of chondroitin sulfate-associated proteoglycans
Following treatment with Ang II, mRNA expression of several proteoglycans which may
have chondroitin sulfate attachments increased. These include increases from untreated control
values for versican, syndecan-1, biglycan, and perlecan (p<0.001, n=6) (Fig.3A). In contrast to
these increases, there was no increased expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)4,
tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST)1, or arylsulfatase B (ARSB) following Ang II exposure
(data not shown). Treatment with candesartan largely inhibited the increases in expression of

these proteoglycans, but the differences between control and Ang II + Arb remained significant
(Fig.3B).
Increase in IL-6 in association with decline in ARSB
In plasma from patients with cystic fibrosis or asthma, Interleukin-6 values were
significantly greater in the plasma from the patients with cystic fibrosis and in patients with asthma,
in contrast to the controls (p<0.001) (Fig.4A) [29]. Also, neutrophil Arylsulfatase B activity in CF
and asthma was less compared to levels in neutrophils from healthy normal controls (p<0.001)
(Fig.4B) [29]. An overall inverse relationship between ARSB and IL-6 in the control subjects and
subjects with asthma or cystic fibrosis is apparent (Spearman r = -0.69) (Fig.4C).
Overall schematic showing the potential impact of increase in sulfotransferases and of decline in
chondroitin sulfatases in the pathophysiology of Covid-19
An overall representation of the proposed interactions between spike protein receptor
binding with the ACE2 receptor indicates increased expression of CHST11 and CHST15 (Fig. 5).
Increases in these sulfotransferases leads to increased C4S and CSE production, which
accumulate and lead to hypoxia (↓pO2) and decline in ARSB activity. Decline in ARSB leads to
increased expression of IL-6, thereby contributing to cytokine storm. When ARSB is reduced, the
degradation of chondroitin sulfates is inhibited, further exacerbating effects of increased
chondroitin sulfotransferase expression and chondroitin sulfate production initiated by ACE2
stimulation.

Discussion
In the human aortic smooth muscle cells, exposure to Angiotensin (Ang) II markedly
increased the mRNA expression of the chondroitin sulfotransferases CHST11 and CHST15.
Sulfotransferase activity and total sulfated glycosaminoglycans, as well as the proteoglycans
versican, perlecan, biglycan, and syndecan were also increased. Expression of TPST1, a
tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)4, and arylsulfatase B
was not increased. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (Arb) candesartan incompletely inhibited
these increases, and increases remained significant. Since Ang II endogenously interacts with
both the Ang II receptor (AT1) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the findings
suggest either incomplete blockade of Ang II by candesartan or an additional effect of Ang II,
perhaps mediated by interaction with ACE2. We propose consideration of effects mediated by
ACE2, since these may be relevant to underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology.
Interactions between heparin and heparan sulfate and the receptor binding domain (RBD)
of the spike glycoprotein do not preclude additional effects of chondroitin sulfates and
proteoglycans in the pathophysiology of Covid-19 [19-23]. Identification of a galectin-like fold in
the spike glycoprotein suggests that additional interactions with β-galactosides may contribute to
binding of SARS-CoV-2 to cell surfaces [24-28]. Clausen et al reported that in A375 cells in which
ACE2 was overexpressed, knockout of B4GALT7 (beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 7), a gene
required for proteoglycan and GAG assembly, reduced the binding of the spike glycoprotein [21].
This finding reflects a crucial role of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans in adherence of
SARS-CoV-2 to human cells.
As in the mucopolysaccharidoses and in cystic fibrosis, accumulation of chondroitin
sulfates in the lung is anticipated to impair airflow and oxygenation [11-13,32]. Prior work has
shown a requirement of oxygen for post-translational modification and activation of arylsulfatase
B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) [30,35]. Refractoriness to benefit of supplemental
oxygen was demonstrated in patients with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who

had mutations limiting ARSB expression [36]. In other studies, decline in ARSB increased IL-6
expression in bronchial epithelial cells [30], and plasma IL-6 was increased in patients with cystic
fibrosis and asthma (Fig.4) [29]. The observed increases in CHST11 and CHST15 are anticipated
to lead to increased C4S and CSE production, and these chondroitin sulfates are anticipated to
accumulate further when ARSB activity is reduced. Increased chondroitin sulfate production by
bronchial epithelial cells, leading to airway obstruction and reduced oxygenation, which lead to
reduced ARSB activity and impaired degradation of chondroitin sulfates, may contribute to an
ongoing cycle in Covid-19 culminating in refractory respiratory insufficiency (Fig.5).
In the future, it will be informative to develop these findings in bronchial epithelial cells and
to quantify changes in chondroitin 4-sulfate, chondroitin sulfate E and total chondroitin sulfates.
Ideally, these measurements should follow exposure of the BEC to spike glycoprotein or a
modified coronavirus. At this time, we lack specific measurements of C4S, CSE, and ARSB
activity in bronchial epithelial cells following Ang II or activation of ACE2 by the spike glycoprotein.
Although lacking this information, the current findings suggest into how Covid-10 infection might
evolve in a self-perpetuating cycle due to effects on chondroitin sulfotransferases and chondroitin
sulfates and ARSB. The manifestations of lower ARSB may include: a) impact on viral binding to
respiratory tract cells by the galectin-like fold of the spike glycoprotein when chondroitin sulfates
are increased; b) impaired responsiveness to oxygen treatment; and c) enhanced IL-6 production
contributing to cytokine storm. Recombinant human (rh) ARSB is used for replacement in
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI), the inherited genetic deficiency of ARSB [11], and rhARSB
may be a useful, new approach to refractory hypoxia in Covid-19 patients.

Figure Legends
Fig.1. Increased Expression of CHST11 and CHST15 following AngII Exposure
a. Following exposure to Ang II (1 μM x 24h), mRNA expression of CHST15 increased to 3.1 ±
0.2 times the baseline level (n=9, p<0.001, unpaired t-test, 2-tailed). Box and whisker
representation indicates mean value by “X”, median by a line in the box, 25% and 75% quartiles
by box margins, minimum and maximum by lines extending from the box (whiskers), and outliers
by points beyond the whiskers.
b. Treatment with the Ang II receptor blocker candesartan (10 μM x 24h) nearly completely
blocked the Ang II-induced increase in CHST15 mRNA expression, but the difference between
control and Ang II+Arb was still highly significant (n=6, p<0.001, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).
c. Following exposure to Ang II (1 μM x 24h), mRNA expression of CHST11 increased to 2.4 ±
0.2 times the baseline level (n=15, p<0.001, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).
d. Treatment with the Ang II receptor blocker candesartan (10 μM x 24h) nearly completely
blocked the Ang II-induced increase in CHST11 mRNA expression, but the difference between

Fig.2. Sulfotransferase Activity and Total Sulfated Glycosaminoglycans
a. Consistent with the increases in sulfotransferase activity and the increased expression of
CHST11 and CHST15, the total sulfated glycosaminoglycans increased from 18.6 ± 1.1 μg/mg
protein to 24.9 ± 1.5 μg/mg protein in the vascular smooth muscle cells following treatment by
Ang II (p<0.001, n=9, unpaired t-test, two-tailed). Box and whisker representation indicates mean
value by “X”, median by a line in the box, 25% and 75% quartiles by box margins, minimum and

b. When treated with candesartan and Ang II, the peak total sulfated glycosaminoglycans declined
by 4.8 μg/mg protein to 20.1 ± 0.7 μg/mg protein, reflecting an overall increase of 1.5 μg/ml. The
difference between control value and post-treatment with Ang II and Arb remained statistically
significant (p=0.048, n=3, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).
c. Sulfotransferase activity increased to 184 ± 9% over the control level following Ang II (p<0.001,
n=9, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).
d. Sulfotransferase activity declined to 116 ± 7% of the control level when cells were treated with
an Arb and Ang II. The difference between control value and post-treatment with Ang II and Arb
remained significant (p=0.002, n=3, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).

a. Plasma Interleukin (IL)-6 levels were markedly increased in cystic fibrosis (n=17) compared to
the normal controls (65.3 ± 6.2 pg/ml vs. 5.3 ± 0.5 pg/ml; n=10; p<0.001). Levels in patients with
asthma (17.8 ± 6.1 pg/ml; n=10) were also significantly increased [29].

b. ARSB activity in the circulating neutrophils was markedly reduced in the cystic fibrosis patients
(n=17), compared to the normal controls (n=10) (51.9 ± 7.2 vs. 76.2 ± 6.3 nmol/mg protein/h) and
the patients with asthma (n=10) (67.8 ± 10.2 nmol/mg protein/h) [29].
c. There is an inverse relationship between plasma IL-6 levels and neutrophil ARSB activity
(Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.69).

Fig. 5. Schematic of Proposed Overall Pathway
The overall pathway proposes that transcriptional events arise following stimulation of the
ACE2 receptor lead to increased expression of CHST11 and CHST15. Increased sulfotransferase
expression lead to increased production of C4S and CSE. CSE is converted to C4S by GALNS
(N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase),

producing

C4S.

The

accumulation

of

sulfated

glycosaminoglycans in the airways impairs oxygenation (↓O2), inhibiting the post-translational
modification and activity of ARSB, leading to further accumulation of C4S, thereby aggravating
respiratory insufficiency. Decline in ARSB also leads to increased expression of IL-6, which
contributes to cytokine storm.
