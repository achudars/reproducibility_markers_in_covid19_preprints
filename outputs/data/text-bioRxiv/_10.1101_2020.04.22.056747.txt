ABSTRACT

2

The final months of 2019 witnessed the emergence of a novel coronavirus in the human population.

3

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and

4

is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely

5

and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method

6

available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently

7

become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed.

8

The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits

9

from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical,

10

PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene).

11

We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95% limit of detection

12

(LOD95%). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n=16) for a

13

preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-

14

coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n=6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses

15

to evaluate assay specificity.

16

PCR efficiency was ≥96% for all assays and the estimated LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range. Using

17

clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the

18

assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the

19

SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

20

We conclude that all RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-

21

19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.

INTRODUCTION

25

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

26

2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus emerged in the human population in the final months of 2019 from a, so far

27

unidentified, animal reservoir and has since spread across the globe (1). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic

28

poses an enormous burden on society, economic and healthcare systems worldwide, and various

29

measures are being taken to control its spread. Many of these measures critically depend on the timely

30

and accurate diagnosis of virus-infected individuals. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain

31

reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific assay and therefore preferred (2, 3). Whereas

32

many COVID-19 RT-PCR kits are currently commercially available, an independent assessment of these

33

products is not yet publicly available and direly needed to guide implementation of accurate tests in

34

a diagnostic market that is flooded with new tests. As of 11 April 2020, the FIND organization listed

35

201 molecular assays on their website as being on the market (www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline).

36

Coronaviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses that express their replication and

37

transcription complex, including their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), from a single, large

38

open reading frame referred to as ORF1ab (4). The coronavirus structural proteins, including the

39

envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and spike (S) proteins, are expressed via the production of subgenomic

40

messenger RNAs, which during certain stages of the replication cycle far outnumber (anti)genomic

41

RNAs. The ORF1ab/RdRp, E, N, and S genes are the targets most frequently used for SARS-CoV-2

42

detection by RT-PCR. For example, the “Corman” PCR, which was co-developed in our lab and is now

43

routinely used for our in-house diagnostic work, targets a combination of the E-gene and the RdRp-

44

gene (2). In this set-up, the E-gene primer/probe set is specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses,

45

and therefore detects both SARS-CoV-1 and -2. In addition, whereas the RdRp-gene primers are also

46

specific for bat(-related) betacoronaviruses, two probes are used: one specific for bat(-related)

47

betacoronaviruses and another specific for SARS-CoV-2. In this study we only used the RdRp probe

48

that is specific for SARS-CoV-2.

49

Here, we provide a comparison of a selection of seven readily available COVID-19 RT-PCR kits from

50

different manufacturers (Table 1). One of these kits (BGI) was recently also included in a comparative

51

study of various SARS-CoV-2 primer/probe sets (5). Most of the selected kits are CE-IVD certified and

52

can be produced in large quantities. Using a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 RNA we determine the 95%

53

limit of detection (LOD95%) for each of these assays. In addition, a concise panel of clinical samples

54

(n=22) was run to provide a first indication of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Although some kits

55

appeared to perform better than others at identifying clinical samples at very low concentrations of

56

SARS-CoV-2 RNA, all tests were able to identify positive samples with Ct≤34.5 in our in-house E-gene

57

PCR. Therefore, we conclude that all of the RT-PCR kits assessed in this study may be used for routine

58

diagnostics of COVID-19 by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories.

59

METHODS

60

Selection of kits

61

Commercially available COVID-19 RT-PCR kits were identified via the FindDx website

62

(www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline, March 2020) and requests for information and sample kits were

63

sent via e-mail to approximately 20 manufacturers and/or distributors, focusing on those kits that had

64

already obtained CE-IVD certification. Promising commercial kits were selected based on: 1) listing on

65

the FindDx website; 2) responsiveness to requests; 3) accessible information (in English); 4)

66

compatibility with different PCR platforms; 5) considerable production capacity. Notably, all of the

67

PCR kits that we had selected for our analysis have in the meantime also been selected for the first

68

round of independent evaluation by FIND (www.finddx.org/covid-19/sarscov2-eval-molecular/, April

69

2020). All of the kits included in our analysis were provided free of charge and none of the

70

manufacturers were involved in the assessment and interpretation of the results. The selection

71

encompasses

72

-20°C and kits that can be transported and stored at room temperature. Target genes for each RT-PCR

73

kit were available in the assay documentation or upon request (for an overview, see Table 1). All PCRs

74

were run on a LightCycler 480 II (LC480II, Roche) and performed according to the manufacturer’s

75

instructions for use. Of note however, for some kits (BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene) settings for the

76

LC480II were not provided and were therefore adapted from those provided for another machine.

77

PCR efficiency and limit of detection

78

To establish PCR efficiency we first ran a duplicate 10-fold dilution series of viral RNA for each assay.

79

Viral

80

19/Netherlands/Diemen_1363454/2020, GISAID: EPI_ISL_413570) obtained from cell culture using

81

the MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche). We determined the slope by linear

82

regression in GraphPad Prism and defined the required levels for PCR efficiency (E) and R2 as >95%

83

and >0.95, respectively. Next, we ran four replicates of a 2-fold dilution series (diluted in yeast carrier

84

RNA in water) to determine the LOD95% by Probit analysis using SPSS Statistics (IBM, version 24). The

85

limited range of the dilution series did not allow for determination of a confidence interval for the

86

LOD95% for all assays, which should therefore be regarded as an approximation and not considered

87

definitive. The starting concentration of the viral RNA (copies/ml) was determined by digital PCR

88

targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-gene and was specific for the positive sense genomic RNA (2).

89

Clinical sensitivity and specificity

90

Finally, a panel of clinical samples with in-house confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (17.25≤Ct≤39.6 for the E-gene

91

during initial diagnostics; n=16) or other respiratory viruses (influenza virus type A (n=2), rhinovirus

92

(n=2), RSV-A and -B) was prepared (for Ct values obtained in initial diagnostics, see supplementary

93

Table S1). RNA was isolated anew from stored clinical samples (naso- and/or oropharyngeal swabs in

94

GLY-medium) using the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Small Volume Kit (Roche) and was assessed

95

with a single replicate to obtain a first indication of clinical specificity and sensitivity. No re-test was

96

performed when the result was inconclusive according to the manufacturer’s instructions for

97

interpretation of the result (n=2). In addition to clinical samples, a panel of viral RNA from related cell

98

cultured human coronaviruses (including SARS1, MERS, NL63, OC43, and 229E) was used to assess

cross-reactivity within the coronavirus family (for Ct values of these samples see supplementary Table

100

S1).

101

RESULTS

102

PCR efficiency was above the required level for all kits included in the study. We first assessed PCR

103

efficiency for each target gene assay by running a duplicate 10-fold dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 viral

104

RNA (Figure 1). All assays showed an efficiency ≥96% and R squares were ˃0.97, which are both well

105

above the pre-defined required level. Since the applied filter settings were not correct for reading the

106

Seegene N-gene assay, we excluded these data from all of our analyses.

107

The LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range between the kits included in the study. The 10-fold dilution

108

series provided a first indication of the LOD95% for each assay and were used to determine the starting

109

point of a 2-fold dilution series performed with four replicates to come to a more precise estimate (for

110

Ct values, see supplementary Table S2). Probit analysis was performed to estimate the LOD95%, which

111

is shown in Table 2. Notably, due to the limited extent of the dilution series, this analysis did not always

112

provide upper and lower bounds of the estimate and should not be considered definitive. We found

113

that the estimated LOD95% for the various targets of the RT-PCR kits varied within a 6-fold range, with

114

the RT-PCR kit from Altona Diagnostics having the lowest LOD95% at 3.8 copies/ml for both the E- and

115

S-gene assays and the PrimerDesign kit having the highest LOD95% at 23 copies/ml (Table 2). Overall,

116

our in-house “Corman” RT-PCR had the lowest estimated LOD95% at 0.91 copies/ml for the E-gene

117

assay (2).

118

The clinical sensitivity appears to vary between the kits included in the study. Next, we analyzed a

119

panel of clinical samples previously submitted for routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics (n=16) for which the

120

presence of various amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA had been confirmed using our in-house PCR. In

121

addition, we included a panel of clinical samples (n=6) with other confirmed respiratory viral

122

infections, including influenza virus type A, RSV A and B, and rhinovirus. Notably, the new RNA

123

isolation performed on stored clinical samples resulted in increased Ct values (by approximately 1 Ct)

124

compared to the initial diagnostic results for our in-house E-gene PCR. For this reason, even using our

125

in-house PCR we could not confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 3 out of 16 samples (see Figure

126

2A and supplementary Table S1). The positive identification rate for the various RT-PCR kits varied

127

from 10 to 13 out of 16 samples (Figure 2A), with R-Biopharm AG performing best (13/16), followed

128

by BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene (12/16), CerTest BioTec (11/16), and Altona Diagnostics and

129

PrimerDesign (10/16). Of note, Seegene had one “inconclusive” sample according to the

130

manufacturer’s instructions for interpretation, which might have tested positive upon re-testing but

131

has now been counted as “negative”. All target gene assays were able to positively identify the 10

132

clinical samples with the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 (Ct≤34.50 in our in-house E-gene PCR).

133

For these samples, the different assays showed a similar pattern of Ct values, on average ranging from

134

almost 1 Ct lower (Altona Diagnostics S-gene) to almost 5 Ct higher (KH Medical S-gene) than those

135

obtained with the in-house E-gene PCR (Figure 2B).

136

None of the assays showed cross-reactivity with circulating respiratory (corona)viruses. Importantly,

137

none of the assays resulted in a positive signal for any of the clinical samples with confirmed non-

138

coronavirus respiratory viral infections (Supplementary Table S1). We also ran a panel consisting of

139

cell culture-derived viral RNA for related human coronaviruses (SARS1, MERS, NL63, OC43, and 229E)

140

to check for cross-reactivity within the coronavirus family. Of these, only the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene was

141

identified, as per design, by assays from Altona Diagnostics, Seegene, and our in-house PCR

142

(Supplementary Table S1).

143

DISCUSSION

144

Here we provide a comparison of seven commercially available RT-PCR kits for the detection of SARS-

145

CoV-2 in clinical samples. All RT-PCR kits performed satisfactorily regarding PCR efficiency (≥96%) and

146

the estimated LOD95% varied within a 6-fold range between kits (3.8-23 copies/ml). Notably, the copy

147

number concentration of the standard was determined by digital PCR on the positive sense RdRp gene

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.22.056747; this version posted April 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

148

and therefore provides an indication of the number of viral particles per ml. The actual copy number

149

for each RT-PCR target and accompanying limit of detection may vary depending on, for example, the

150

amount of subgenomic messenger RNA-containing cells that are present in the (clinical) sample.

151

From a selection of clinical samples with various concentrations of viral RNA, all RT-PCR kits were able

152

to positively identify the ten samples with the highest concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Ct≤34.5 in

153

our in-house E-gene PCR). To provide an indication on clinical relevance of this finding: from our in-

154

house diagnostic data on patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms, it appears that from all

155

individuals testing positive for our in-house E-gene PCR (n=416) the proportion of individuals with a

156

Ct value >34.5 is approximately 3.6% (unpublished data). The R-Biopharm AG kit positively identified

157

the highest number of clinical samples, i.e. 13 out of 16, comparable with our in-house PCR. Three kits

158

were able to positively identify 12 out of 16 samples (BGI, KH Medical, Seegene). Notably, we

159

performed our analysis using only a small number of clinical samples and we therefore advise that

160

diagnostic laboratories in the field conduct additional and more extensive in-house clinical validations

161

upon implementation of novel RT-PCR kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity

162

towards a panel of other respiratory (corona)viruses, except for the expected cross-reactivity with the

163

SARS-CoV-1 E-gene. Since the latter virus is no longer known to be circulating in the human population,

164

we consider this cross-reactivity acceptable.

165

Considering our findings, we believe that all of the commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this

166

study can be used for routine diagnostics of symptomatic COVID-19 patients. When performing virus

167

diagnostics in populations that may be expected to display low viral loads, such as health-care workers

168

with mild or no symptoms or patients during later stages of the infection (6), it might be advisable to

169

use those kits that performed best regarding the positive identification of clinical samples, i.e. RT-PCR

170

kits from R-Biopharm AG, BGI, KH Medical, and Seegene.

The copy number was determined by digital PCR for the positive sense RdRp gene. Due to the limited range of the 2-fold
dilution series, a confidence interval could not be determined for all assays.
2The filter settings for the Seegene N-gene PCR were not correct and these results are therefore excluded.
