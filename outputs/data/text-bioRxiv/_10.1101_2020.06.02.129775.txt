Abstract
The proliferation of the SARS-Cov-2 virus to the whole world caused more
than 250,000 deaths worldwide and over 4 million conﬁrmed cases. The severity
of Covid-19, the exponential rate at which the virus proliferates, and the rapid
exhaustion of the public health resources are critical factors. The RT-PCR with
virus DNA identiﬁcation is still the benchmark Covid-19 diagnosis method. In
this work we propose a new technique for representing DNA sequences: they are
divided into smaller sequences with overlap in a pseudo-convolutional approach,
and represented by co-occurrence matrices. This technique analyzes the DNA
sequences obtained by the RT-PCR method, eliminating sequence alignment.

Through the proposed method, it is possible to identify virus sequences from a
large database: 347,363 virus DNA sequences from 24 virus families and SARSCov-2. Experiments with all 24 virus families and SARS-Cov-2 (multi-class
scenario) resulted 0.822222 ± 0.05613 for sensitivity and 0.99974 ± 0.00001 for
speciﬁcity using Random Forests with 100 trees and 30% overlap. When we
compared SARS-Cov-2 with similar-symptoms virus families, we got 0.97059 ±
0.03387 for sensitivity, and 0.99187 ± 0.00046 for speciﬁcity with MLP classiﬁer
and 30% overlap. In the real test scenario, in which SARS-Cov-2 is compared
to Coronaviridae and healthy human DNA sequences, we got 0.98824 ± 001198
for sensitivity and 0.99860 ± 0.00020 for speciﬁcity with MLP and 50% overlap.
Therefore, the molecular diagnosis of Covid-19 can be optimized by combining
RT-PCR and our pseudo-convolutional method to identify SARS-Cov-2 DNA
sequences faster with higher speciﬁcity and sensitivity.

1. Introduction
At the end of 2019, the proliferation of the SARS-Cov-2 virus appeared
in the city of Wuhan, China (Zhou et al., 2020). In a few months, there are
more than 250,000 deaths worldwide and over 4 million conﬁrmed cases (WHO,
5

2020b). Covid-19, as it became known, is a respiratory syndrome. In moderate
cases, it manifests clinically as pneumonia. In critical cases, a disease can lead
to respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction (MOD)
or failure (MOF) (Cascella et al., 2020; Peeri et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a).
Besides the severity of the disease, the exponential rate at which the virus

10

proliferates is an aggravating factor. The transmission of the virus often occurs through asymptomatic people. The contagion is given by drops or secretions from sneezing or coughing (Cascella et al., 2020). Because of this, many
countries have been experiencing overcrowding in their hospital centers. Most
medical professionals are working long hours, and the number of pulmonary ven-

tilators is not enough for all patients. This scenario has led dozens of countries
to adopt measures of social isolation. They attempt to contain the dissemination, and to mitigate the number of people who need hospitalization (Hellewell
et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith & Freedman, 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020).
In response to this growing pandemic, several companies and research cen-

20

ters worldwide have researched and developed methods for diagnosing Covid-19
(Wang et al., 2020b). Among them, rapid tests emerged, which can provide
results in about 30 minutes. One type of rapid test is the Rapid Diagnostic Test
(RDT). Through samples from the patient’s respiratory tract, RDT seeks to
detect the presence of antigens. Antigens are substances that are foreign to the

25

body, causing immune responses. These responses produce speciﬁc antibodies,
capable of binding to and interacting with the antigen, ensuring the protection
of the organism. Thus, in tests of the RDT type, antibodies are ﬁxed on paper
tapes and placed in plastic capsules, similar to the well-known pregnancy tests.
If the target antigen is present in the patient’s sample at certain concentrations,

30

it will attach to the antibodies on the tape, generating a visual signal. Unfortunately, this method has some restrictions. First, it is only possible to detect
in the acute stages of infection, when antigens are expressed. In addition, efﬁciency depends on factors such as quality and the collection protocol and the
formulation of reagents. We must also emphasize that the possibility of false

35

positives, when the antibodies present on the tape recognize antigens from other
types of viruses. For these reasons, the sensitivity of the RDT can vary from 34
to 80% (Bruning et al., 2017; WHO, 2020a).
Another type of rapid test is based on host antibody detection. In this case,
antibodies are detected in the patient’s blood samples, depending on factors

40

such as age, nutrition, disease severity and medications. However, recent studies
have shown that the immune response is very weak, late or even absent in many
cases of patients conﬁrmed with Covid-19 (Döhla et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020;
Burog et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Pan et al.,
2020). This means that this type of detection is often only possible in cases of

45

recovered patients. The study (Long et al., 2020) reports 285 patients who tested

positive for IgG. However, these immune responses were seen 19 days after the
ﬁrst symptoms. This condition makes testing ineﬀective in many situations, as
opportunities for treatment and clinical interventions no longer exist. Therefore,
WHO does not currently recommend these types of rapid diagnostic tests for
50

Covid-19. The suggestion is to use them in research contexts or as a way of
screening patients, or of potential diagnosis (WHO, 2020a).
Therefore, the benchmark for Covid-19 diagnosis is molecular diagnosis or
RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identiﬁcation (Patel et al., 2020; Tahamtan
& Ardebili, 2020). Throat swab samples are usually collected from suspected

55

patients in this type of analysis. The samples are then placed in tubes with
virus preservation solutions, where the genetic material of the virus can be
extracted. In this case, the single-stranded RNA. In the ﬁrst phase, reverse
transcription occurs, where a complementary DNA molecule (cDNA) to the
virus RNA is synthesized. This process takes place through the DNA polymerase

60

enzyme. The RNA is then removed, and the Taq DNA polymerase enzyme
produces double-stranded DNA, which is a copy of the virus’s RNA. Then, the
PCR exponentially ampliﬁes fragments of this DNA during successive cycles,
generating millions of copies to be analyzed. In the following, the cDNA is
aligned with sequences from the SARS-Cov2 virus. Sequence alignment is a

65

traditional method for analyzing similarity between sequences. Among the most
consolidated methods are BLAST and FASTA. If there is a match between both
sequences, then the patient is conﬁrmed positive. Otherwise, the patient is
considered negative for Covid-19 (Bosco & Di Gangi, 2016; Rizzo et al., 2015;
Zhang & Harmon, 2020; Chan et al., 2020).

70

Although so far RT-PCR with DNA identiﬁcation is considered the most accurate and eﬀective method, there are still some weaknesses. A major limitation
of the sequence alignment methods is the computational complexity and time
consumption. In many cases, patients can take days to receive the diagnosis
due to sample preparation and genomic analysis. Because of this, several stud-

75

ies have proposed alignment free methods for genomic sequences classiﬁcation.
Most of these methodologies involve a feature extraction method such as spec4

tral representation of DNA sequences. Thus, the representative attributes of
the sequence can be combined with methods of artiﬁcial intelligence, especially
machine learning. This makes possible to separate each analyzed sequence into a
80

class (Covid-19 positive or Covid-19 negative, for example) (Bosco & Di Gangi,
2016; Rizzo et al., 2015).
In this work we propose a new technique for representing sequences based
on the analysis of the relationships between nitrogenous bases. This technique
analyzes the DNA sequences obtained by the RT-PCR method, eliminating the

85

alignment process. The idea is as follows: a DNA sequence is divided into n
smaller sequences. Each subsequence i is superimposed with a part of the subsequence i−1 and with a part of the subsequence i+1, giving rise to two new subsequences. These smaller sequences are represented by co-occurrence matrices.
The matrices are square with 4x4 dimensions, with number of rows and columns

90

corresponding to each of the nitrogenous bases of DNA (Adenine, Cytosine,
Thymine, and Guanine). The co-occurrence matrix considers the occurrence of
each of the bases, as well as the relationship between bases and their immediate neighbors. Then, the co-occurrence matrices are stacked together, forming
a volume. Considering that the sequences can be subdivided into smaller and

95

smaller subsets, with the formation of new co-occurrence matrices, the proposed
method has a pseudo-convolutional aspect from the algorithmic point of view.
After obtaining the set of matrices, they are then concatenated, forming attribute vectors. These extracted attributes correspond to a high-level vectorial
representation of the initial DNA sequence, independent from the size of the

100

sequence. This feature vector can be classiﬁed by machine learning techniques.
Through the proposed method, it is possible to identify virus sequences from
a relatively large database. Several advantages can be pointed out with this
approach: First, it is not necessary to pre-align the sequence under investigation
in relation to the reference sequences; Second, the sequence under study is

105

compared with a wide set of sequences of given classes, and not just with a
reference sequence, strengthening the reliability of the test. We also emphasize
that the method can be applied to sequences of any size.

The present work seeks to describe and test the new method of feature
extraction to represent sequences of nitrogenous bases. Our main objective is
110

to optimize the RT-PCR, the benchmark for Covid-19 diagnosis. To reach this
goal, we used genomic sequences of diﬀerent viruses obtained in the repository
VIPR (Virus Pathogen Resource) Pickett et al. (2012). We used 24 virus families
with more than 500 sequences each, including the SARS-Cov2 family. Each
sequence was submitted to the representation process described here. In the

methods. (method) presented a superior performance, considering four metrics
(accuracy, kappa index, sensibility and speciﬁcity).
This work is organized as following: in section 2 we present a brief of the
state-of-the-art of DNA methods; in section 3 we present our methodology,

120

including our proposal, the description of the database, the experiments parameters and the metrics used for performance measure. In section 4 we provide our
experiments results and make analysis of them; ﬁnally, in section 6 we summarized the scientiﬁc contribution of this work and discusses the potential future

2. Related works
Several studies have sought to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through
the provision of rapid tests. The most common methods are based on the use of
antibodies. Li et al. (2020) proposed a simple and rapid test for the combined
detection of IgG and IgM antibodies. Both antibodies are indicative of infection.

130

However, immunoglobulins M provide an immediate response to viral infections,
and it can be detected in a period of 3 to 6 after infection. Immunoglobulin G,
on the other hand, is important for the body’s long-term immunity or immune
memory. With this in mind, they developed a test capable of detecting IgM
and IgG simultaneously in blood samples, allowing detection in a longer time

135

window. For the development of the rapid test, the authors collected samples
from eight diﬀerent laboratories and hospitals in China, with a total of 397

patient samples positive for Covid-19, and 128 negative samples. These results
were conﬁrmed by the RT-PCR technique using a respiratory tract specimen.
Blood samples from patients were pipetted into the test kit, followed by two or
140

three drops of dilution buﬀer. After 15 minutes it was possible to analyze the
result using three markers. The ﬁrst marker (letter C) or line on the display
appears red when the sample is negative. The presence of IgG and IgM is
indicated by red or pink lines in the regions with the letters M and G in the kit,
and both antibodies may be present in the sample. The tone of the line is also

145

indicative of the level of concentration of each type of antibody. Among the
samples analyzed, the tests showed 88.66% sensitivity and 90.63% speciﬁcity.
These values can be considered high, in comparison with results obtained in
other studies (Cassaniti et al., 2020). The work also tested the performance
of the method in 10 patients using peripheral blood. The results remained

150

reliable. Thus, the work is promising and points out an interesting path for a
simple and quick diagnosis, which can be an alternative for extensive testing of
the population. However, the study does not point to tests with other types
of viruses similar to SARS-Cov2, such as common ﬂu. Given the similarity
between viruses, the tests may indicate false positives, where the antibodies

155

bind to similar antigens to SARS-Cov2.
Unlike rapid tests based on the detection of antigens, other works have sought
to incorporate computational intelligence techniques in the diagnosis of Covid19. Many of them have invested in automatic classiﬁcation based on x-ray images making use of Deep Learning techniques, especially CNNs (Apostolopoulos

160

& Mpesiana, 2020; Narin et al., 2020; Sethy & Behera, 2020). Apostolopoulos
et al. (2020) applied these techniques to distinguish Covid-19 from other lung
diseases, such as viral and bacterial pneumonias, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, chronic obstructive disease, and pulmonary ﬁbrosis. This study used
a wide database with 3905 x-ray images, including approximately 450 cases of

165

Covid-19. For model training, the images were scaled to 200x200 pixels. Small
variations of the images were also considered. That is, the images were slightly
rotated, in order to make the model robust to variations in position and orienta7

tion that may occur in the image acquisition process. To extract characteristics
from the images, some models of convolutional networks (CNN) of the Mobile
170

Net type were tested. Three techniques were compared: development of a new
CNN architecture; application of a pre-trained CNN (Transfer Learning); and a
hybrid method, which applies tuning strategies to speciﬁc layers of a pre-trained
CNN. The experiments were carried out in Python, using the Keras library and
TensorFlow as a backend. Among the tested conﬁgurations, the CNN devel-

175

oped from scratch showed the best results, suggesting that biomarkers related
to Covid-19 can be found with the technique. The model achieved an average
rating accuracy of 87.66%, considering all six classes. With special regard to
Covid-19, the model achieved 99.18% accuracy, 97.36% sensitivity, and 99.42%
speciﬁcity.

180

Gomes et al. (2020) also proposed the use of machine learning techniques for
classiﬁcation of x-ray images, distinguishing between Covid-19, viral pneumonia,
bacterial pneumonia and healthy patients. In contrast to the previous work,
the authors invested in low-cost computational methods. Thus, the authors
tested Haralick and Zernike moments for extracting attributes and used classic

185

classiﬁers, such as MLP, SVM, decision trees and Bayesian networks. The work
points out that the chosen extractors can play an important role in the diagnosis
by image. The reason for this is that in clinical practices it is common to ﬁnd
opaque and whitish areas in contexts of pneumonia. Finally, SVM reached the
best performance. The authors reached an average accuracy of 89.78%, average

190

recall and sensitivity of 0.8979, and average precision and speciﬁcity of 0.8985
and 0.9963 respectively. An initial desktop version of the system was developed
and made available for free non-commercial use on Github.
On the other hand, other studies have invested in Covid-19 diagnostic methods through intelligent systems based on blood tests. Methods like this can be

195

useful mainly in contexts of unavailable rapid tests, functioning as a patient
screening process. For the development of the this work, Soares et al. (2020)
used a database made available by the Israeli Hospital Albert Einstein, located
in São Paulo, Brazil. The database has 108 clinical exams and data from 5644

patients. The authors chose 599 patients, who had few missing data (at least 16
200

tests performed). Among them, 81 had a positive result for Covid-19 by the RTPCR method. In addition, they selected tests that can be performed quickly in
an emergency context. The selected blood tests were complete blood count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, C-reactive protein, in addition to the patient’s age.
Considering the imbalance of the database, the work used SMOTE techniques

205

(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) (Chawla et al., 2002; Lusa et al.,
2013), which is capable of generating synthetic data from the minority class.
Then they trained 10 support vector machines (SVM). The initial prediction
model corresponds to the average probability of the 10 models developed. The
testing and training processes were performed 100 times, using diﬀerent subsets,

210

with a 90% percentage split for training and 10% for testing. All models and
statistics were obtained using R. The authors achieved an average speciﬁcity of
85.98%, an average sensitivity of 70.25%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of
94.92%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 44.96%. For the last metric,
the authors believe that severe cases, however negative for Covid-19, generated

215

more confusion in the classiﬁcation. Another study Barbosa et al. (2020), using
the same initial database, applied attribute extraction methods (Particle Swarm
Optimization) to search for the best tests among the 108 initial ones. Then, the
authors manually selected exams in order to reduce costs. The result was 24
selected exams, with performance similar to the initial base. The results of the

220

evaluation metrics were: 95.16% of average accuracy, sensitivity of 0.969, speciﬁcity of 0.936 and 0.903 of kappa index. The authors made a desktop version
of the system available for free non-commercial use.
While rapid diagnostic methods are important and optimize this process,
the gold standard and recommendation of WHO is still the RT-PCR method

225

with DNA sequencing (WHO, 2020a), similar to the method developed for the
diagnosis of SARS-Cov (Chan et al., 2004; Emery et al., 2004; Corman et al.,
2012). Thereby, multiple studies and protocols for identifying SARS-Cov2 by
molecular diagnosis have already been published (Corman et al., 2020b,a; Poon
et al., 2020; Chu et al., 2020; Nao et al., 2020). Chu et al. (2020) developed

RT-PCR assays to detect SARS-Cov2 in human clinical samples. The authors
relied on the ﬁrst publication of the virus sequence on Genbank, in addition to
sequences of other types of coronavirus to perform the alignment. Thus, they
designed two monoplex assays, which target the ORF1b and N gene regions.
Then, these primer and probe sequences were conﬁrmed with other released

235

SARS-Cov2 sequences. RT-PCR reactions were performed by a thermal cycler,
using typical reaction mixture, forward and reverse primers, probe, and RNA
sample. RNA and DNA puriﬁcation kits were also used for extraction. The time
for each RT-PCR run was about 1h and 15 min. In order to determine assays
speciﬁcity, they used negative control samples with RNA extracted from other

240

viruses (MERS, camel coronavirus, inﬂuenza A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus,
rhinovirus, etc.) and from healthy patients. In contrast, all viruses belonging to
the Sarbecovirus subgenus (SARS-like coronaviruses, and other coronaviruses)
were considered positive in these assays. This decision was made due to the
small amount of data available from SARS-Cov2 at the time of the development

245

of the work. The study tested the method on two patients with suspected
SARS-Cov2 infection. The samples were taken from diﬀerent locations (sputum
vs. throat swab) and at diﬀerent infection periods (day 5 vs. day 3). Both
patients received a positive result. Finally, the study results demonstrated the
clinical value of respiratory samples for molecular diagnosis of Covid-19. The

250

authors also observed a high sensitivity of the N gene for detecting the disease,
being recommended as a screening assay, and the Orfb1 as a conﬁrmatory one.
The biggest diﬃculty, however, is that RT-PCR is time-consuming and labour
intensive, and consequently, its result can take days to be available (Ai et al.,
2020). This makes clinical conduct diﬃcult and favors the contamination of

255

more people by SARS-Cov2. In this sense, the objective of this work is to
propose an optimization of the gold standard method.

3. Materials and methods
3.1. Proposed method
Our work considers genome sequences of several virus types, where each
260

sequence is organized into a single matrix. Initially, the genome sequence is
divided into n subsequences, which will then be overlapped with its neighbors.
In the overlapping process, a parameter received by the method determines the
size of the superimposed pieces. Every subsequence i is combined with a piece
of the subsequence immediately to its left i − 1, and also with a piece of the

265

one to its right, i + 1. An exception is made for the ﬁrst and last sequence of
the matrix, given that they have only one subsequence from which to take a
piece. This procedure results in two new sequences for each of the subsequences
generated from the original genome.
After that, these smaller sequences are represented by co-occurrence matri-

270

ces. The matrices are square with 4x4 dimensions. Each element of the matrix
represents the number of occurrences of a given pair of nucleotide bases, as
well as the relationship between bases and their immediate neighbors. These
elements are AA, AC, AT, AG, CA, CC, CT, CG, TA, TC, TT, TG, GA, GC,
GT, and GG. The matrix is then normalized, where its maximum value is used

275

to divide each of its elements.
Finally, all the 4 × 4 matrices are stacked together, forming a volume 4x4xm,
wherein m is the number of subsequences resultant from the overlapping process.
In general terms:
m = (n − 1) × 2

(1)

After obtaining this set of matrices, they are then concatenated, forming
attribute vectors. These extracted attributes correspond to a high-level vectorial
representation of the initial DNA sequence, independent from its size.
This process is illustrated in the following diagram in Figure 1.

3.2. Classiﬁers

Figure 1: Steps of the proposed method: a new technique for representing genome sequences
based on the analysis of the relationship between nitrogenous bases. It works as follows: the
complete genome sequence is subdivided into n folders. Each subsequence is combined with a
piece of its neighbors, generating two new sequences. These smaller sequences are represented
by co-occurrence matrices, considering the occurrence of each of the nitrogenous bases, and the
relationship between bases and their immediate neighbors. In the next step, theses matrices
are stacked together as a volume. Finally, this set in concatenated, forming attribute vectors,
which are a high-level vectorial representation of the original sequence.

This classiﬁer uses decision trees as its building blocks, Tin Kam Ho (1995).
Decision trees, as illustrated in Figure 2, iteratively separate data by testing a
property at a time, the resulting leafs representing the most speciﬁc category,
and the root representing the raw data. The Random Forest is constructed of
many such trees, that all have its own class prediction to any given input. The

290

class with the most votes is the Random Forest’s output.

Figure 2: This decision tree example illustrates the classiﬁcation of samples by two diﬀerent
features, colour and then shape.

As the characteristics that divide the genomes evaluated aren’t known, this
method is advantageous because it veriﬁes many possibly relevant properties.
Thus, it can test and locate diﬀerences in the genetic code in question.
3.2.2. Naive Bayes Classiﬁer
295

This machine learning model uses probability, speciﬁcally the Bayes theorem, Maron (1961). The Bayes Theorem deﬁnes the probability of an event
A happening, given that another event B has already taken place. The Bayes
Theorem can be expressed as:

P (A|B) =

P (B|A)P (A)
P (B)

(2)

It is called naive because it assumes independence in the features that lead
300

to the events. Furthermore, it assumes all predictors have an equal weight.
This approach is beneﬁcial because it explores the possibility that the genomes
have dividing properties that are not correlated. Should that be the case, this
classiﬁer might yield good results.
3.2.3. Instance Based Learner

305

This algorithm, also known as IBK, Altman (1992), doesn’t construct a
model, but instead predicts by using a distance k between samples in the training set and a test sample. The training set instances selected generate the
prediction, as demonstrated in Figure 3. It could prove to be successful, be-

cause it classiﬁes by ﬁnding similar instances. Thus, it might be able to identify
310

genome sequences that belong to the same virus.

Figure 3:

3.2.4. Multilayer Perceptron
This classiﬁer, shown in Figure 4, is a neural network capable of solving non
linear data problems, Minsky & Papert (1969). Each neuron unit has weights
that multiply the input, which is in turn processed by an activation function to
315

generate the output. The weights are adjusted until the network can satisfy a
certain accuracy in output. In this manner, it could identify the features that
are particular to each class.

3.2.5. Support Vector Machine
This algorithm, Cortes & Vapnik (1995), hopes to ﬁnd an optimal hyperplane
320

that can separate the data into classes, as exempliﬁed in Figure 5. The plane will
have n dimensions, according to the number of features. The support vectors
are the samples closest to the dividing hyperplane, that aid in its construction.
Thus, it could be used to classify the genomes by dividing them with such a
hyperplane.

vector machine has 2 dimensions.

3.3. Database
Twenty-ﬁve diﬀerent viruses were used to evaluate the eﬃciency of the feature extraction method, including the SARS-Cov2 Cleemput et al. (2020). Data
was obtained from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource
(ViPR) Pickett et al. (2012), which features multiple whole-genome sequences

330

(WGS) from several viruses. Table 1 displays the number of examples per virus
for each of the selected viruses.
The viruses have diﬀerent sample sizes, ranging from 42, as is the case for
Phasmaviridae, to 216,223, for Hepatitis C. The bar graphs below depict the
distribution of sample sizes in both a linear and a logarithmic scale.

The second dataset used in this paper is from the Genome Reference Consortium Consortium (2013). Its purpose was to represent the human genome,
and it has 103,959 samples.
3.4. Experiment setups
Various experiments were constructed to evaluate feature extraction method’s

340

quality. They aim to simulate diﬀerent use cases wherein SARS-CoV2 could
need to be identiﬁed. There is a multiclass experiment, a binary classiﬁcation,
classiﬁcation of viruses with similar symptoms and a real test scenario.

3.4.1. Multiclass Classiﬁcation
This experiment’s purpose is to diﬀerentiate SARS-CoV2 and the other
345

viruses listed in table 1 from each other. In it, all 25 classes of the table 1
were used to build the database, that was split in training set and test set. In
classes with more than 500 instances, the training set consisted of 500 them,
and the rest were used in testing. The classes with less than a 500 samples had
70% of their samples allocated for training and 30% for testing. Additionally,

350

the feature extraction hyperparameter n was set to 4, and overlap was tested
at 30%, 50%, and 70%.
3.4.2. Binary Classiﬁcation
This test was utilized to analyze the proposed method’s eﬃciency in diﬀerentiating SARS-CoV2 from Coronaviridae. Viruses from the same family could

355

potentially be challenging to classify when compared because they have a more
similar genome. To account for that scenario, the two classes with their genomes
are contrasted only to each other. Train and test splitting was performed exactly as in the multiclass evaluation. The feature extraction hyperparameter
n was set to 4, and overlap was set to 30%, a percentage that was previously

360

shown to represent the virus genome sequences satisfactorily.
3.4.3. Viruses with similar symptoms
A third test was outlined to classify viruses with similar symptoms to SARSCoV2. This should prove useful in determining if a patient has symptoms that
indicate they might have SARS-CoV2, but other possibilities cannot be ruled

365

out. Four classes were established: SARS-CoV2; Coronaviridae; Paramyxoviridae; Peneumoviridae, Hantaviridae, Enterovirus, and Nairoviridae. The train
and test splits and the hyperparameter n were maintained as in previous tests.
Overlap was set to 30%, 50%, and 70%.
3.4.4. Real test scenario

370

This test included three classes: the human genome, from the Genome Reference Consortium Consortium (2013), SARS-CoV2 and the other viruses from

table 1. It tests the real use case of the proposed method, wherein SARS-CoV2
must be identiﬁed amongst both human genome and other viruses. The train
and test splitting was performed as previously established, and the value of n
375

remained the same. Furthermore, the overlap was also tested at 30%, 50%, and
70%.
3.5. Metrics
• Confusion Matrix
The confusion matrix provides a more straightforward structure for the

380

portrayal of the model’s output, wherein the rows represent its predictions,
and the columns represent the expected results. The confusion matrix
layout used to display the results is illustrated in the following table, and
its correct interpretation is as stated previously. Furthermore, n expresses
the total number of instances, and each row, when summed, amounts to

385

the total number of instances per class. The number of correctly classiﬁed
instances can be obtained by adding all the elements in the main diagonal.
On the other hand, the number of misclassiﬁed instances is obtained from
the opposite diagonal.
• Accuracy

390

The accuracy describes the rate of correct classiﬁcation of instances and
is the most commonly used metric in machine learning. Considering a
confusion matrix T = [ti,j ]n×n for a classiﬁcation task with n classes, in
which i denotes the index of the i-th true class and j points to the index
of the class associated to the classiﬁcation decision, the j-th class, the

395

accuracy is deﬁned as following:

and is thus calculated:

where TP is the number of true positives and FP is the amount of false
positives.

Recall measures the proportion of actual positives correctly classiﬁed by
the model. It is computed by:

Recall =

where FN is the number of false negatives.

The speciﬁcity, or True Negative Rate (TNR), if deﬁned as following:
TNR =

TN + FP

where TN is the number of true negatives.
• Area Under the ROC Curve
The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graph that plots
the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) of classiﬁ415

cation for diﬀerent thresholds. The FPR is deﬁned by:

FPR =

FP
.
FP + TN

(10)

Thus, the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) measures performance for
all possible thresholds of classiﬁcation in a given model, and therefore it
portrays the quality of results independently of it.

4. Results
420

4.1. Multiclass Classiﬁcation
In order to evaluate the eﬃciency of the proposed features extraction method,
this ﬁrst round of experiments was conducted in a more challenging scenario with
twenty-ﬁve diﬀerent viruses, including the SARS-CoV2. Five types of classiﬁers
were tested: IBk, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes classiﬁer (NBC),

425

Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). All experiments were
performed with Weka software. The parameters used in each machine learning
method is shown in Table 2.
Figure 6 shows the accuracy for all classiﬁers in the datasets with 30%, 50%,
and 70% of overlap, respectively. Considering this multiclass classiﬁcation, all

430

three datasets (with 30%, 50%, and 70% overlap) presented Random Forest
classiﬁer with the highest accuracies (approximately 94% in all the datasets).
Figure 7 shows box plots for the Kappa statistic. Since Kappa statistic
is less sensitive to the high imbalanced test dataset, it is a better evaluation

435

highest Kappa statistics compared with the other classiﬁers (above 0.88 in all
experiments).
Besides, accuracy and Kappa statistic, Figure 8 shows the weighted average
sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and ROC area for all datasets and classiﬁers. For the
weighted average sensitivity and ROC area, Random Forest results are higher

440

or equal to other classiﬁers. For the weighted average speciﬁcity, visual analysis
of Figure 8-b suggests that the IBK classiﬁer achieves higher scores on this
metric. However, all classiﬁers, except Naive Bayes Classiﬁer, achieved results

above 0.99 on weighted average speciﬁcity, so the Random Forest is presented
as a robust classiﬁer for this task.
445

Aiming to evaluate the overlap percentage in the feature extraction method,
Figure 9 shows box plots for accuracy, Kappa statistic, weighted average precision, recall and ROC area for the Random Forest classiﬁer in the datasets with
30%, 50%, and 70% overlap percentages. The variance of accuracy and kappa
in the dataset with 30% overlap is higher than in the 50% and 70% overlap

450

dataset. However, 30% overlap seems to be slightly better (or at least at the
same level) as the others overlap percentages.
Because of class unbalancing in the test dataset, we need to evaluate sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and ROC area for each class individually. Considering the
Random Forest classiﬁer in the dataset with 30% overlap, Table 3 shows the

455

results of sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and ROC area individually for each virus in
the database. Speciﬁcity and ROC Area results are above 0.9 for every virus.
The sensitivity varies from 0.99391 for Pneumoviridae to 0.23397 for Filoriviridae. However, for most of the classes, sensitivity has values greater than 0.8
(including SARS-Cov2 class with a sensitivity of 0.82).

460

In order to perform a visual analysis of these results, Figure 10 shows the

average confusion matrix for the Random Forest classiﬁer in the dataset with
30% overlap. The confusion matrix is expressed in terms of percentage for the
particular class, and the classes indexes numbers are the same as shown in Table
3. We can see that for some classes, there is a confusion with another virus. For
465

example, most of the Picornaviridae virus (index 0) is classiﬁed as Enterovirus
(index 14). This confusion is not symmetrical: Picornaviridae is misclassiﬁed as
Enterovirus, but Enterovirus is not misclassiﬁed as Picornaviridae. The only exception for this observation of confusion with another virus type is the Phasma
Viridae (index 23), which is confused with two other viruses: Hantaviridae (in-

470

dex 9), and Peribunyaviridae (index 21). However, since there are few examples
of Phasma Viridae in the dataset (only 42 examples), those results may be

caused by the low representative of this class in the dataset.

Figure 10: Random Forest average Confusion Matrix (results from dataset with 30% overlap).

Regarding the SARS-Cov2 virus (index 24), the only relevant confusion is
with Coronaviridae (index 17). It is a predictable outcome since SARS-Cov2
475

belongs to the Coronaviridae virus family. 3.1% of Coronaviridae examples
are classiﬁed as SARS-Cov2 (the only confusion noticed in column 24 of the
confusion matrix). A more signiﬁcant confusion is noticed between SARS-Cov2
and Coronaviridae since 11% of SARS-Cov2 are misclassiﬁed as Coronaviridae.
Since the ROC area for SARS-Cov2 is 0.99883 (Table 3), we performed a

480

threshold adjustment for SARS-Cov2 class in order to reach 100% sensitivity.
The new average confusion matrix is shown in Figure 11. Higher false positives

for SARS-Cov2 remains from Coronaviridae (5,1% - index 17). In the sequence
of false positive rates, we have: Hepatitis C virus (3,47% - index 20), Reoviridae
(3,19% - index 22), and Phasma Viridae (2,68% index 23).

4.2. Binary Classiﬁcation
Given that, in the multiclass scenario, the highest false positives for SARSCov2 are from Coronaviridae, we evaluated the same classiﬁers used in the
multiclass scenario for a binary classiﬁcation between Coronavirus and SARSCov2. For this experiment, only the dataset with 30% overlap was used, since

490

this overlap percentage has shown to represent the virus genome sequences satisfactorily.
Figure 12 shows the accuracy, kappa statistic, weighted average sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, and ROC area for each classiﬁer. It is important to state that there is
still a relevant imbalance between the number of Coronaviridae and SARS-Cov2

495

examples in the dataset (3256 and 171, respectively). So, the Kappa statistic
is still more appropriate than accuracy to assess the classiﬁer’s overall performance. Regarding Kappa statistics, weighted average speciﬁcity, and ROC area,
MLP results are higher or equal to other classiﬁers. For the weighted average
sensitivity, SVM achieves higher results than MLP. Nevertheless, given that av-

500

erage sensitivity for MLP is higher than 0.96 and MLP overcomes SVM in all
other metrics, MLP seems to be a more robust classiﬁer for this particular task.
Table 4 shows the sensitivity, speciﬁcity and ROC Area for each class. It is
possible to notice that each one of those metrics has values above 0.96. Figure 13
shows the average Confusion Matrix for MLP classiﬁer. There was no relevant

505

diﬀerence with the multiclass scenario regarding the confusion between Coronaviridae and SARS-Cov2 since there is still a 3.85% of Coronaviridae examples
misclassiﬁed as SARS-Cov2. However, about the confusion between SARS-Cov2
and Coronaviridae, the binary MLP classiﬁer achieved 2.61% of confusion while
11% in the multiclass scenario.

ﬁers used previously were evaluated in this classiﬁcation task.
Figures 14 and 15 shows the accuracy and kappa for all classiﬁers and
datasets in this classiﬁcation task. Except for the Naive Bayesian classiﬁer,
classiﬁers have similar performance metrics, with approximately 97% accuracy
and kappa equal to 0.96. Figure 16 shows the weighted average speciﬁcity

520

and sensitivity and ROC are. The weighted average sensitivity and speciﬁcity
look very similar to all classiﬁers (except Naive Bayes Classiﬁer). However, the
weighted average ROC area for MLP and Random Forest classiﬁers is slightly
higher than the other classiﬁers, although IBK and SVM classiﬁers also achieve
a weighted average ROC area above 0.98 in all datasets.

525

In order to better evaluate the MLP and Random Classiﬁer, Figure 17 shows
the confusion matrices for those classiﬁers in all datasets. The Random Forest
presents a confusion between the SARS-Cov2 and the Coronaviridae of approximately 10%. It is very similar to the achieved results in the multiclass scenario.
However, the MLP classiﬁer achieves signiﬁcantly low-level confusions between

530

SARS-Cov2 and Coronaviridae (1.57% in the datasets with 30% and 50% overlap). The main confusion found in the MLP classiﬁer is between Conronarividae
and SARS-Cov2 (3.81% for the dataset with 30% overlap). By MLP confusion
matrix analysis is not possible to ﬁnd signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the 30%,
50%, or 70% overlap percentages. Since the 30% overlap requires less compu-

In this scenario, the SARS-Cov2 test is designed as a three-class classiﬁcation
problem: SARS-Cov2 (the test target), GRCh38 (the healthy human reference),

and Coronaviridae (a virus control sample). The same classiﬁes used in the other
experiments were applied to this new task.

5. Discussion
Regarding the feature extraction methods, it seems to capture the structure
of the viruses’ genome sequence. Random Forest classiﬁer achieved the best
overall performance for multiclass scenarios, while MLP classiﬁer presented the
570

best results for scenarios with fewer classes.
Evaluating the parameters for the feature extraction proposed method, splitting the viruses’ genome sequence into four folders (n = 4) seems to be enough
to produce representative features. Regarding the overlap percentage, the proposed feature extraction method is not very sensitive to this parameter, even

575

though 30% to 50% seems to be enough to produce good features representations.
The ﬁrst multiclass scenario (with 25 viruses classes) is an extreme case
scenario. Nevertheless, the Random Forest classiﬁer achieved sensitivity and
speciﬁcity above 0.9 for many classes. For those classes with lower sensitiv-

580

ity, the confusion matrix shows that most confusions are particular between
two viruses. For example, Filoriviridae is the class with a lower sensitivity rate
(0.23). However, checking the confusion matrix, on average, 76.27% of Filoriviridae are misclassiﬁed as Ebola Virus. There is no other signiﬁcant confusion for
Filoriviridae, so it is possible to design a classiﬁer cascade to solve this speciﬁc

585

confusion between two viruses.
One particular virus class is the Pharma Viridae since it has only 42 samples
in the dataset (30 used for training and 12 for testing). Even with this small
amount of samples in the multiclass scenario, the signiﬁcant misclassiﬁcations
for Pharma Viridae are Henteraviridae (22.78%), and Peribunyavirida (35.26%).

590

With a larger sample size for the Pharma Viridae, classiﬁers could ﬁnd a better
boundary decision reducing this level of false-negative rate. However, for this
particular class, three-classes cascade classiﬁers could be evaluated to deal with
these types of errors.
Regardless of the feature extraction parameters or even the used classiﬁer,

595

there is still a 3-4% of Coronaviridae samples misclassiﬁed as SARS-Cov2. How-

ever, this is an expected outcome, since SARS-Cov2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family. Visualizing the extracted features, we found some samples of SARSCov2 and Coronaviridae that can not be distinguished, as showed in Figure 22.
So, it is tough for any classiﬁer to separate those two classes optimally.

6. Conclusion
In this work we presented a novel method to represent DNA sequences by
using pseudo-convolutions and co-occurrence matrices. With this method, we
were able to represent hundreds of thousands of DNA sequences from 24 virus
families. Then we separated SARS-Cov-2 sequences from the Coronaviridae

605

family and demonstrated that our model is able to diﬀerentiate all virus families
present on our database. SARS-Cov-2 was discriminated from virus families
other than Coronaviridade and even from other coronaviruses with very high
sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
We aimed to show the capabilities of optimizing the molecular diagnosis of

610

Covid-19 by combining RT-PCR, the actual ground-truth Covid-19 diagnostic
method, and our pseudo-convolutional method to identify SARS-Cov-2 DNA
sequences faster.
From the obtained results, we can assume that the proposed pseudo-convolutional approach is able to characterize SARS-Cov-2 DNA sequences. This new

representation of DNA sequences can be successfully used as a feature extraction
stage to full connected networks, in order to use the deep learning philosophy,
or other classical classiﬁcation architectures. The evaluation of the proposed
approach in real test scenarios, necessarily reduced to a limited set of virus
families and healthy human sample DNA, showed high sensitivity (higher than

620

0.988) and speciﬁcity (higher than 0.998) rate as well. Hence, other researchers
can use our solution and our methods to improve their results to diagnose Covid19 faster with accuracies even higher than the state-of-the-art methods.
