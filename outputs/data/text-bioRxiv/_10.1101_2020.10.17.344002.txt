Summary (150 words)
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes widespread damage in the lungs in the setting of an
overzealous immune response whose origin remains unclear. We present a scalable, propagable, personalized,
cost-effective adult stem cell-derived human lung organoid model that is complete with both proximal and distal
airway epithelia. Monolayers derived from adult lung organoids (ALOs), primary airway cells, or hiPSC-derived
alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes were infected with SARS-CoV-2 to create in vitro lung models of COVID-19.
Infected ALO-monolayers best recapitulated the transcriptomic signatures in diverse cohorts of COVID-19
patient-derived respiratory samples. The airway (proximal) cells were critical for sustained viral infection,
whereas distal alveolar differentiation (AT2→AT1) was critical for mounting the overzealous host immune
response in fatal disease; ALO monolayers with well-mixed proximodistal airway components recapitulated both.
Findings validate a human lung model of COVID-19 , which can be immediately utilized to investigate COVID19 pathogenesis and vet new therapies and vaccines.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, causes widespread inflammation and injury in the lungs,
giving rise to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) 1-5, featuring marked infection and viral burden leading to apoptosis
of alveolar pneumocytes 6, along with pulmonary edema

7,8.

DAD leads to poor gas exchange and, ultimately,

respiratory failure; the latter appears to be the final common mechanism of death in most patients with severe
COVID-19 infection. How the virus causes so much damage remains unclear. A particular challenge is to
understand the out-of-control immune reaction to the SARS-CoV-2 infection known as a cytokine storm, which
has been implicated in many of the deaths from COVID-19. Although rapidly developed pre-clinical animal
models have recapitulated some of the pathognomonic aspects of infection, e.g., induction of disease, and
transmission, and even viral shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract, many failed to develop severe
clinical symptoms 9. Thus, the need for pre-clinical models remains both urgent and unmet.
To address this need, several groups have attempted to develop human pre-clinical COVID-19 lung
models, all within the last few months 10-12. While a head-to-head comparison of the key characteristics of each
model can be found in Table 1, what is particularly noteworthy is that none recapitulate the heterogeneous
epithelial cellularity of both proximal and distal airways, i.e., airway epithelia, basal cells, secretory club cells and
alveolar pneumocytes. Also noteworthy is that models derived from iPSCs lack propagability and/or cannot be
reproducibly generated for biobanking; nor can they be scaled up in cost-effective ways for use in drug screens.
Besides the approaches described so far, there are a few more approaches used for modeling COVID-19—(i)
3D organoids from bronchospheres and tracheospheres have been established before 13-15 and are now used in
apical-out cultures for infection with SARS-COV-2 16; (ii) the most common model used for drug screening is the
air-liquid interphase (ALI model) in which pseudo-stratified primary bronchial or small airway epithelial cells are
used to recreate the multilayered mucociliary epithelium 17,18; (iii) several groups have also generated 3D airway
models from iPSCs or tissue-resident stem cells

19-24;

(iv) others have generated AT2 cells from iPSCs using

closely overlapping protocols of sequential differentiation starting with definitive endoderm, anterior foregut
endoderm, and distal alveolar expression

25-30.

(v) Finally, long term in vitro culture conditions for pseudo-

stratified airway epithelium organoids, derived from healthy and diseased adult humans suitable to assess virus
infectivity

31-33

have been pioneered; unfortunately, these airway organoids expressed virtually no lung

mesenchyme or alveolar signature. What remains unclear is if any of these models accurately recapitulate the
immunopathologic phenotype that is seen in the lungs in COVID-19.
We present a rigorous transdisciplinary approach that systematically assesses an adult lung organoid
model that is propagable, personalized and complete with both proximal airway and distal alveolar cell types
against existing models that are incomplete, and we cross-validate them all against COVID-19 patient-derived
respiratory samples. Findings surprisingly show that cellular crosstalk between both proximal and distal
components are necessary to emulate how SARS-CoV-2 causes diffuse alveolar pneumocyte damage; the
proximal airway mounts a sustained viral infection, but it is the distal alveolar pneumocytes that mount the
overzealous host response that has been implicated in a fatal disease.

Results
A rationalized approach for creating and validating acute lung injury in COVID-19
To determine which cell types in the lungs might be most readily infected, we began by analyzing a human lung
single-cell sequencing dataset (GSE132914) for the levels of expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-II
(ACE2) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the two receptors that have been shown to be the
primary sites of entry for the SARS-CoV-2

34.

The dataset was queried with widely accepted markers of all the

major cell types (see Table 2). Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2), ciliated and club cells emerged as the cells with
the highest expression of both receptors (Fig. 1A; Fig. S1A). These observations are consistent with published
studies demonstrating that ACE2 is indeed expressed highest in AT2 and ciliated cells

11,35,36.

In a cohort of

deceased COVID-19 patients, we observed by H&E (Fig. S1B) that gas-exchanging flattened AT1 pneumocytes
are virtually replaced by cuboidal cells that were subsequently confirmed to be AT2-like cells via
immunofluorescent staining with the AT2-specific marker, surfactant protein-C (SFTPC; Fig. 1B upper panel;
Fig. S1C; top). We also confirmed that club cells express ACE2 (Fig. S1C; bottom), underscoring the importance
of preserving these cells in any ideal lung model of COVID-19. When we analyzed the lungs of deceased COVID19 patients, the presence of SARS-COV-2 in alveolar pneumocytes was also confirmed, as determined by the
colocalization of viral nucleocapsid protein with SFTPC (Fig. 1B; lower panel; Fig. S1D). Immunohistochemistry
studies further showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 virus in alveolar pneumocytes and in alveolar immune
cells (Fig. S1E). These findings are consistent with the gathering consensus that alveolar pneumocytes support
the interaction between the epithelial cells and inflammatory cells recruited to the lung; via mechanisms that
remain unclear, they are generally believed to contribute to the development of acute lung injury and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the severe hypoxemic respiratory failure during COVID-19 37,38. Because
prior work has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in patient-derived airway cells is highest in the proximal
airway epithelium compared to the distal alveolar pneumocytes (AT1 and AT2)

37,

and yet, it is the AT2

pneumocytes that harbor the virus, and the AT1 pneumocytes that are ultimately destroyed during diffuse
alveolar damage, we hypothesized that both proximal airway and distal (alveolar pneumocyte) components might
play distinct roles in the respiratory system to mount the so-called viral infectivity and host immune response
phases of the clinical symptoms observed in COVID-19 39.
Because no existing lung model provides such proximodistal cellular representation (Table 1), and
hence, may not recapitulate with accuracy the clinical phases of COVID-19, we first sought to develop a lung
model that is complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia using adult stem cells that were isolated
from deep lung biopsies. Lung organoids were generated using the protocol outlined in Fig 1C and detailed in
Methods. Organoids grown in 3D cultures were subsequently dissociated into single cells to create 2Dmonolayers (either maintained submerged in media or used in ALI model) for SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed
by RNA Seq analysis. Primary airway epithelial cells and hiPSC-derived alveolar type-II (AT2) pneumocytes
were used as additional models (Fig. 1D; left panel). Each of these transcriptomic datasets was subsequently
used to cross-validate our ex-vivo lung models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the human COVID-19 autopsy lung

specimens (Fig. 1D; right panel) to objectively vet each model for their ability to accurately recapitulate the gene
expression signatures in the patient-derived lungs.

Creation of a lung organoid model, complete with both proximal and distal airway epithelia
Three lung organoid lines were developed from deep lung biopsies obtained from the normal regions of lung
lobes surgically resected for lung cancer; both genders, smokers and non-smokers were represented (Fig. S2A;
Table 3). Three different types of media were compared (Fig. S2B); the composition of these media was inspired
either by their ability to support adult-stem cell-derived mixed epithelial cellularity in other organs (like the
gastrointestinal tract
components

or rationalized based on published growth conditions for proximal and distal airway

A growth condition that included conditioned media from L-WRN cells which express Wnt3,

R-spondin and Noggin, supplemented with recombinant growth factors, which we named as ‘lung organoid
expansion media’ emerged as superior compared to alveolosphere media-I and II27,28 (details in the methods),
based on its ability to consistently and reproducibly support the best morphology and growth characteristics
across multiple attempts to isolate organoids from lung tissue samples. Three adult lung organoid lines (ALO13) were developed using the expansion media, monitored for their growth characteristics by brightfield
microscopy and cultured with similar phenotypes until P10 and beyond (Fig. S2C-D). The 3D morphology of the
lung organoid was also assessed by H&E staining of slices cut from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell
blocks of HistoGel-embedded ALO1-3 (Fig. S2E).

To determine if all the 6 major lung epithelial cells (illustrated in Fig. 2A) are present in the organoids, we
analyzed various cell-type markers by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2B-H). All three ALO lines had a comparable level of AT2
cell surfactant markers (compared against hiPSC-derived AT2 cells as positive control) and a significant amount
of AT1, as determined using the marker AQP5. ALOs also contained basal cells (as determined by the marker
ITGA6), ciliated cells (as determined by the marker FOXJ1), club cells (as determined by the marker SCGB1A1)
and stem cells (as determined by marker p75-NGFR). As expected, the primary human bronchial epithelial cells
(NHBE) had significantly higher expression of basal cell markers than the ALO lines (hence, served as a positive
control), but they lacked stemness and club cells (hence, served as a negative control).
The presence of all cell types was also confirmed by assessing protein expression of various cell types
within organoids grown in 3D cultures. Two different approaches were used—(i) slices cut from FFPE cell blocks
of HistoGel-embedded ALO lines (Fig. 2I-J) or (ii) ALO lines grown in 8-well chamber slides were fixed in matrigel

(Fig. 2K), stained, and assessed by confocal microscopy. Such staining not only confirmed the presence of all
cell types in each ALO line but also demonstrated the presence of more than one cell type (i.e., mixed cellularity)
of proximal (basal-KRT5) and distal (AT1/AT2 markers) within the same organoid structure. For example, AT2
and basal cells, marked by SFTPB and KRT5, respectively, were found in the same 3D-structure (Fig. 2J,
interrupted curved line). Similarly, ciliated cells and goblet cells stained by Ac-Tub and Muc5, respectively, were
found to coexist within the same structure (Fig. 2J, interrupted box; Fig. 2K, arrow). The presence of
heterogeneous cellularity was documented in all three ALO lines (see multiple additional examples in Fig. S3).

Organoid cellularity resembles tissue sources in 3D cultures but differentiates in 2D cultures
To model respiratory infections such as COVID-19, it is necessary for pathogens to be able to access the apical
surface. It is possible to microinject into the lumens of 3D organoids, as done previously with pathogens in the
case of gut organoids43-46, or FITC-dextran in the case of lung organoids47, or carry out infection in apical-out 3D
lung organoids with basal cells

12.

However, the majority of the researchers have gained apical access by

dissociating 3D organoids into single cells and plating them as 2D-monolayers 10,11,31,33,48-50. As in any epithelium,
the differentiation of airway epithelial cells relies upon dimensionality (apicobasal polarity); because the loss of
dimensionality can have a major impact on cellular proportions and impact disease-modeling in unpredictable
ways, we assessed the impact of the 3D-to-2D conversion on cellularity by RNA seq analyses. Two commonly
encountered methods of growth in 2D-monolayers were tested: (i) monolayers polarized on trans-well inserts
but submerged in growth media, and ii) monolayers were grown at the air-liquid interface (popularly known as
the ‘ALI model’

51,52

for 21-days to differentiate into the mucociliary epithelium (see Fig. 3A; Fig. S4A-E). The

submerged 2D-monolayers had several regions of organized vacuolated-appearing spots (Fig. S4A, D; arrow),
presumably due to morphogenesis and cellular organization even in 2D. The ALI-monolayers appeared to be
progressively hazier with time after air-lift, likely due to the accumulation of secreted mucin (Fig. S4E), and
formed an intact epithelial barrier, as determined by trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (Fig. S4C). RNA
Seq datasets were analyzed using the same set of cell markers, as we used in Fig. 1A (listed in Table 2). Celltype

of

our

dataset using

CIBERSORTx

(https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/runcibersortx.php) showed that cellular proportions in the human lung tissues
were also relatively well-preserved in organoids grown in 3D over several passages (Fig. 3B; left); both showed
a mixed population of simulated alveolar, basal, club, ciliated and goblet cells. When 3D organoids were
dissociated and plated as 2D monolayers on transwells, the AT2 signatures were virtually abolished with a
concomitant and prominent emergence of AT1 signatures, suggesting that growth in 2D-monolayers favor
differentiation of AT2 cells into AT1 cells

53(Fig.

3B; middle). A compensatory reduction in proportion was also

observed for the club, goblet and ciliated cells. The same organoids, when grown in long-term 2D culture
conditions in the ALI model, showed a strikingly opposite pattern; alveolar signatures were almost entirely
replaced by a concomitant increase in ciliated and goblet cells (Fig. 3B; right). These findings are consistent with
the well-established notion that ALI conditions favor growth as pseudo-stratified mucociliary epithelium51,52. As
an alternative model for use as monolayers for viral infection, we developed hiPSC-derived AT2 cells and
alveolospheres (Fig. 3C), using established protocols

49.

Because they were grown in the presence of

CHIR99021 (an aminopyrimidine derivate that is a selective and potent Wnt agonist)

27,28,54,

which probably

inhibits the AT2→AT1 differentiation, these monolayers were enriched for AT2 and devoid of AT1 cells (Fig. 3D).
The multicellularity of lung organoid monolayers was also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining
and confocal microscopy of the submerged and ALI monolayers, followed by the visualization of cell markers in
either max-projected z-stacks (Fig. 3E; left) or orthogonal views of the same (Fig. 3E; right). As expected,
markers for the same cell type (i.e., SFTPB and SFTPC, both AT2 markers) colocalize, but markers for different
cell types do not. Submerged monolayers showed the prominent presence of both AT1 (AQP5-positive) and AT2

cells. Compared to the submerged monolayers, the ALI model showed a significant increase in the ciliated
epithelium (as determined by Ac Tub; compare Ac Tub stained panels in Fig. 3E with 3F). This increase was
associated with a concomitant decrease in KRT5-stained basal cells (Fig. 3F). Such loss of the basal cell marker
KRT5 between submerged monolayers and the ALI model can be attributed to and the expected conversion of
basal cells to other cell types (i.e., ciliated cells)55,56.
Taken together, the immunofluorescence images are in agreement with the RNA seq dataset; both demonstrate
that the short-term submerged monolayer favors distal differentiation (AT2→AT1), whereas the 21-day ALI
model favors proximal mucociliary differentiation. It is noteworthy that these distinct differentiation phenotypes
originated from the same 3D-organoids despite the seeding of cells in the same basic media composition (i.e.,
PneumaCultTM) prior to switching over to an ALI-maintenance media for the prolonged growth at Air-Liquid
interface; the latter is a well-described methodology that promotes differentiation into ciliated and goblet cells 57.

Differentiated 2D-monolayers show that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is higher in proximal than distal epithelia
Because the lung organoids with complete proximodistal cellularity could be differentiated into either proximalpredominant monolayers in submerged short-term cultures or distal-predominant monolayers in long-term ALI
cultures, this provided us with an opportunity to model the respiratory tract and assess the impact of the virus
along the entire proximal-to-distal gradient. We first asked if ALO monolayers are permissive to SARS-CoV-2
infection and replication. Confocal imaging of infected ALO monolayers with anti-SARS-COV-2 nucleocapsid
protein antibody showed that submerged ALO monolayers did indeed show progressive changes during the 48
to 72h window after infection (Fig. 3G): by 48 hpi we observed the formation of ‘reticulovesicular patterns’ that
are indicative of viral replication within modified host endoplasmic reticulum
observed focal cytopathic effect (CPE)

59

58

(Fig. 3G; left), and by 72 hpi we

such as cell-rounding, detachment, and bursting of virions (Fig. 3G;

right, Fig. S5C).
We next asked how viral infectivity varies in the various lung models. Because multiple groups have
shown the importance of the ciliated airway cells for infectivity (i.e., viral entry, replication and apical release37,6062),

as positive controls, we infected monolayers of human airway epithelia (see Fig. S4F-I). AT2 cells, which

express high levels of viral entry receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1A) have been shown to be
proficient in viral entry, but are least amenable to sustained viral release and infectivity37,62. To this end, we
infected monolayers of hiPSC-derived homogeneous cultures of AT2 cells as secondary controls (see Fig. S4JL). Infection was carried out using the Washington strain of SARS-CoV-2, USA-WA1/2020 [BEI Resources NR52281

63].

As expected, the 2D-lung monolayers we generated, both the submerged or the ALI models, were

readily infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S5A), as determined by the presence of the viral envelope gene (Egene; Fig. 3H); however, the kinetics of viral amplification differed. When expressed as levels of E gene
normalized to the peak values in each model (Fig. 3H), the kinetics of the ALI-monolayer model mirrored that of
the primary airway epithelial monolayers; both showed slow beginning (0 – 48 hpi) followed by an exponential
increase in E gene levels from 48 to 72 hpi. The submerged monolayer model showed sustained viral infection
during the 48-72 hpi window (Fig. S5A; left). In the case of AT2 cells, the 48-72 hpi window was notably missing

in monolayers of hiPSC-derived AT2 cells (Fig. 3H; Fig. S5A; right). When we specifically analyzed the kinetics
of viral E gene expression during the late phase (48-72 hpi window), we found that proximal airway models
[human Bronchial airway Epi (HBEpC)] were more permissive than distal models [human Small Airway Epi
(HSAEpC) and AT2] to viral replication (Fig. S5B); the ALO monolayers showed intermediate sustained
infectivity (albeit with variability). All models showed extensive cell death and detachment by 96 hrs and, hence,
were not analyzed. Finally, using the E gene as a readout, we asked if ALO models could be used as platforms
for pre-clinical drug screens. As a proof-of-concept, we tested the efficacy of nucleoside analog N4hydroxycytidine (NHC; EIDD-parent) and its derivative pro-drug, EIDD-2801; both have been shown to inhibit
viral replication, in vitro and in SARS-CoV-2-challenged ferrets64,65. ALO monolayers plated in 384-wells were
pre-treated for 4 h with the compounds or DMSO (control) prior to infection and assessed at 48 hpi for the
abundance of E gene in the monolayers. Both compounds effectively reduced the viral titer in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3I), and the pro-drug derivative showed a better efficacy, as shown previously.
Taken together, these findings show that sustained viral infectivity is best simulated in monolayers that
resemble the proximal mucociliary epithelium, i.e., 2D-monolayers of lung organoids grown as ALI models and
the primary airway epithelia. Because prior studies conducted in patient-derived airway cells 37 mirrors what we
see in our monolayers, we conclude that proximal airway cells within our mixed-cellular model appear to be
sufficient to model viral infectivity in COVID-19. Findings also provide proof-of-concept that ALO monolayers
may serve as effective models for use in HTP therapeutic screen.

Differentiated 2D-monolayers show that host immune response is higher in distal than proximal epithelia
Next, we asked if the newly generated lung models accurately recapitulate the host immune response in COVID19. To this end, we analyzed the infected ALO monolayers (both the submerged and ALI variants) as well as the
airway epithelial (HSAEpC) and AT2 monolayers by RNA seq and compared them all against the transcriptome
profile of lungs from deceased COVID-19 patients. A publicly available dataset (GSE151764)

66,

comprised of

lung transcriptomes from victims deceased either due to non-infectious causes (controls) or due to COVID-19,
was first analyzed for differentially expressed genes (Fig. 4A-B). This cohort was chosen as a test cohort over
others because it was the largest one available at the time of this study with appropriate postmortem control
samples. Differentially expressed genes showed an immunophenotype that was consistent with what is expected
in viral infections (Fig. 4C; Table 4; Fig. S6), and showed overrepresentation of pathways such as interferon,
immune, and cytokine signaling (Fig. 4D; Table 5; Fig. S7). Differentially expressed gene signatures and
reactome pathways that were enriched in the test cohort were fairly representative of the host immune response
observed in patient-derived respiratory samples in multiple other validation cohorts; the signature derived from
the test cohort could consistently classify control (normal) samples from COVID-19-samples (ROC AUC 0.89 to
1.00 across the board; Fig. 4E). The most notable finding is that the patient-derived signature was able to
perfectly classify the EpCAM-sorted epithelial fractions from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of infected and
healthy subjects (ROC AUC 1.00; GSE145926-Epithelium

67,

suggesting that the respiratory epithelium is a

major site where the host immune response is detected in COVID-19. When compared to existing organoid

models of COVID-19, we found that the patient-derived COVID-19-lung signature was able to perfectly classify
infected vs. uninfected late passages (> 50) of hiPSC-derived AT1/2 monolayers (GSE155241)

48

and infected

vs. uninfected liver and pancreatic organoids (Fig. 4F). The COVID-19-lung signatures failed to classify
commonly used respiratory models, e.g., A549 cells and bronchial organoids, as well as intestinal organoids
(Fig. 4F). A similar analysis on our own lung models revealed that the COVID-19-lung signature was induced in
submerged monolayers with distal-predominant AT2→AT1 differentiation, but not in the proximal-predominant
ALI model (ROC AUC 1.00 and 0.50, respectively; Fig. 4G). The ALI model and the small airway epithelia, both
models that mimic the airway epithelia (and lack alveolar pneumocytes; see Fig. 3B), failed to mount the patientderived immune signatures (Fig. 4H; left). These findings suggested that the presence of alveolar pneumocytes
is critical for emulating host response. To our surprise, induction of the COVID-19-lung signature also failed in
hiPSC-derived AT2 monolayers (Fig.4H; right), indicating that AT2 cells are unlikely to be the source of such
host response. These findings indicate that both proximal airway and AT2 cells, when alone, are insufficient to
induce the host immune response that is encountered in the lungs of COVID-19 patient.
Next, we analyzed the datasets from our ALO monolayers for differentially expressed genes when
challenged with SARS-COV-2 (Fig. 5A-B). Genes and pathways upregulated in the infected lung organoidderived monolayer models overlapped significantly with those that were upregulated in the COVID-19 lung
signature (compare Fig. 4C-D with 5C-D, Table 6-7; Fig. S8-S9). That we observed a partial overlap in
upregulated genes and no overlaps among downregulated genes between model and disease (COVID-19) (Fig.
5E) likely reflects the missing stromal and immune components in our organoid monolayers. Regardless of these
missing components, the model-derived DEG signature was sufficient to consistently and accurately classify
diverse cohorts of patient-derived respiratory samples (ROC AUC ranging from 0.88 to 1.00; Fig. 5F); the modelderived DEG signature was significantly induced in COVID-19 samples compared to normal controls (Fig. 5GH). Most importantly, the model-derived DEG signature was significantly induced in the epithelial cells recovered
from bronchoalveolar lavage (Fig. 5I).
Taken together, these cross-validation studies from disease to model (Fig. 4) and vice versa (Fig. 5)
provide an objective assessment of the match between the host response in COVID-19 lungs and our submerged
ALO monolayers. Such a match was not seen in the case of the other models, e.g., the proximal airway-mimic
ALI model, HSAEpC monolayer, or hiPSC-derived AT2 models. Because the submerged ALO monolayers
contained both proximal airway epithelia (basal cells) and promoted AT2→AT1 differentiation, findings
demonstrate that mixed cellular monolayers can mimic the host response in COVID-19. A subtractive analysis
revealed that the cell type that is shared between models which showed induction of host response signatures
(i.e., ALO submerged monolayers and GSE155241

48;

Fig. 5F) but is absent in models that do not show such

response (hu Bronchial organoids, small airway epi, ALI-model of ALO) is AT1. We conclude that distal
differentiation from AT2→AT1, a complex process that is comprised of distinct intermediates

68,

is essential for

modeling the host immune response in COVID-19. Further experimental evidence is needed to directly confirm
if and which intermediate states during the differentiation of AT2 to AT1 is essential for the immune response to
COVID19.

Both proximal and distal airway epithelia are required to mount the overzealous host response in COVID-19
We next asked which model best simulated the overzealous host immune response that has been widely
implicated in fatal COVID-19. To this end, we relied upon a recently described artificial intelligence (AI)-guided
definition of the nature of the overzealous response in fatal COVID-19

69.

Using ACE2 as a seed gene, a 166-

gene signature was identified and validated as an invariant immune response that was shared among all
respiratory viral pandemics, including COVID-19 (Fig. 6A). A subset of 20 genes within the 166-gene signature
was subsequently identified as a determinant of disease severity/fatality; these 20 genes represented
translational arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. These two signatures, referred to as ViP (166-gene) and severe
ViP (20-gene) signatures, were used as a computational framework to first vet existing SARS-CoV-2 infection
models that have been commonly used for therapeutic screens (Fig. 6B-D). Surprisingly, we found that each
model fell short in one way or another. For example, the Vero E6, which is a commonly used cultured cell model,
showed a completely opposite response; instead of being induced, both the 166-gene and 20-gene ViP
signatures were suppressed in infected Vero E6 monolayers (Fig. 6B). Similarly, neither ViP signature was
induced in the case of SARS-CoV-2 challenged human bronchial organoids16 (Fig. 6C). Finally, in the case of
the hiPSC-derived AT1/2 organoids, which recapitulated the COVID-19-lung derived immune signatures (in Fig.
4F), the 166-gene ViP signature was induced significantly (Fig. 6D; top), but the 20-gene severity signature was
not (Fig. 6D; bottom). These findings show that none of the existing models capture the overzealous host
immune response that has been implicated in a fatality.
Our lung models showed that both the 166- and 20-gene ViP signatures were induced significantly in the
submerged ALO-derived monolayers that had distal differentiation (Fig. 6E; left), but not in the proximal-mimic
ALI model (Fig. 6E; right). Neither signatures were induced in monolayers of small airway epithelial cells (Fig.
6F) or hiPSC-derived AT2 cells (Fig. 6G).
Taken together with our infectivity analyses, these findings demonstrate that although the proximal airway
epithelia and AT2 cells may be infected, and as described by others

21,37,

may be vital for mounting a viral

response and for disease transmission, these cells alone cannot mount the overzealous host immune response
that is associated with the fatal disease. Similarly, even though the alveolar pneumocytes, AT1 and AT2 cells,
are sufficient to mount the host immune response, in the absence of proximal airway components, they too are
insufficient to recapitulate the severe ViP signature that is characterized by cellular senescence and apoptosis.
However, when both proximal and distal components are present, i.e., basal, ciliated and AT1 cells, the model
mimicked the overzealous host immune response in COVID-19 (Fig. 6H).

Discussion
The most important discovery we report here is the creation of adult lung organoids that are complete with both
proximal airway and distal alveolar epithelia; these organoids can not only be stably propagated and expanded
in 3D cultures but also used as monolayers of mixed cellularity for modeling viral and host immune responses
during respiratory viral pandemics. Furthermore, an objective analysis of this model and other existing SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.344002; this version posted December 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

CoV-2-infected lung models against patient-lung derived transcriptomes showed that the model which most
closely emulates the elements of viral infectivity, lung injury, and inflammation in COVID-19 is one that contained
both proximal and distal alveolar signatures (Fig 6H), whereas, the presence of just one or the other fell short.
There are three important impacts of this work. First, successful modeling of the human lung organoids
that are complete with both proximal and distal signatures has not been accomplished before. Previous works
show the successful use of airway basal cells for organoid creationtion, but ensuring the completeness of the
model with all other lung cells has been challenging to create

70.

The multicellularity of the lung has been a

daunting challenge that many experts have tried to recreate in vitro; in fact, the demand for perfecting such a
model has always remained high, not just in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic but also with the
potential of future pandemics. We have provided the evidence that the organoids that were created using our
methodology retain proximal and distal cellularity throughout multiple passages and even within the same
organoid. Although a systematic design of experiment (DoE) approach

71

was not involved in getting to this

desirable goal, a rationalized approach was taken. For example, a Wnt/R-spondin/Noggin-containing conditioned
media was used as a source of the so-called ‘niche factors’ for any organoid growth 72. This was supplemented
with recombinant FGF7/10; FGF7 is known to help cell proliferation and differentiation and is required for normal
branching morphogenesis 73, whereas FGF10 helps in cell maturation 74 and in alveolar regeneration upon injury
75.

Together, they are likely to have directed the differentiation toward distal lung lineages (hence, the

preservation of alveolar signatures). The presence of both distal alveolar and proximal ciliated cells was critical:
proximal cells were required to recreate sustained viral infectivity, and the distal alveolar pneumocytes, in
particular, the ability of AT2 cells to differentiate into AT1 pneumocytes was essential to recreate the host
response. It is possible that the response is mediated by a distinct AT2-lineage population, i.e., damageassociated transient progenitors (DATPs), which arise as intermediates during AT2→AT1 differentiation upon
injury-induced alveolar regeneration

68.

Although somewhat unexpected, the role of AT1 pneumocytes in

mounting innate immune responses has been documented before in the context of bacterial pneumonia 76,77. In
work

49

that was published during the preparation of this manuscript, authors used long-term ALI models of

hiPSC-derived AT2 monolayers (in growth conditions that inhibit AT2→AT1 differentiation, as we did here for
our AT2 model) and showed that SARS-CoV-2 induces iAT2-intrinsic cytotoxicity and inflammatory response,
but failed to induce type 1 interferon pathways (IFN α/β). It is possible that prolonged culture of iAT2
pneumocytes gives rise to some DATPs but cannot robustly do so in the presence of inhibitors of AT1
differentiation. This (spatially segregated viral and host immune response) is a common theme across many
lung infections (including bacterial pneumonia and other viral pandemics 37,78-80 and hence, this mixed cellularity
model is appropriate for use in modeling diverse lung infections and respiratory pandemics to come.
Second, among all the established lung models so far, ours features 4 key properties that are desirable
whenever disease models are being considered for their use in HTP modes for rapid screening of candidate
therapeutics and vaccines —(i) reproducibility, propagability and scalability, (ii) cost-effectiveness, (iii)
personalization, and (iv) modularity, with the potential to add other immune and non-immune cell types to our
multi-cellular complex lung model. We showed that the protocol we have optimized supports isolation, expansion

and propagability at least up to 12-15 passages (at the time of submission of this work), with documented
retention of proximal and distal airway components up to P8 (by RNA seq). Feasibility has also been established
for scaling up for use in 384-well HTP assays. We also showed that the protocols for generating lung organoids
could be reproduced in both genders and regardless of the donor’s smoking status, consistency in outcome and
growth characteristics were observed across all isolation attempts. The ALOs are also cost-effective; the need
for exclusive reliance on recombinant growth factors was replaced at least in part with conditioned media from a
commonly used cell line (L-WRN/ ATCC® CRL-2647 cells). Such media has a batch to batch stable cocktail of
Wnt, R-Spondin, and Noggin and has been shown to improve reproducibility in the context of GI organoids in
independent laboratories

81.

The use of conditioned media may not only have made our model more cost-

effective than others but also likely improved the rigor and reproducibility in lung modeling and research. Because
the model is propagable, repeated iPSC-reprogramming (another expensive step) is also eliminated, further
cutting costs compared to many other models. As for personalization, our model is derived from adult lung stem
cells from deep lung biopsies; each organoid line was established from one patient. By avoiding iPSCs or EPSCs,
this model not only captures genetics but also retains organ-specific epigenetic programming in the lung, and
hence, potentially additional programming that may occur in disease (such as in the setting of chronic infection,
injury, inflammation, somatic mutations, etc.). The ability to replicate donor phenotype and genotype in vitro
allows for potential use as pre-clinical human models for Phase ‘0’ clinical trials. As for modularity, by showing
that the 3D lung organoids could be used as polarized monolayers on transwells to allow infectious agents to
access the apical surface (in this case, SARS-CoV-2), we demonstrate that the organoids have the potential to
be reverse-engineered with additional components in a physiologically relevant spatially segregated manner: for
example, immune and stromal cells can be placed in the lower chamber to model complex lung diseases that
are yet to be modeled and have no cure (e.g., Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, etc).
Third, the value of the ALO models is further enhanced due to the availability of companion readouts/
biomarkers (e.g., ViP signatures in the case of respiratory viral pandemics, or monitoring the E gene, or viral
shedding, etc.) that can rapidly and objectively vet treatment efficacy based on set therapeutic goals. Of these
readouts, the host response, as assessed by ViP signatures, is a key vantage point because an overzealous
host response is what is known to cause fatality. Recently, a systematic review of the existing pre-clinical animal
models revealed that most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild patterns of human COVID-19;
no severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans
38

and animal models

82.

The model revealed here, in conjunction with the ViP signatures described earlier

69,

could serve as a pre-clinical model with companion diagnostics to identify drugs that target both the viral and
host response in pandemics.

Limitations of the study
Our adult stem-cell-derived lung organoids, complete with all epithelial cell types, can model COVID-19, but still
remains a simplified/rudimentary version compared to the adult human organ. Simultaneous addition of

endothelial cells and immune cells could be useful to better understand the pathophysiologic basis for DAD,
microangiopathy, and even organizing fibrosis with loss of lung capacity that has been observed in many
patients38; these insights should be valuable to fight some of the long-term sequelae of COVID-19. Future work
with flow cytometry and cell sorting of our lung organoids would help understand each cell type's role in viral
pathogenesis. Larger living biobanks of genotyped and phenotyped ALOs , representing donors of different age,
ethnicity, predisposing conditions and co-existing comorbidities, will advance our understanding of why SARSCoV-2 and possibly other infectious agents may trigger different disease course in different hosts. Although we
provide proof-of-concept studies in low throughput mode demonstrating the usefulness of the ALOs as human
pre-clinical models for screening therapeutics in Phase ‘0’ trials, optimization for the same to be adapted in HTP
mode was not attempted here.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. A rationalized approach to building and validating human pre-clinical models of COVID-19. A.
Whisker plots display relative levels of ACE2 expression in various cell types in the normal human lung. The cell
types were annotated within a publicly available single-cell sequencing dataset (GSE132914) using genes listed
in Table S1. p values were analyzed by one-way Anova and Tukey post hoc test. B. FFPE sections of the human
lung from normal and deceased COVID-19 patients were stained for SFTPC, alone or in combination with
nucleocapsid protein and analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence. Representative images are shown. Scale
bar = 20 µm. C. Schematic showing key steps generating an adult stem cell-derived, propagable, lung organoid
model, complete with proximal and distal airway components for modeling COVID-19-in-a-dish. D. A
transcriptome-based approach is used for cross-validation of in vitro lung models of SARS-CoV-2 infection (left)
versus the human disease, COVID-19 (right), looking for a match in gene expression signatures.
Figure 2. Adult stem cell-derived lung organoids are propagatable models with both proximal and distal
airway components. A. Schematic lists the various markers used here for qPCR and immunofluorescence to
confirm the presence of all cell types in the 3D lung organoids here and in 2D monolayers later (in Fig 3). B-H.
Bar graphs display the relative abundance of various cell type markers (normalized to 18S) in adult lung
organoids (ALO), compared to the airway (NHBE) and/or alveolar (AT2) control cells, as appropriate. p values
were analyzed by one-way Anova. Error bars denote S.E.M; n = 3-6 datasets from 3 independent ALOs and
representing early and late passages. See also Supplementary Figure 3 for individual ALOs. I-J. H&E-stained
cell blocks were prepared using HistoGel (I). Slides were stained for the indicated markers and visualized by
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Representative images are shown in J. Scale bar = 50 µm. K. 3D
organoids grown in 8-well chamber slides were fixed, immunostained and visualized by confocal microscopy as
in J. Scale bar = 50 µm. See also Supplementary Figure 2. Single channel images are max projections of zstacks; however, merged panels are optical sections to visualize the centers of the organoids.
Figure 3. Monolayers derived from lung organoids differentiate into proximal and distal airway
components. A-B. Samples collected at various steps of lung organoid isolation and expansion in culture, and
from the two types of monolayers prepared using the lung organoids were analyzed by RNA seq and the datasets
were compared for % cellular composition. Schematic in A shows the steps, and bar plots in B show the relative
proportion of various lung cell types. GLL = general lung lineage; VEM = viral entry markers (ACE2 and
TMPRSS2). C-D. hiPSC-derived AT2 cells and alveolospheres (C) were plated as monolayers and analyzed by
RNA seq. Bar plots in D show % cellular composition. E-F. Submerged ALO monolayers in transwells (E) or
monolayers were grown as ALI models (F) were fixed and stained for the indicated markers and visualized by
confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The representative max projected Z-stack images (left) and the
corresponding orthogonal images (right) are displayed. Arrows indicate AT2 cells. Arrowhead = Club cells. Scale
bar = 20 µm. G. Monolayers of ALO1-3 were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 for indicated time points prior to
fixation and staining for KRT5, SARS-COV2 viral nucleocapsid protein and DAPI and visualized by confocal

microscopy. Representative images are shown, displaying reticulovesicular network patterns and various
cytopathic effects. Scale bar = 15 µm. H. Monolayers of ALO, hiPSC-derived AT2 cells, and other alternative
models (see Supplementary Figure 4) were infected or not with SARS-CoV-2 and analyzed for infectivity by
qPCR (targeted amplification of viral envelope, E gene (G). I. ALO monolayers pre-treated for 4 h with either
vehicle (DMSO) control or EIDD-parent (NHC) or its metabolite EIDD-2801/MK-4482 were infected with SARSCoV-2 and assessed at 48 hpi for infectivity as in H. Line graphs display the relative expression of E gene. Error
bars display S.E.M. p value ** < 0.01; ***, < 0.001.
Figure 4. Gene expression patterns in the lungs of patients with COVID-19 is recapitulated in lung
organoid monolayers infected with SARS-CoV-2. A-C. Publicly available RNA Seq datasets (GSE151764) of
lung autopsies from patients who were deceased due to COVID-19 or non-infectious causes (healthy normal
control) were analyzed for differential expression of genes (B), and displayed as a heatmap labeled with selected
genes in C. See also Supplementary Figure 6 for a heatmap with all genes labeled. D. Reactome-pathway
analysis shows the major pathways up- or downregulated in COVID-19 lungs. See also Supplementary Figure
7 for visualization as hierarchical reacfoam. E. Bar plots display the ability of the differentially expressed genes
in the test cohort (GSE151764) to classify human COVID-19 respiratory samples from four other independent
cohorts. F. Bar plots display the ability of the differentially expressed genes in the test cohort (GSE151764) to
classify published in vitro models for SARS-CoV-2 infection where RNA Seq datasets were either generated in
this work or publicly available. G-H. Bar (top) and violin (bottom) plots compare the relative accuracy of disease
modeling in four in vitro models used in the current work, as determined by the induction of COVID-19 lung
signatures in each model. G; monolayer (left) and ALI models (right) prepared using adult lung organoids (ALOs).
H; Primary human small airway epithelium (left) and hiPSC –derived AT2-monolayers (right).
Figure 5. Genes and pathways induced in the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung organoid monolayers are
induced also in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. A-C. Adult lung organoid monolayers infected or not with
SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by RNA seq and differential expression analysis. Differentially expressed genes (B)
are displayed as a heatmap labeled with selected genes in C. See also Supplementary Figure 8 for a heatmap
with all genes labeled. D. Reactome-pathway analysis shows the major pathways upregulated in SARS-CoV-2infected lung organoid monolayers. See also Supplementary Figure 9 for visualization as hierarchical
reactome. E. A Venn diagram showing overlaps in DEGs between model (current work; 5B) and disease (COVID19 lung dataset, GSE151764; Fig 4). F. Bar plots display the ability of the DEGs in infected lung monolayers to
classify human normal vs COVID-19 respiratory samples from five independent cohorts. G-I. Bar (top) and violin
(bottom) plots compare the accuracy of disease modeling in three publicly available human lung datasets, as
determined by the significant induction of the DEGs that were identified in the SARS-CoV-2-challenged
monolayers.

human bronchial organoids (C) and hPSC-derived AT1/2 cell-predominant lung organoids are classified using
the 166-gene ViP signature (top row) and 20-gene severity signature (bottom row). E-G. RNA Seq datasets
generated in this work using either human small airway epithelial cells (E), adult lung organoids as submerged
or ALI models (left and right, respectively, in F) and hiPSC-derived AT2 cells (G) were analyzed and visualized

Detailed Methods
Collection of human lung specimens for organoid isolation
To generate adult healthy lung organoids, fresh biopsy bites were prospectively collected after surgical resection
of the lung by the cardiothoracic surgeon. Before collection of the lung specimens, each tissue was sent to a
gross anatomy room where a pathologist cataloged the area of focus, and the extra specimens were routed to
the research lab in Human Transport Media (HTM, Advanced DMEM/F-12, 10 mM HEPES, 1X Glutamax, 1X
penicillin-streptomycin, 5 M Y-27632) for cell isolation. Deidentified lung tissues obtained during surgical
resection, that were deemed excess by clinical pathologists, were collected using an approved human research
protocol (IRB# 101590; PI: Thistlethwaite). Isolation and biobanking of organoids from these lung tissues were
carried out using an approved human research protocol (IRB# 190105: PI Ghosh and Das) that covers human
subject research at the UC San Diego HUMANOID Center of Research Excellence (CoRE). For all the
deidentified human subjects, information including age, gender, and previous history of the disease, was
collected from the chart following the rules of HIPAA and described in the Table.
A portion of the same lung tissue specimen was fixed in 10% Zinc-Formalin for at least 24hrs followed
by submersion in 70% EtOH until embedding in FFPE blocks.
Autopsy procedures for lung tissue collection from COVID-19 positive human subjects
The lung specimens from COVID-19 positive human subjects were collected through autopsy (the study was
IRB Exempt). All donations to this trial were obtained after telephone consent followed by written email
confirmation by the next of kin/power of attorney per California state law (no in-person visitation could be allowed
into our COVID-19 ICU during the pandemic). The team member followed the CDC guidelines for COVID19 and
the autopsy procedures1,2). Lung specimens were collected in 10% Zinc-formalin and stored for 72 hrs before
processing for histology. Patient characteristics are listed in the Table.
Autopsy #2 was a standard autopsy performed by anatomical pathology in the BSL3 autopsy suite. The patient
expired and his family consented for autopsy. After 48 hrs, the lungs were removed and immersion fixed whole
in 10% formalin for 48 hrs and then processed further. Lungs were only partially fixed at this time (about 50%
fixed in thicker segments) and were sectioned into small 2-4 cm chunks and immersed in 10% formalin for further
investigation.
Autopsy #4 and #5 were collected from rapid post-mortem lung biopsies. The procedure was performed
in the Jacobs Medical Center ICU (all of the ICU rooms have a pressure-negative environment, with air
exhausted through HEPA filters [Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3)] for isolation of SARS-CoV-2 virus). Biopsies were
performed 2-4 hrs after patient expiration. The ventilator was shut off to reduce the aerosolization of viral
particles at least 1 hr after the loss of pulse and before sample collection. Every team member had personal
protective equipment in accordance with the University policies for procedures on patients with COVID-19 (N95
mask + surgical mask, hairnet, full face shield, surgical gowns, double surgical gloves, booties). Lung biopsies

were obtained after L-thoracotomy in the 5th intercostal space by the cardiothoracic surgery team. Samples
were taken from the left upper lobe (LUL) and left lower lobe (LLL) and then sectioned further.
Isolation and culture of human whole lung-derived organoids
A previously published protocol was modified to isolate lung organoids from 3 human subjects3,4. Briefly, normal
human lung specimens were washed with PBS/4X penicillin-streptomycin and minced with surgical scissors.
Tissue fragments were resuspended in 10 mL of wash buffer (Advanced DMEM/F-12, 10 mM HEPES, 1X
Glutamax, 1X penicillin-streptomycin) containing 2 mg/ml Collagenase Type I (Thermo Fisher, USA) and
incubated at 37°C for approximately 1 hr. During incubation, tissue pieces were sheared every 10 min with a 10
mL serological pipette and examined under a light microscope to monitor the progress of digestion. When 80100% of single cells were released from connective tissue, the digestion buffer was neutralized with 10 mL wash
buffer with added 2% Fetal Bovine Serum; the suspension was passed through a 100-µm cell strainer and
centrifuged at 200 rcf. Remaining erythrocytes were lysed in 2 ml red blood cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen) at room
temperature for 5 min, followed by the addition of 10 mL of wash buffer and centrifugation at 200 rcf. Cell pellets
were resuspended in cold Matrigel (Corning, USA) and seeded in 25 µl droplets on a 12 well tissue culture plate.
The plate was inverted and incubated at 37°C for 10 min to allow complete polymerization of the Matrigel before
the addition of 1 mL Lung Expansion Medium per well. Lung expansion media was prepared by modifying the
GI-organoid media (50% conditioned media, prepared from L-WRN cells with Wnt3a, R-spondin, and Noggin,
ATCC-CRL-3276TM)

5-8

with a proprietary cocktail from the HUMANOID CoRE containing B27, TGF-β receptor

inhibitor, antioxidants, p38 MAPK inhibitor, FGF 7, FGF 10 and ROCK inhibitor. The lung expansion media was
compared to alveolosphere media I (IMDM and F12 as the basal medium with B27, low concentration of KGF,
Monothioglycerol, GSK3 inhibitor, Ascorbic acid, Dexamethasone, IBMX, cAMP and ROCK inhibitor) and II (F12
as the basal medium with added CaCl2, B27, low concentration of KGF, GSK3 inhibitor, TGF-β receptor inhibitor
Dexamethasone, IBMX, cAMP and ROCK inhibitor) modified from previously published literature

9,10.

Neither

alvelosphere media contain any added Wnt3a, R-spondin, and Noggin. The composition of these media was
developed either by fundamentals of adult-stem cell-derived mixed epithelial cellularity in other organs (like the
gastrointestinal tract

8,11,12,

or rationalized based on published growth conditions for proximal and distal airway

components3,13,14. Organoids were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C/5% CO2, with a complete media
change performed every 3 days. After the organoids reached confluency between 7-10 days, organoids were
collected in PBS/0.5 mM EDTA and centrifuged at 200 rcf for 5 min. Organoids were dissociated in 1 mL trypLE
Select (Gibco, USA) per well at 37°C for 4-5 min and mechanically sheared. Wash buffer was added at a 1:5,
trypLE to wash buffer ratio. The cell suspension was subsequently centrifuged, resuspended in Matrigel, and
seeded at a 1:5 ratio. Lung organoids were biobanked and passage 3-8 cells were used for experiments.
Subculture was performed every 7-10 days.
The preparation of Lung organoid-derived monolayers
Lung-organoid-derived monolayers were prepared using a modified protocol of GI-organoid-derived monolayers
5-8.

Briefly, transwell inserts (6.5 mm diameter, 0.4 um pore size, Corning) were coated in Matrigel diluted in cold

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.344002; this version posted December 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

PBS at a 1:40 ratio and incubated for 1hr at room temperature. Confluent organoids were collected in PBS/EDTA
on day 7 and dissociated into single cells in trypLE for 6-7 min at 37°C. Following enzymatic digestion, the cell
suspension was mechanically sheared through vigorous pipetting with a 1000 µl pipette and neutralized with
wash buffer. The suspension was centrifuged, resuspended in Pneumacult Ex-Plus Medium (StemCell, Canada),
and passed through a 70-µm cell strainer. The coating solution was aspirated, and cells were seeded onto the
apical membrane at 1.8E5 cells per transwell with 200 µl PneumaCult Ex-Plus media. 700 µl of PneumaCult ExPlus was added to the basal chamber. Cells were cultured over the course of 2-4 days. A media change of both
the apical and basal chambers was performed every 24 hrs.
Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) Model of Lung organoids
Organoids were dissociated into single cells and expanded in T-75 flasks in PneumaCult Ex-Plus Medium until
confluency was reached. Cells were dissociated in ACF Enzymatic Dissociation Solution (StemCell, Canada) for
6-7 min at 37°C and neutralized in equal volume ACF Enzyme Inhibition Solution (StemCell, Canada). Cells
were seeded in the apical chamber of transwells at 3.3E4 cells per transwell in 200 µL of PneumaCult Ex-Plus
Medium. 500 µL of PneumaCult Ex-Plus was added to the basal chamber. Media in both chambers was changed
every other day until confluency was reached (~4 days). The media was completely removed from the apical
chamber, and media in the basal chamber was replaced with ALI Maintenance Medium (StemCell, Canada).
The media in the basal chamber was changed every 2 days. The apical chamber was washed with warm PBS
every 5-7 days to remove accumulated mucus. Cells were cultured under ALI conditions for 21+ days until they
completed differentiation into a pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium. To assess the integrity of the epithelial
barrier, Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) was measured with an Epithelial Volt-Ohm Meter (Millicell,
USA). The media was removed from the basal chamber, and wash media was added to both chambers. Cultures
were equilibrated to 37°C before TEER values were measured. Final values were expressed as Ωꞏcm2 units and
were calculated by multiplying the growth area of the membrane by the raw TEER value.
The culture of primary airway epithelial cells and iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial cells
Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were obtained from Lonza and grown according to
instructions. NHBE cells were cultured in T25 cell culture tissue flasks with PneumaCult-Ex Plus media
(StemCell, Canada). Cells were seeded at ~100,000 cells/T25 flask and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Once cells
reached 70–80% confluency, they were dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin in dissociation media and plated in 24
well transwells (Corning). Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) and small airway epithelial cells
(HSAEpC) were obtained from Cell Applications Inc. The HBEpC and HSAEpC were cultured in human
bronchial/tracheal epithelial cell media and small airway epithelial cell media, respectively, following the
instructions of Cell Application.
Human iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iHAEpC2) were obtained from Cell Applications Inc.
and cultured in growth media (i536K-05, Cell Applications Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All
the primary cells were used within early passages (5-6) to avoid any gradual disintegration of the airway
epithelium with columnar epithelial structure and epithelial integrity.

The infection with SARS-Cov2
Lung organoid-derived monolayers or primary airway epithelial cells either in 384 well plates or in transwells
were washed twice with antibiotic-free lung wash media. 1E5 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 (BEI
Resources NR-52281) in complete DMEM was added to the apical side of the transwell and allowed to incubate
for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs at 34°C and 5% CO2. After incubation, the media was removed from the basal side of
the transwell. The apical side of the transwells was then washed twice with (antibiotic-free lung wash media) and
then twice with PBS. TRIzol™ Reagent (Thermo Fisher 15596026) was added to the well and incubated at 34˚C
and 5% CO2 for 10 min. The TRIzol™ Reagent was removed and stored at -80 ˚C for RNA analysis.
RNA isolation
Organoids and monolayers used for lung cell type studies were lysed using RNA lysis buffer followed by RNA
extraction per Zymo Research Quick-RNA MicroPrep Kit instructions. Tissue samples and monolayers in SARSCoV2 studies were lysed in TRI-Reagent and RNA was extracted using Zymo Research Direct-zol RNA Miniprep.
Quantitative (q)RT-PCR
Organoid and monolayer cell-type gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR using 2x SYBR Green qPCR
Master Mix. cDNA was amplified with gene-specific primer/probe set for the lung cell type markers and qScript
cDNA SuperMix (5x). qRT-PCR was performed with the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR
System. Cycling parameters were as follows: 95 °C for 20 s, followed by 40 cycles of 1 s at 95 °C and 20 s at
60 °C. All samples were assayed in triplicate and eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA was used as a reference.

eukaryotic 18S ribosomal RNA was used as a reference.
Immunofluorescence
Organoids and Lung organoid-Derived Monolayers were fixed by either: (1) 4% PFA at room temperature for 30
min and quenched with 30 mM glycine for 5 min, (2) ice-cold 100% Methanol at -20°C for 20 min, (3) ice-cold
100% Methanol on ice for 20 min. Subsequently, samples were permeabilized and blocked for 2 hrs using an inhouse blocking buffer (2 mg/mL BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS); as described previously17. Primary
antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and allowed to incubate overnight at 4°C; Secondary antibodies were
diluted in blocking buffer and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs in the dark. Antibody dilutions are listed in the
Supplementary Key Resource Table. ProLong Glass was used as a mounting medium. #1 Thick Coverslips were
applied to slides and sealed. Samples were stored at 4°C until imaged. FFPE embedded Organoid and Lung
Tissue sections underwent antigen retrieval as previously described in methods for Immunohistochemistry
staining. After antigen retrieval and cooling in DI water; samples were permeabilized and blocked in blocking
buffer and treated as mentioned above for immunofluorescence. Images were acquired at room temperature
with Leica TCS SPE confocal and with DMI4000 B microscope using the Leica LAS-AF Software. Images were
taken with a 40× oil-immersion objective using 405-,488-, 561-nm laser lines for excitation. Z-stack images were
acquired by successive Z-slices of 1µm in the desired confocal channels. Fields of view that were representative
and/or of interest were determined by randomly imaging 3 different fields. Z-slices of a Z-stack were overlaid to
create maximum intensity projection images; all images were processed using FIJI (Image J) software.
Embedding of Organoids in HistoGel
Organoids were seeded on a layer of Matrigel in 6-Well plates and grown for 7-8 days. Once mature, organoids
were fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 min and quenched with 30 mM glycine for 5 min. Organoids
were gently washed with PBS and harvested using a cell scraper. Organoids were resuspended in PBS using
wide-bore 1000 µL pipette tips. Organoids were stained using Gill’s hematoxylin for 5 min for easier FFPE
embedding and sectioning visualization. Hematoxylin stained organoids were gently washed in PBS and
centrifuged and excess hematoxylin was aspirated. Organoids were resuspended in 65°C histogel and
centrifuged at 65°C for 5 min. Histogel embedded organoid pellets were allowed to cool to room temperature
and stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C until ready for FFPE embedding by LJI Histology Core. Successive FFPE
embedded organoid sections were cut at a 4 µm thickness and fixed on to microscope slides.
Immunohistochemistry
For SARS CoV- nucleoprotein (np) antigen retrieval, slides were immersed in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) and
boiled for 10 min at 100°C inside a pressure cooker. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation

with 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes. To block non-specific protein binding 2.5% goat serum was added. Tissues were
then incubated with a rabbit SARS CoV-NP antibody (Sino Biological, See Supplementary Key Resource Table)
for 1.5 hrs at room temperature in a humidified chamber and then rinsed with TBS or PBS 3 times, for 5 min
each. Sections were incubated with horse anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature
and then washed with TBS or PBS 3 times for 5 min each. Sections were incubated with DAB and counterstained
with hematoxylin for 30 sec.
RNA Sequencing
RNA sequencing libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold with
TruSeq Unique Dual Indexes (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Samples were processed following manufacturer’s
instructions, except modifying RNA shear time to five minutes. The resulting libraries were multiplexed and
sequenced with 100 basepair (bp) Paired-End (PE100) to a depth of approximately 25-40 million reads per
sample on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 by the Institute of Genomic Medicine (IGM) at the University of California
San Diego. Samples were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq v2.20 Conversion Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
RNASeq data was processed using kallisto (version 0.45.0), and human genome GRCh38 Ensembl version 94
annotation (Homo_sapiens GRCh38.94 chr_patch_hapl_scaff.gtf). Gene-level TPM values and gene
annotations were computed using tximport and biomaRt R package. A custom python script was used to organize
the data and log reduced using log2(TPM+1). The raw data and processed data are deposited in Gene
Expression Omnibus under accession no GSE157055, and GSE157057.
Data Collection and Annotation
Publicly available COVID-19 gene expression databases were downloaded from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus website (GEO)

18-20.

If the dataset is not

normalized, RMA (Robust Multichip Average)21,22 is used for microarrays and TPM (Transcripts Per Millions)23,24
is used for RNASeq data for normalization. We used log2(TPM+1) to compute the final log-reduced expression
values for RNASeq data. Accession numbers for these crowdsourced datasets are provided in the figures and
manuscript. All of the above datasets were processed using the Hegemon data analysis framework 25-27.

was applied to uninfected and infected samples to identify Up- and Down-regulated genes. A gene

signature score is computed using both the Up- and Down- regulated genes which are used to order the sample.
To compute the gene signature score, first, the genes present in this list were normalized according to a modified
Z-score approach centered around StepMiner threshold (formula = (expr -SThr)/3*stddev). The normalized
expression values for every probeset for all the genes were added or subtracted (depending on Up and Downregulated genes) together to create the final score. The samples were ordered based on the final gene signature
score. The Gene signature score is used to classify sample categories and the performance of the multi-class

classification is measured by ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristics Area Under The Curve) values. A
color-coded bar plot is combined with a violin plot to visualize the gene signature-based classification. All
statistical tests were performed using R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10). Standard t-tests were performed using
python scipy.stats.ttest_ind package (version 0.19.0) with Welch’s Two Sample t-test (unpaired, unequal
variance (equal_var=False), and unequal sample size) parameters. Multiple hypothesis correction was
performed by adjusting p values with statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests (fdr_bh: Benjamini/Hochberg
principles). The results were independently validated with R statistical software (R version 3.6.1; 2019-07-05).
Pathway analysis of gene lists was carried out via the Reactome database and algorithm 29. Reactome identifies
signaling and metabolic molecules and organizes their relations into biological pathways and processes. Violin,
Swarm and Bubble plots are created using python seaborn package version 0.10.1.
Single Cell RNA Seq data analysis
Single Cell RNASeq data from GSE145926 was downloaded from GEO in the HDF5 Feature Barcode Matrix
Format. The filtered barcode data matrix was processed using Seurat v3 R package30 and scanpy python
package31. Pseudo bulk analysis of GSE145926 data was performed by adding counts from the different cell
subtypes and normalized using log2(CPM+1). Epithelial cells were identified using SFTPA1, SFTPB, AGER,
AQP4, SFTPC, SCGB3A2, KRT5, CYP2F1, CCDC153, and TPPP3 genes using SCINA algorithm32. Pseudo
bulk datasets were prepared by adding counts from the selected cells and normalized using log (CPM+1).
Assessment of cell-type proportions
CIBERSORTx (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/runcibersortx.php) was used for cell-type deconvolution of our
dataset (which was normalized by CPM). As reference samples, we first used the Single Cell RNASeq dataset
(GSE132914) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Next, we analyzed the bulk RNA seq datasets for the
identification of cell types of interest using relevant gene markers (see Table 2): AT1 cells (PDPN, AQP5, P2RX4,
TIMP3, SERPINE1), AT2 cells (SFTPA1, SFTPB, SFTPC, SFTPD, SCGB1A1, ABCA3, LAMP3), BASAL cells
(CD44, KRT5, KRT13, KRT14, CKAP4, NGFR, ITGA6), CLUB cells (SCGB1A1, SCGB3A2, SFTPA1, SFTPB,
SFTPD, ITGA6, CYP2F1), GOBLET cells (MUC5AC, MUC5B, TFF3), Ciliated cells (ACTG2, TUBB4A, FOXA3,
FOXJ1, SNTN), Generic Lung Lineage cells (GJA1, TTF1, EPCAM) and cells for Viral Entry Markers
(ACE2,TMPRSS2) were identified using SCINA algorithm. Then, normalized pseudo counts were obtained with
the CPM normalization method. The cell-type signature matrix was derived from the Single Cell RNASeq dataset,
cell-types, and gene markers of interest. It was constructed by taking an average from gene expression levels
for each of the markers across each cell type.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times, and results were presented either as one representative
experiment or as average ± S.E.M. Statistical significance between datasets with three or more experimental
groups was determined using one-way ANOVA including a Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. For all tests,

a P-value of 0.05 was used as the cutoff to determine significance (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P
< 0.0001). All experiments were repeated a least three times, and P-values are indicated in each figure. All
statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad prism 6.1. A part of the statistical tests was performed using
R version 3.2.3 (2015-12-10). Standard t-tests were performed using python scipy.stats.ttest_ind package
(version 0.19.0).
