Abstract:
Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) warrants comprehensive investigations of publicly
available Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes to gain
new insight about their epidemiology, mutations and pathogenesis. Nearly 0.4 million mutations
were identified so far in ~60,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. In this study, we compared
207 of SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported from different parts of Bangladesh and their comparison
with 467 globally reported sequences to understand the origin of viruses, possible patterns of
mutations, availability of unique mutations, and their apparent impact on pathogenicity of the
virus in victims of Bangladeshi population. Phylogenetic analyses indicates that in Bangladesh,
SARS-CoV-2 viruses might arrived through infected travelers from European countries, and the
GR clade was found as predominant in this region. We found 2602 mutations including 1602
missense mutations, 612 synonymous mutations, 36 insertions and deletions with 352 other
mutations types. In line with the global trend, D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein was
predominantly high (95.6%) in Bangladeshi isolates. Interestingly, we found the average number
of mutations in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M and N of genomes, having nucleotide shift at G614
(n=459), were significantly higher (p≤0.001) than those having mutation at D614 (n=215).
Previously reported frequent mutations such as P4715L, D614G, R203K, G204R and I300F were
also prevalent in Bangladeshi isolates. Additionally, 87 unique amino acid changes were
revealed and were categorized as originating from different cities of Bangladesh. The analyses
would increase our understanding of variations in virus genomes circulating in Bangladesh and
elsewhere and help develop novel therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction:
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become an
etiological agent of the disease called CoronaVirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). As of 21 August
2020, globally there have been 22,492,312 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 788,503
deaths, reported to WHO. To explore the viral pathogenesis, modern genomics tools are highly
crucial and has been employed by researchers around the world. Hundreds of virus whole
genomes are now submitted in publicly accessible databases from different parts of the globe
everyday. It is hightime to analyze the variations among those sequences which will help future
strategic efforts for its preventive measures such as vaccine design and therapeutics. SARS-CoV2 consists of positive-sense single-stranded RNA with a genome size ranging from ~27 to 34 Kb.
It contains a variable number (6-11) of open-reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF is almost
two-third of the whole genome and encodes four structural, 16 non-structural and eight accessory
proteins [1,2]. According to a recent study on 48,635 of SARS CoV-2 genome sequences,
353,341 mutation events have been observed globally in comparison to the reference genome of
Wuhan. Among these sequences, India, Congo, Bangladesh and Kazakhstan have significantly
high numbers of mutations per sample compared to the global average [3]. Out of these
mutations, D614G mutation (causing aspartate to glycine in S protein position 614) is reported to
be the most prevalent mutations reported from Europe, Oceania, South America, Africa [4].
Zhang et al. (2020) reported that the level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
expression was distinctly higher by the retroviruses pseudotyped with G614 compared to that of
D614 [4,5]. The functional properties of the (D614) and (G614) were compared in this study and
G614 was found to be more stable than D614 with more transmission efficiency, supporting the
previous epidemiological data [5]. Another reported mutation of ORF1ab is P4715L linked with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.267658; this version posted August 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

D614G, that has been reported to have a strong relationship with higher fatality rates in 28
countries and 17 states of the United States [3,6]. Three other mutations namely C14408T
(ORF1b), C241T (5’ UTR), C3037T (ORF1a) is reported to be common and co-occurring in the
same genome while G11083T has been found mostly in Asian countries [6]. Hassan et al. (2020)
investigated the accumulation of ORF3a mutations of SARS-CoV-2 from India where they
revealed four types of mutations (Q>H, D>Y and S>L) near TRAF, ion channel and caveolin
binding domain, respectively [7]. Notable that all these mutations might have implications in
maintaining the virulence of the virus and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
In Bangladesh, as of 21 August, 2020, nearly 287,959 people are infected and 3822
people have died due to COVID-19 (https://iedcr.gov.bd/). Among them, 329 of SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences were deposited in GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org). Analysis of
these sequences is sparsely reported in the literature. For example, Islam et al. (2020) analyzed
60 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from Bangladesh and compared them with only six
Southeast Asian countries [8]. On the other hand, Parvez et al. (2020) analyzed only 14 isolates
and found 42 mutations [9]. Hasan et al. (2020) identified only nine variants where unique
mutations (UM) were found prevalent mostly in ORF1ab [10]. However, Shishir et al. (2020)
analyzed 64 sequences and identified the presence of 180 mutations in the coding regions of the
viruses and mutations at nsp2 was the most prevalent [11]. Due to the small numbers of genome
sequence analyzed, most of these findings were not conclusive and representative. Further
comprehensive analyses is therefore necessary to better understand the circulating virus in the
country.
In this study, we first compared 207 genome sequences isolated from Bangladesh with
467 global sequences mainly from Asia, Africa, Europe, Australia and North America using

time-resolved phylogenetic analysis and investigated the origin of imported COVID-19 cases to
Bangladesh. Then, we studied the variants present in different isolates of Bangladesh to
investigate the pattern of mutations, identify UMs, and discuss the pseudo-effect of these
mutations on the structure and function of encoded proteins, with their role in pathogenicity.
Most interestingly, we found 87 UMs with a total count of 113 in Bangladeshi isolates which
will increase our understanding of distribution of SARS-CoV-2 virus in different regions and
associated pathogenicity.

2. Methods and materials:
2.1 Dataset
As of 30 June, 2020, a total of 35,723 whole genomic RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 had been
submitted to GISAID. From these downloaded sequences, a custom python script was used to
retrieve unique sequences. The same script also removed any sequence containing “N” and other
ambiguous IUPAC codes [12]. This resulted in a total of 8723 complete genomic sequences. To
select representative sequences from curated 8723 sequences and make a comparison against
sequences from Bangladesh, priorities were given to those countries that had a higher number of
infections in each continent (source: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). We selected
these sequences in such a way that each continent must contain at least one sequence from each
GISAID clade. The number of sequences selected from a country was based on the total number
of unique sequences retrieved. This resulted in a total of 467 unique representative sequences
from 42 countries (see Supporting File Table S1).

2.2 Phylogenetic analysis
From Bangladesh, 215 whole-genome RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were uploaded to
GISAID as of 15 July, 2020. Only high coverage complete sequences (n=207) were kept for
analysis. All these 207 sequences were aligned with the previously selected 467 representative
sequences along with that of Wuhan-1 (Accession ID MN908947) as a reference sequence [13].
To ensure comparability, the flanks of all the sequences were truncated to the consensus range
from 56 to 29,797 [14], with nucleotide position numbering according to the Wuhan 1 reference
sequence, prior to alignment. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and phylogenetic tree
construction were carried out using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis (MEGA X)
software [15]. All selected sequences were aligned using MUSCLE software tool [16]. Later, an
NJ (Neighbor-Joining) phylogenetic tree [17] was constructed using the Tamura-Nei method.
Tree topology was assessed using a fast bootstrapping function with 1000 replicates. Tree
visualization and annotations were performed in the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL) v5 [18].

(https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov/) [19]. For analysis of (UM) among 207
genomic sequences from Bangladesh, we used a CoV server hosted in GISAID server
(https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/covsurver-app/). The server analyzed our dataset
against all available genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 including the Wuhan reference
sequence deposited on GISAID until July 16, 2020.

2.4 Statistical analysis
Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze different mutations and their
correlation with different categorical variables. For correlation, we used one-way analysis of
variance using SPSS Statistics 25 (IBM, Armonk, New York) licensed to King’s College
London.

3. Results and discussion:
3.1 Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Bangladesh
To understand the SARS-CoV-2 viral transmission in Bangladesh, we performed phylogenetic
analysis on the selected 207 viral genomes reported from different districts of Bangladesh along
with selected 467 globally submitted sequences as reported from 42 countries and 6 continents
(Figure 1). This apparently represents the overall clade distribution of all global sequences along
with sequences from Bangladeshi isolates. GR clade was found predominant in Bangladesh as
about 84% of the sequences were grouped to this clade followed by GH and G with ~6 and ~5%,
respectively. Similar clade distribution has been found in isolates submitted from European
countries. We also attempted to compare the sequence data among different districts of
Bangladesh from where patient samples were collected for sequencing, Looking at the districtwise distribution of clade (Figure 2), it was found that the sequences from three districts, namely
Dhaka, Narayanganj and Rangpur primarily belong to GR clade. Conversely, only sequences
from Chattogram district were from S and GH clades. On another note, phylogenetic analyses of
the clade distribution of isolates from countries like Saudi Arabia, where GH clade was

predominant [3] it is highly likely that the introduction of GH and S clades in Bangladesh could
be of Middle-Eastern origin. Based on the datsets, we hypothesized that Bangladeshi SARSCoV-2 isolates belonging to different clades might have critical implications concerning viral
transmission rate, virulence, severity and other aspects of disease pathogenesis. In addition, the
presence of different clades of SARS-CoV-2 strains in different districts could also have
implications in the accuracy of diagnostic tests that are underway.

3.2 Mutations analysis in Bangladeshi genomic sequences
3.2.1 Prevalence of global common mutations:
Our analyses revealed a total of 2602 mutations observed among 207 Bangladeshi genomic
sequences that constitutes a number of 1602 missense, 612 synonymous, 36 insertion/deletions
and 352 other mutations (Table 1). We identified mutations like I300F (nsp2), P4715L (nsp12),
D614G (S glycoprotein), R203K and G204R (N protein) are the most frequently occurring
common mutations found in Bangladesh with a frequency of 138, 199, 198, 177 and 177,
respectively (Figure 3). Notable that, no particular mutations occurred at any specific time period
rather they have been observed over the whole period of disease incidence. Firstly, 1163A>T
(I300F), can be a destabilizing factor for nsp2 and thus modulating the strategy of host cell
survival [11,20]. This mutation can lead to a reduction of conformational entropy due to the
presence of the side chains that can result in charge neutralization of the phosphorylated serine
residues [21]. Secondly, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) is significant for replication
and transcription of the viral RNA genome. Therefore, P > L at 4715 in nsp12 may have some
effects on RNA transcription. This mutation was also observed in most of the USA states (28 out

of 31). The same mutation was prevalent in European countries like Spain, France etc. This
alteration could affect the pathogenesis triggered by antibody escape variants with the epitope
loss [22,23]. Thirdly, Korber et al. (2020) stated that the G614 type might have originated either
in Europe or China [24]. They also reported that the original Wuhan D614 form was also
predominant in Asian samples. Meanwhile, the G614 form had clearly established and started
expanding in countries outside of China. We also noticed 95.6% of genomes from Bangladesh
have D614G mutation, which is also dominant in the world. However, the average number of
mutations per ORF is varied among D614 and G614 containing genomes that we have studied
(n=674) as revealed by Table 2. The average number of mutations in ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M and
N of genomes having mutated G614 (n=459) are significantly higher (p≤0.001) than those
having wild D614 (n=215) in S glycoprotein (Table 2; Figure 1). Interestingly, the average
mutation number is declined in ORF8 of genomes having G614 mutation (p<0.001). This
correlation indicates that the genomes containing D614G mutation are more prone to bear other
mutations which may facilitate the notion that the link of this mutation with the transmission and
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 [4,12,25]. Finally, R203K and G204R mutations in N protein were
previously reported in Indian, Spanish, Italian, and French samples [21,26]. These mutations are
located in the site of the SR-rich region which has been reported to be intrinsically disordered
[27]. This region further incorporates a few phosphorylation sites [28], including the GSK3
phosphorylation at Ser202 and a CDK phosphorylation site at Ser206 which are located close to
the position of this mutation. The ‘SRGTS’ (202-206) and ‘SPAR’ (206-209) sequence motifs
are dependent on GSK3 and CDK phosphorylation motifs, respectively. Other variations
(28881G>A and 28882G>A) together convert polar to non-polar amino acid (R203K) and
28883G>C variation converts nonpolar to polar amino acid (G204R).

3.2.2 Unique mutations (UM) analysis in Bangladeshi isolates:
We observed 87 unique shifts from the different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in
Bangladesh (Table S2). Details of their pseudo-effects on viral replication, assembly,
transmissivity and pathogenicity are corroborated in Table S2. Surprisingly, most of these UM
were localized except a few exceptions. For example, the UMs E8D (E), S180T (N), L139J and
S220N (NS3), S54P (NS8), V56A (nsp1), A550V and S607I (nsp12), Q470R and Y198H
(nsp13), V437F (nsp14), D409B and N377D (nsp2), T1363I and Y246C (nsp3), D85E (nsp4),
N133B and R188S (nsp5) and S939Y (S) were only found in Dhaka, which is the capital city of
Bangladesh. The second most important city in Bangladesh is Chattogram where many UMs
were found, such as G254stop (NS3), N39Y (NS6), L4I, L7G and V5T (NS8), T101I, (nsp10),
V459I (nsp14), A602S, N1337S and I1672S (nsp3). Similarly, Rangpur has UMs of F20L (E),
Q83R (N), W69R (NS3), G42V (NS7), Q224K (nsp12), I258T (nsp13), R883G, S1038F and
Y272H (nsp3). Barishal also shows UMs of E194Q and G188C (NS3), Q62E (NS7a), A529S,
D517G and E254D (nsp12), L22I (nsp6) and T81A (nsp7). A few UMs have been observed in
some other districts like Chandpur, Pabna, Rajshahi, Tangail, Pabna and Brahmanbaria. These
changes in amino acids might have occurred due to rapid mutation and/or recombination with
existing other CoV in the human body [7]. Another possibility of these mutations is the zoonotic
origin of the SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh. Interestingly, some districts shared UMs, such as
Q38E (Rajshahi, Pabna and Barishal), S220N (Dhaka and Rajshahi), V255del (Narayanganj and
Barishal) in NS3; P38R (Brahmanbaria, Chandpur and Pabna) in NS8; V469A (Chattogram and
Barishal), V594F (Brahmanbaria, Chandpur and Pabna) in nsp2; L373M (Brahmanbaria,
Rajshahi and Moulvibazar); N51D (Dhaka, Chattagram and Barishal) in nsp3; I106S (Chandpur

and Hobigonj) in nsp5; K270E (Dhaka and Barishal), V120L (Pabna and Hobigonj) in nsp6; and
F140del (Rangpur and Dhaka), L518I (Rajshahi, Brahmanbaria and Moulvibazar), N211Y
(Dhaka and Chandpur) in S protein. Circulation of a high number of these UMs in different
cities, indicates the possible emergence of community transmission in Bangladeshi population
[29].
Among 87 amino acids mutations, 66 mutations were located in nsps-1 (4), 2 (9), 3 (22),
4 (3), 5 (5), 6(5), 7(1), 10 (1), nsp- 12 (7), 13 (3), 14(2) and 15 (4) at ORF1ab. These 66 UMs
constitute around 60% of the total UMs found which imply most of the change of SARS-CoV-2's
virulence property in Bangladesh patients. ORF1ab encodes a multifunctional polyprotein which
is involved in the transcription and replication of CoV RNAs. We observed 4 UMs in nsp1, but
the location of these amino acids was not in the KH domain (K164 and H165 of nsp1), which
binds with ribosome 40s subunit [30]. However, nsp1 acts as a primary virulence factor in
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and mutation in this protein could affect the structure and functional
properties, thereby altering its virulence properties. Nine UMs were seen in nsp2, but their
effects on host cells were merely reported in the literature. Since nsp2 interacts with the host
proteins and disrupts the host cell survival signaling pathway [31], any mutation in nsp2 may
play a crucial role in SARS-CoV infections. In a recent study, it has been found that, compared
to Bat SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a stabilizing mutation at amino acid position 501, T501Q,
which alters the viral pathogenicity and makes the virus more contagious [32]. We did not
observe this mutation in our study. The mutations of nsp3 are responsible for affecting the virus
assembly and hence their replication. It is due to the disruption of replicase polyprotein
processing into nsps. These nsps assemble with cellular membranes and facilitate virus
replication. The UMs found in nsp3 might have some probable effects. Firstly, the UMs (A889V,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.267658; this version posted August 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

R883G, S1038F and V843F) were found in the main domain of nsp3 that is important for
processing endopeptidases from coronaviruses. Secondly, many UM (e.g. A1803V, A1819S,
G1691C, I1672S, A602S, D782B, K462R, L373M, N1337S, N51D, R883G, T1363Is, Y246C
and Y272H etc) are found in topological (cytoplasmic) domain rather than transmembrane
domain which could interfere less on cytoplasmic double-membrane vesicle formation,
necessary for viral replication. Thirdly, we observed three UMs (L373M, Y246C and Y272H) in
ADP-ribose-1′-phosphatase (ADRP) or (Macro) domain. It has been shown that mutations of the
ADRP domains does not diminish virus replication in mice, but reduces the production of the
cytokine IL-6, which is an important pro-inflammatory molecule [33]. However, we did not
observe any mutation in the active sites and zinc finger motif, attributing normal catalytic
activity of nsp3. The general opinion is that SARS-CoV PL-PRO domain is important for the
development of antiviral drugs and of the actual role of this enzyme in the biogenesis of the
COVID-19 replicase complex is yet not explored. It is proposed that the proteins nsp3, nsp4 and
nsp6, through their transmembrane domains, are involved in the replicative and transcription
complex [34]. In our study, we observed only 3 UMs in nsp4 and nsp6, respectively.
Meanwhile, nsp5 encodes 3C-like proteinase which

cleaves the C-terminus of replicase

polyprotein at 11 sites. The five UMs that we found in nsp5 did not fall in its active sites (3304
and 3408 in ORF1ab) requiring further investigation with large number of sequence datasets.

4. Conclusion:
The present global outbreak of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has already taken ~0.8
million lives. To combat this deadly disease, we need a greater understanding of the

pathobiology of the virus. Hence, it is essential to minimize the translational gap between viral
genomic information and its clinical consequences for developing effective therapeutic
strategies. In this study, we have attempted to explore genomic variations of Bangladeshi SARSCoV-2 viral isolates while comparing with a large cohort of global isolates. Our analyses will
facilitate the understanding of the origin, mutation patterns and their possible effect on viral
pathogenicity. This study tries to address the importance of the variations in the viral genomes
and their necessity for therapeutic interventions. The unique insights from this study will
undoubtedly be supportive for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 molecular mechanism and
to draw an end to the current life-threatening pandemic.

Figure legends:
Figure 1: Phylogenetic analysis of 207 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 genomes with 467
representative sequences from 42 different countries worldwide. Sequences from Bangladesh are
annotated with ‘green circles’ in the tree and D614G mutations cluster is ‘shaded green’. Outside
the main tree there are four different annotation panels sequentially to show the presence of
D614G mutations as binary data (G614 as Red Star), followed by GISAID clades as a ‘color
strip’, district-wise distribution of Bangladeshi sequences in a ‘shape plot ‘and finally burden of
mutation in different ORFs of SARS-CoV-2 in the outermost panel as ‘heatmap’.

Figure 2: District-wise distribution of GISAID clades among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in
Bangladesh. Please be noted that district information of 18 sequences out of 207 deposited from
Bangladesh is not available from respective metadata. The spatial map was created using layers
downloaded from GeoDASH (The Bangladesh Geospatial Data Sharing Platform) website on
ArcGIS Desktop (Esri Inc.,109 Redlands, California, United States) licensed to King’s College
London.
