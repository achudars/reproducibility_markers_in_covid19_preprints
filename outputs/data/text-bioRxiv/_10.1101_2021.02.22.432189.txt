Abstract.

16

The recent rise in mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2, especially with changes in the

17

Spike protein, is of significant concern due to the potential ability for these mutations to

18

increase viral infectivity, virulence and/or ability to escape protective antibodies. Here,

19

we investigated genetic variations in a 414-583 amino acid region of the Spike protein,

20

partially encompassing the ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD), across a subset of

21

570 nasopharyngeal samples isolated between April 2020 and February 2021, from

22

Washington, California, Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois. We found that

23

samples isolated since November have an increased number of amino acid mutations in

24

the region, with L452R being the dominant mutation. This mutation is associated with a

25

recently discovered CAL.20C viral variant from clade 20C, lineage B.1.429, that since

26

November-December 2020 is associated with multiple outbreaks and is undergoing

27

massive expansion across California. In some samples, however, we found a distinct

28

L452R-carrying variant of the virus that, upon detailed analysis of the GISAID database

29

genomes, is also circulating primarily in California, but emerged even more recently.

30

The newly identified variant derives from the clade 20A (lineage B.1.232) and is named

31

CAL.20A. We also found that the SARS-CoV-2 strain that caused the only recorded

32

case of infection in an ape - gorillas in the San Diego Zoo, reported in January 2021 - is

33

CAL.20A. In contrast to CAL.20C that carries two additional to L452R mutations in the

34

Spike protein, L452R is the only mutation found in CAL.20A. According to the

35

phylogenetic analysis, however, emergence of CAL.20C was also specifically triggered

36

by acquisition of the L452R mutation. Further analysis of GISAID-deposited genomes

37

revealed that several independent L452R-carrying lineages have recently emerged

38

across the globe, with over 90% of the isolates reported between December 2020 -

39

February 2021. Taken together, these results indicate that the L452R mutation alone is

40

of significant adaptive value to SARS-CoV-2 and, apparently, the positive selection for

41

this mutation became particularly strong only recently, possibly reflecting viral

42

adaptation to the containment measures or increasing population immunity. While the

43

functional impact of L452R has not yet been extensively evaluated, leucine-452 is

44

positioned in the receptor-binding motif of RBD, in the interface of direct contact with the

45

ACE2 receptor. Its replacement with arginine is predicted to result in both a much

46

stronger binding to the receptor and escape from neutralizing antibodies. If true, this in

47

turn might lead to significantly increased infectivity of the L452R variants, warranting

48

their close surveillance and in-depth functional studies.

49

Introduction

50

The recent emergence of mutational variants of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV) around the globe

51

suggests adaptive evolution of the virus, potentially affecting its transmissibility,

52

infectivity, virulence and/or immune escape [1-4]. The primary target of current vaccines

53

and monoclonal antibodies is the Spike protein which mediates viral attachment to and

54

entry into host cells [5, 6]. Thus, emergence of variants with mutations in the Spike

55

protein are of particular interest due to their potential for reduced susceptibility to

56

neutralizing antibodies elicited by vaccination or prior infection.

57

The Spike protein is 1,273 amino acids long and is comprised of the N-terminal region

58

S1 (amino acids 14-682) responsible for viral attachment to target cells via the ACE2

59

receptor, and the C-terminal region S2 (aa 686–1273) responsible for membrane fusion

60

and cell entry [7]. Before fusion, S1 is cleaved from S2 in the cleavage region (aa 682-

61

685). Antibodies against the ACE2 binding domain of S1 (Receptor-Binding Domain,

62

RBD; aa 319-541) are considered to be critical in neutralizing nCoV [8-10]. Because of

63

the important functional and antigenic properties of RBD, structural changes in this

64

domain deserve special attention and have already been highlighted by such notorious

65

RBD mutations as E484K (e.g. found in the ‘Brazil’ variant B.1.1.28) or N501Y (found in

66

the ‘British’ B.1.1.7 variant and ‘South African’ B.1.351 variant) [1].

67

We evaluated the feasibility of determining mutational changes in the S1 region by PCR

68

amplification of 541 bases fragment within and immediately downstream from the RBD

69

coding region, followed by Sanger sequencing (see Methods). The amplicon included

70

the gene region coding aa 414 to 583 of the Spike protein (for further: ‘region 414-583’),

71

which includes the so-called receptor-binding ridge epitope (aa 417, 455, 456 and 470–

72

490), the 443–450 loop epitope (aa 443–452 and 494–501) and the 570-572 loop of the

73

so-called C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1) of S1, which is important in the interaction

74

between the S1 and S2 regions. As test samples, we used 570 clinical oropharyngeal

75

specimens collected during April-May from nCoV-positive patients at Kaiser

76

Permanente Washington (51 samples) and nCoV-positive clinical samples submitted for

77

testing to IEH Laboratories, Inc. (Bothell, WA), from four states (California, Washington,

78

Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois) that were split into a September-October

79

collection group (85 samples) and a November-February collection group (434

80

samples). In the process of region 414-583 analysis, we noted a high prevalence of

81

samples that carried nCoV variants with L452R mutation. This prompted us to perform

82

an in-depth follow-up analysis of the L452R-carring nCoV strains in our samples and,

83

then, their prevalence and clonal origin on the global scale by using publicly available

84

nCoV genomes and analytical tools of GISAID and Nextstrain databases.

85

Results

86

It was possible to amplify the 414-583 region and obtain high quality sequence from

87

99.8% of the specimens. A total of 58 of the samples had 1 to 2 changes from the

88

corresponding region of the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (NC_045512). All

89

sequence changes in the region were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Among

90

the April-May samples, only one sample (2.0%) was found with a mutation. This

91

mutation was of silent (synonymous) nature, i. e. without the change in amino acid

92

content (Table 1). Among the September-October samples, four samples (4.7%) had

93

single SNPs, including three silent mutations and one amino acid (nonsynonymous)

94

mutation. Among the November-February samples, 53 (12.2%) had a total of 15 silent

95

SNPs and 11 amino acid (nonsynonymous) mutations. Among the later samples, all

96

multiple samples tested at the IEH Laboratories that were known to have been isolated

97

from the same patient or submitted from the same collection site on the same day had

98

the same mutational profiles and were considered as epidemiologically linked and

99

considered as duplicated. Upon removal of the duplicates, 39 non-linked samples

100

contained mutations in the 414-583 region, with 27 unique SNPs or SNP combinations.

101

Silent mutations were distributed across the 414-583 region, without clear clustering

102

(Figure 1). In contrast, the amino acid changes were distributed non-randomly and,

103

except for one mutation (P463S), were clustered within the main epitope regions of

104

RBD (L452R, T470N, T478K, G482V, E484K and S494P) or in the 570-572 loop of

105

CTD1 (A570V and T572I). All of the amino acid mutations had been reported previously

106

and could be identified in nCoV sequences deposited to GISAID. Though the notorious

107

N501Y mutation was not identified in our samples, five samples contained mutation

108

E484K that is found in lineages from various countries and present in the ‘Brazil’ variant

109

B.1.1.28. E484K is located in the receptor-binding ridge epitope and was shown to

110

provide marked resistance to neutralizing antibodies in multiple studies [8, 11, 12].

111

The most frequent mutation found in the region 414-583 was by far L452R, occurring in

112

19 out of 39 (48.7%) total and 13 out of 26 (50.0%) non-linked samples, isolated in 9 out

113

of 18 (50%) separate collection sites. Three samples with L452R also had separate

114

silent changes and two samples (from the same site) had an additional amino acid

115

change T572I. L452R was found mostly in samples (14) and sites (6) from California,

116

though 5 samples from 3 sites came from Washington. L452R is part of the 443-450

117

loop epitope and is located on the edge of the receptor-binding motif of RBD formed by

118

residues in direct contact with ACE2 [8, 13, 14]. Its occurrence appeared to be only

119

sporadic in most of 2020 and has received significant attention only very recently due to

120

the report of the California Department of Public Health released January 17, 2021 and

121

a follow-up publication [15]. It was noted that there has been a recent sharp rise in

122

isolation of nCoV variants with L452R across multiple outbreaks in California,

123

accounting for more than a third of all isolates. According to the GISAID database, only

124

six nCoV genomes with L452R were deposited in September-October 2020 (all from

125

California), but since then additional genomes with the mutation have been deposited

126

including 142 in November (95.7% from California), 488 in December (79.1%) and 619

127

in January 2021 (69.2%). This expansion has been linked to a single viral variant from

128

clade 20C according to the Nextstrain nomenclature of nCoV (lineage B.1.429

129

according to the PANGO nomenclature of nCoV) and was designated as CAL.20C

130

(20C/S:452R; B.1.429).

131

According to genomic analysis, CAL.20C has also been defined by 4 additional amino

132

acid mutations, including two Spike protein mutations, S13I and W152C, located in the

133

signal peptide and N-terminal domain, respectively [15]. Using an approach similar to

134

our sequencing of the region 414-583, we amplified and sequenced the aa1-250 coding

135

region in all samples with the L452R mutation. Both S13I and W152C mutations were

136

found in 15 total (11 non-linked) samples suggesting their identity with CAL.20C.

137

(Among those samples, one contained an additional silent mutation, while in two

138

samples from one site a four-amino acid deletion (141-144 LGVY) was found.)

139

Surprisingly, in 4 samples with L452R the additional mutations were absent. Those

140

samples originated from two separate sites (two samples in each) in California. One

141

sample pair carried the T572I mutation in the 414-583 region mentioned above. To

142

determine how closely these S13I/W152C non-carrier L452R variants were related to

143

the CAL.20C variant, full genome sequencing was possible performed on three of those

144

samples and on four CAL.20C-like, S13I/W152C carrier samples. Based on the

145

genome-wide analysis, all CAL.20C-like variants were in the same clade as the chosen

146

reference CAL.20C strain (GISAID # 730092) isolated in September, 2020 (Figure 2A).

147

In sharp contrast, the other L452R variants formed a distinct phylogenetic clade that is

148

distant from CAL.20C, sharing none of the CAL.20C-specific mutations. In fact, further

149

analysis established that those strains derived from a separate 20A clade, lineage

150

B.1.232, indicating that the L452R mutation in this group of strains was acquired

151

independently from CAL.20C. To distinguish from the recently described CAL.20C

152

variant, we designated this novel L452R-carrying variant as CAL.20A

153

(20A/S:452R/B.1.232).

154

Analysis of the GISAID database on February 19, 2021, revealed that the CAL.20A-

155

including lineage B.1.232 contained a total of 559 deposited genomes, but only 54 of

156

them (9.7%) contained the L452R mutation, all closely related to the CAL.20A strains

157

identified here. The first deposition of an CAL.20A genome was made on November 23,

158

2020, from Baja California, Mexico (GISAID # 878300), with most of the CAL.20A

159

genomes deposited in January-February 2021 (43 genomes; 79.6%). The vast majority

160

of CAL.20A strains (74%) were isolated in the state of California, but also in 5 other

161

states (WI, NM, UT, PA, AZ) as well as Canada, Mexico and Costa-Rica. Interestingly,

162

one of the CAL.20A samples was derived from a gorilla in the San Diego Zoo

163

(deposited to GISAID January 10; GISAID # 862722) – a highly publicized case of nCoV

164

infection in apes [16].

165

To compare the clonal diversity of CAL.20A and CAL.20C strains, we build a

166

phylogenetic tree of the January isolates of CAL.20A and 50 randomly selected

167

genomes of CAL.20C also deposited in January 2021. We also included into the

168

analysis some strains that we have identified as the most closely related to the L452R

169

variants, but without this mutation. Based on the shorter branches overall, the CAL.20A

170

cluster appeared to be less diverse than the CAL.20C cluster (Figure 2B). The pairwise

171

difference in the number of silent, presumably neutrally accumulating mutations per

172

genome was 2.56±1.41 and 8.22±4.19 mutations, respectively (P<.01), indicating that

173

CAL.20A has emerged much more recently than CAL.20C.

174

In contrast to CAL.20C, L452R was the only omnipresent amino acid mutation in the

175

Spike protein of CAL.20A, relatively to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain. Other

176

mutations, like T572I in our samples, were found only sporadically and in few strains

177

(with most mutations in the S2 region). In fact, L452R was the only amino acid mutation

178

in the entire genome that separated CAL.20A from the closest non-L452R strains within

179

the B.1.232 lineage (GISAID # 636127, Figure 2B). Thus, acquisition of L452R appears

180

to be the primary evolutionary event that led to emergence of CAL.20A. Though it was

181

originally reported that, besides L452R, all CAL.20C strains carry 4 more specific amino

182

acid mutations, including S13I and W152C in the Spike protein, we found that few

183

closely related strains in the B.1.429 lineage carry either S13I alone (GISAID # 977963)

184

or both S13I and W152 but not L542R (GISAID # 847642 and # 977918, Figure 2B).

185

Thus, the Spike mutations in the CAL.20C-contaning lineage were acquired sequentially

186

with the L452R acquired most recently, triggering the current massive clonal expansion

187

of CAL.20C.

188

Examination of the Nextstrain and GISAID databases on February 18, 2021, revealed

189

that, besides CAL.20A and CAL.20C, there are a total of 410 nCoV genomes that

190

contain the L452R mutation which has been acquired by at least 5 separate lineages –

191

A.21, A.2.4, B.1.1.10, B.1.1.130 and C.16 within different clades, ranging from 2 to 213

192

strains each (Figure 3). The strains were isolated from over 20 countries across all

193

continents, with no apparent dominance of any geographic area. In one deposited

194

strain, from lineage B.1.74, an L452Q mutation was present instead of L452R. There is

195

a clear temporal trend in the number of deposited genomes, with 2 genomes only from

196

July-September, 28 from October-November, 127 from December 2020 and 238 from

197

January 2021. Thus, the L452R mutation has been acquired independently in a variety

198

of clonally diverse nCoV strains, with 92.6% of L452R strains reported after November

199

2020, indicating a very recent emergence of all those lineages.

200

Discussion

201

Taken together, our results show that two independent nCoV variants recently emerged

202

in the state of California that carry the L452R mutation in the Spike protein, the already

203

defined and currently dominant CAL.20C [15] as well as the more recently emerged

204

CAL.20A identified here. The fact that, according to our analysis, emergence of both

205

CAL.20A and CAL.20C was triggered by the L452R mutation alone provides direct

206

evidence for the adaptive significance of this mutation specifically and, also, creates a

207

potential opportunity to isolate and functionally compare naturally occurring isogenic

208

variants of nCoV with and without L452R.

209

On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of other mutations specific to CAL.20A or

210

shared with CAL.20C could be the reason why the former variant has not undergone as

211

extensive expansion as CAL.20C. This would indicate (and availability of CAL.20A

212

should help to affirm) that other mutations in CAL.20C might enhance the adaptive

213

impact of L452R, i.e. that the genomic background of L542R plays a significant role as

214

the target of positive selection. However, it is also possible that CAL.20A is at least as fit

215

as CAL.20C, but has not expanded as broadly because it emerged much more recently

216

and after CAL.20C has underwent extensive expansion in the same geographic niche

217

area. Co-circulation of CAL.20A and CAL.20C in the same area provides a unique

218

opportunity to study the interplay between variants in space and time in

219

demographically diverse but interconnected communities and patient populations.

220

According to the public databases, in addition to the two California strains the L452R

221

mutation has been acquired at this point by at least half a dozen independent lineages

222

across multiple countries and continents. Though detailed examination of the timing,

223

geography and genomic background of L452R emergence in different lineages is

8

224

beyond the scope of this study, such repeatedly emerging hot-spot mutations typically

225

indicate strong positive selection. Interestingly, it appears that the selection for L452R

226

became especially strong very recently. This is possibly reflecting adaptive evolution of

227

the virus in response to either the epidemiological containment measures extensively

228

introduced in the fall of 2020 or a growing proportion of the population with immunity to

229

the original viral variants, i.e. the reconvalescents and vaccinated individuals.

230

Though potentially an accidental event, isolation of CAL.20A from a gorilla at the San

231

Diego Zoo is worthy of note. According to the sequence deposited in GISAID, the gorilla

232

CAL.20A variant carries two additional SNPs, both in the ORF1ab non-structural protein

233

2 (nsp2), a silent c934t and non-synonymous c810t (T183I), but with several sequence

234

stretches unfortunately missing. It is impossible to say at this point to what extent the

235

isolation of the CAL.20A variant is connected to possibly distinctive biological properties

236

of the strain and specifically the L452R mutation. However, it would be valuable to

237

determine whether the occurrence of CAL.20A infection in the gorilla is due to specific

238

features of CAL.20A with regard to viral transmissibility, infectivity or virulence.

239

Despite mounting evidence for the adaptive value of L452R, the exact functional or

240

structural effect of the mutation and its impact on viral immunogenicity, pathogenesis,

241

infectivity and/or transmissibility remains to be determined. Due to only recent attention

242

to L452R variants, relatively few studies investigated the potential effects of this

243

mutation. It was found that L452R reduces the Spike protein reactivity with a panel of

244

the virus neutralizing antibodies and sera from convalescent patients [8, 14]. Moreover,

245

it was found that out of 52 naturally occurring mutations in the receptor-binding motif

246

residues of RBD that form the interface of direct interaction with ACE2, L452R results in

247

the largest increase in free energy of the RBD-ACE2 binding complex, predicting

248

stronger virus-cell attachment and, thus, increased infectivity [13]. We hope that the

249

current and the original report on L452R variants of nCoV will facilitate in-depth

250

structure-functional studies of the leucine residue in position 452 position and the

251

change of hydrophobic leucine to a polar, highly hydrophilic arginine (or glutamine).

252

We cannot exclude the possibility of sample collection bias in our study as it was not

253

originally designed as an in-depth surveillance study in specific geographical regions. In

254

addition, our analysis is limited to a relatively small set of samples in hand and to

255

publicly available genomes. However, we believe that the identification of CAL.20A and

256

CAL.20C, with both common and unique features relative to the other circulating nCoV

257

variant, will be useful in the optimization of real-time monitoring and the more complete

258

understanding of the biological properties of this pandemic virus with a recently

259

expanding number of genetic variations that are cause for significant public concern.

METHODS

336

Sample collection

337

Random de-identified nasopharyngeal samples were provided either as original swabs

338

by Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA, April - May 2020, greater Seattle area) or

339

as purified RNA by IEH Laboratories and Consulting group (September 2020 –

340

February 2021, multiple states). Samples that tested positive for the presence of SARS-

341

CoV-2 RNA (according to the respective laboratory practices) were subjected to further

342

analysis. IEH samples of interest (see below) were assigned a unique identifier based

343

on their collection date and source; information regarding the state of origin was

344

provided for these samples for epidemiological analysis. Protected health information

345

was completely removed from all clinical results before they were given to the

346

researchers. All subjects cannot be identified directly or indirectly. The Western

347

Institutional Review Board (Puyallup, WA) provided institutional biosafety committee

348

services to Institute for Environmental Health by approving consent forms and human

349

research safety protocols.

350

RNA isolation and SARS-Cov-2 testing

351

RNA from KPWA samples was isolated using both AllPrep DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen) and

352

MagMax Viral Pathogen RNA isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to

353

manufacturer’s procedure. RNA isolation from IEH samples was performed according to

354

laboratory guidelines using Thermofisher Kingfisher-96 instrument and proprietary IEH

355

Nucleic Acid Extraction Reagent Kit. RNA was stored at -20oC until use. Testing of RNA

356

for the presence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA at KPWA and IEH was performed according to

357

laboratory guidelines using CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time

358

Reverse Transcriptase (RT)–PCR Diagnostic panel and proprietary IEH SARS-CoV-2

359

RT-PCR Test kit (based on the CDC RT-PCR kit), respectively.

Amplification and sequencing of 414-583 and 1-250 regions

361

To amplify the 414-583 RBD region of the Spike gene from SARS-Coc-2 RNA samples,

362

we used both one-step RT-PCR and two-step (cDNA synthesis followed by separate

363

PCR amplification) reaction designs with commercial One-Step Ahead RT-PCR Kit

364

(Qiagen) or IEH in-house RT, PCR and RT-PCR kits according to manufacturer’s

365

guidelines. Both kits and conditions yield non-distinguishable results. Primers to amplify

366

the region were as following: PF, 5’- GTGACATAGTGTAGGCAATGATG-3’, PR, 5’-

367

TGGTGTAATGTCAAGAATCTCAAG-3’. First round of PCR (either RT-PCR on RNA or

368

PCR on cDNA) consisted of 40 cycles of 10 sec 95oC, 15 sec 57oC, 40 sec 72oC. The

369

product was then diluted 1:50 times with sterile water, and a second round of PCR was

370

performed for 15 cycles at the same conditions using T7-tailed nested primers to obtain

371

a single pure product (PF-T7Pro-nested, 5’-

372

TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAAACTGGAAAGATTGC-3’, PR-T7Term-nested, 5’-

373

GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGCTCAAGTGTCTGTG-3’). Similarly, 1-250 Spike protein

374

region was amplified firstly using primers PF2, 5’-

375

CAGAGTTGTTATTTCTAGTGATGTTC-3’ and PR2, 5’-

376

TGAAGAAGAATCACCAGGAGTC-3’, followed by the nested PCR on 1:50 diluted

377

samples with tailed primers PF-T7Pro, 5’-

378

TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAGAGTTGTTATTTCTAGTGATGTTC-3’, and PR-

379

T7Term-nested2, 5’-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGGAGTCAAATAACTTC-3’. Sanger

380

sequencing of the amplified region was performed from both ends by Eton Bioscience,

381

Inc. Sequences were analyzed using BioEdit 7.2 and MEGA 7 Software.

382

Whole genome sequencing

383

WGS was performed by IEH on MiSeq Illumina instrument; each sample was subjected

384

to two individual rounds of sequencing. Sequences were assembled de novo using

385

proprietary IEH pipeline or using the PATRICK sequence assembly service

386

(https://patricbrc.org/app/Assembly2).

388

The latest global analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the Nextstrain database

389

(https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global) was used to determine viral strains with the presence

390

of L452 substitutions in the Spike protein (as of 12/17/2021). All genome sequences

391

from PANGO lineages A.2.4, A.21, B.1.1.10, B.1.1.74. B.1.1.130, B.1.232, B.1.429,

392

C.16 were downloaded from GISAID database (https://www.epicov.org/epi3, as of

393

12/17/2021). Sequences were checked for the presence of Spike-L452 substitution(s).

394

All L452R-containing sequences submitted in January-February 2021 for lineages

395

B.1.232 (CAL.20A) and 50 randomly chosen B.1.429 (CAL.20C) as well as the closely

396

related L452 ancestors from both lineages were aligned and used to build total and

397

synonymous-only phylogenetic trees using MEGA 7 software. Deletions of stretches of

398

nucleotides which resulted in in-frame codon deletions were treated as single event.

399

Unresolved nucleotides were assigned nucleotide value based on the closest relative.

400

The same L452R sequences were used to run pairwise comparisons for synonymous

401

substitutions for each CAL.20A and CAL20.C lineage separately and to calculate the

402

average pairwise differences in silent mutations.

403

Statistical analysis

404

Distribution of synonymous (S) and non-synonymous (NS) mutations within the 414-583

405

fragment was compared for RBD ridge epitope residues (aa 417, 443-452, 455-456,

406

470-490, 497—501, 570-572, total N = 49) vs other regions (N = 169) in McNemar test.

407

There were 6 vs 1 NS and 7 and 8 S mutations, respectively, resulting in McNemar Chi2

408

4.50 (P = .034).
