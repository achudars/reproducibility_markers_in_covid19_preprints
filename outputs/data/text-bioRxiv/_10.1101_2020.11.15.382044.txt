ABSTRACT
The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for virus entry into human cells. In fact, most neutralizing antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 are directed against the Spike, making it the antigen of choice for use in vaccines and
diagnostic tests. In the current pandemic context, global demand for Spike proteins has rapidly increased and could
exceed hundreds of grams to kilograms annually. Coronavirus Spikes are large, heavily glycosylated, homotrimeric complexes, with inherent instability. Their poor manufacturability now threatens availability of these
proteins for vaccines and diagnostic tests. Here, we outline a scalable, GMP-compliant, chemically defined process
for production of a cell secreted, stabilized form of the trimeric Spike protein. The process is chemically defined
and based on clonal, suspension-CHO cell populations and on protein purification via a two-step, scalable downstream process. The trimeric conformation was confirmed using electron microscopy and HPLC analysis. Binding
to susceptible cells was shown using a virus-inhibition assay. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for
detection of serum SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG1 was investigated and found to exceed that of Spike fragments (S1
and RBD). The process described here will enable production of sufficient high-quality trimeric Spike protein to
meet the global demand for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and diagnostic tests.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; trimeric Spike; CHO cells; manufacturability; vaccines; diagnostics.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the 2019
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic [1, 2] which presents an unprecedented challenge to societies globally.
Effective vaccines and sensitive diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are urgently needed, and systems to produce and
deliver these tools in sufficient quantities are required. It has become clear that contemporary protein production
technologies for Spike proteins are insufficient to meet the unprecedented global demand for critical ingredients.
As the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike complex is a major target of the immune system, it could be a useful ingredient
for vaccine and diagnostic applications. Stabilized trimeric Spike proteins have been selected as antigen of choice
for RNA and virus-vector based vaccine candidates that are currently under development (Moderna, Novavax,

Pfizer, J&J etc.). The efficacy of these vaccines is hoped or predicted to be between 50 and 70%. To boost the
immune response, it is likely that follow-up vaccinations will be required. An adjuvated, highly purified subunit
vaccine based on the stabilized trimeric Spike protein could be ideal for this purpose. Subunit vaccines can be
produced in a cost-effective way and can be transported and stored lyophilized at ambient temperature. Also,
whether any vaccination approach has elicited a sufficiently protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2
and the perpetuity of the immune response needs to be verified. To address this, the quantification of antibody
levels against SARS-CoV-2 in serum is the most practical approach. For this reason, there will be a high demand
for diagnostic tests for quantification of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The antigen which provides the best
sensitivity and specificity for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is the trimeric form of the Spike protein [3].
The viral Spike (S) protein complex is a surface-exposed homo-trimeric structure that mediates entry into
host cells. The Spike engages the cellular host receptor ACE2 and mediates virus-host membrane fusion. It is
critical in the viral replication cycle and thus the Spike complex is considered the primary target of neutralizing
antibodies [4-7]. The ideal diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies would detect all antibodies directed against
the trimeric S protein complex. Production of such diagnostic tests implies the production of large quantities of
highly purified S protein similar to its natural prefusion conformation [8]. The coronavirus Spike protein is a
heavily glycosylated complex, with inherent structural flexibility and instability. In addition, the S protein is
processed by Furin and the membrane-bound protease TMPRSS2 [6, 8]. Poor yield and pre-fusion instability of
the S protein have hampered its use for development of vaccines and diagnostic tests. We explored the
manufacturability of trimeric S protein in a secreted, soluble form using widely applied Chinese Hamster Ovary
(CHO) cells. We developed a process that produces high quality S trimer protein for diagnostic tests as well as for
vaccine applications. We used the fully characterized and CMC-compliant CHOExpress™ cell host (ExcellGene
SA), single use equipment, chemically defined media and additives. Also, regulatory requirements from DNA
construction to production in bioreactors were strictly followed. The clonally derived cell line and the scalable
production process outlined here, will allow manufacture of trimeric S protein in grams and even kilograms, should
the demand rise to such a level.

2. Material and Methods
2.1. Design of SARS CoV-2 Spike proteins
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein encoding DNA were constructed and codon-optimized for CHO cells according
to manufacturer recommendations (https://www.excellgene.com). A total of 11 DNA constructions were designed
(Figure 1) and synthetized by ATUM (Menlo Park, USA). An IgG leader sequence was added to mediate efficient
signal peptide cleavage. Histidine (8mer) encoding DNA was added for carboxyterminal expression. Where
mentioned, the furin cleavage site RRAR is mutated to be non-functional. The transmembrane domain and the C
terminal intracellular tail were removed and replaced by a T4 foldon sequence [9] in trimer designs. For the RBDfragment (aa319-541) IgG leader and His-tag sequences were added. After appearance in infected patients of the
D614G mutation in Spike proteins of the virus, this mutation was also incorporated into the chosen best construct.
2.2 Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
Manufacturer’s protocols were followed for transfection and culturing of CHOExpress™ cells (ExcellGene
SA, Monthey). An optimized transfection reagent mix (CHO4Tx®, ExcellGene SA) was used to transfect cells in
animal-component free media with the vector pXLG-6 (ExcellGene SA) containing SARS-CoV-2 Spike DNA
sequences, driven by promoter/enhancer sequences and associated elements. The vector includes an expression

cassette for a puromycin resistance maker. Supernatants of high-density transient transfections under suspension
culture were harvested after 10 days, mimicking a fed-batch process with ExcellGene’s animal component-free
and protein-free CHO4Tx® PM (production medium) in 50 mL TubeSpin® bioreactor 50 tubes (TPP,
Trasadingen, Switzerland). Cultures were shaken in a humidified ISF1-X/ISF3-X shaker (Kuhner, Birsfelden,
Switzerland). Cultures were shifted from 37ºC to 31ºC during the production phase. Supernatants
Recombinant CHO cell lines: After transfections, suspension cells were stringently selected with puromycin.
Resulting stable pools of recombinant CHO cells with satisfying yields were kept. Clonal cell lines were obtained
by image-assisted cell distribution into single wells of 96 well plates (f-sight, Cytena GmbH, Freiburg). Expanded
cell populations with high level expression for expected trimers and RDB monomers were frozen in mini-banks.
Both, a recombinant pool cell line for the RBD Spike fragment and the lead clonal cell line for the Spike trimer
were used for scale-up in an optimized fed-batch process at the 0.2 L, 10 L and 50 L bioreactor scale of operation.
The basic production medium employed EX-CELL® Advanced™ CHO Fed-batch medium (Merck-Sigma).
Bioreactors were seeded at 5x105 cells/mL at 37ºC. On day 4 the cell culture was shifted to 31º C, and animal
component free 7a and 7b feeds (HyClone Cell Boost, Cytiva) were used according to an ExcellGene optimized
procedure. Production culture fluids were harvested, clarified and subjected to purification by affinity
chromatography after pumping them through layered (5 µm, 0.6µm, 0.2 µm) harvest filters (Cytiva, Ultrapure) to
remove cells. Loading onto, washing of and elution from a Ni-Sepharose column (Cytiva) were optimized,
following the resin producers’ suggestions. The eluted product stream was loaded on a Size-Exclusion column
(SEC, Superdex 200 pg, Cytiva) for further purification, following a tangential flow filtration with a cut-off of
100’000 Dalton for the S trimer product. This step was omitted for the RBD fragment.
2.3. Electronmicroscopy analysis of Trimeric Spikes
Frozen aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer (Wuhan) and D614G mutant S trimer were thawed and purified
by size exclusion chromatography (Superose 6 Increase 10/300, GE Healthcare) using 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM
NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) NaN3. Elution fractions containing S trimer were collected and diluted to 0.05 mg/mL.
Samples were deposited onto plasma-cleaned, carbon-coated copper grids (CF400 mesh, Electron Microscopy
Sciences), and stained in 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate at pH 7.0. Grids were imaged at a resolution of 92.000X in a
Talos F200C transmission electron microscope equipped with a Ceta 16M detector (ThermoFisher Scientific). The
pixel size was 1.63 Å. Contrast transfer function estimation and particle picking were performed in cisTEM [16].
Extracted particles were exported to cryoSPARC-v2 (Structura Biotechnology Inc.) for 2D classification, ab initio
3D reconstruction and homogeneous refinement. Three-fold symmetry (C3) was imposed during the final round
of refinement.
2.4. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by SARS-CoV-2 proteins
Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI of 0.01) was mixed with cell culture medium containing two-fold serial
dilutions of RBD or trimeric Spike, ranging in concentration from 240 µM to 0.244 µM. This mixture was
inoculated onto Vero E6 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and at 48 hours post infection, SARS-CoV-2
infection was visualized using virus nucleocapsid antigen specific staining (red) and by a cell nucleus specific
staining (blue), as described in [10]. Quantification of fluorescence was done as described [11].

2.5. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using SARS-CoV-2 proteins
A bead-based serological assay [11] was used. Patient sera were collected and reacted with commercially available
S-RBD and monomeric S1 domain protein, as well as S trimer and RBD. Briefly, 11ug of S-RBD (Sino Biologics,
40592-V08H), RBD (ExcellGene), monomeric Spike S1 (Sino Biologics, 40591-V08H) or S Trimer (ExcellGene),
were loaded on 100 µL of Microplex fluorescent beads and reacted with IgG containing sera. Relative optical
readings were taken for each protein specific assay using the control sera and the COVID 19 sera. The relative
reading for individual samples ranged from 0.01 AU/mL to about 1000 AU/mL. The sensitivity and specificity of
the assay for each of the tested proteins was plotted in a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Design and selection of CHO manufacturable SARS CoV-2 Trimeric Spikes
In order to define the optimal construct design to produce a soluble trimeric Spike protein we evaluated the
expression with various S protein-variants (Figure 1) by CHO transient expression. The transmembrane domain
and the C terminal intracellular tail were removed and replaced by a T4 foldon DNA sequence [9] with or without
(GGGS)n linker and a 8xHis tag encoding DNA. The furin cleavage site RRAR is mutated to be non-functional.
WT Spike and amino-acid mutations K986P/V987P (“2P”) for locking the protein into a prefusion conformation
[12] were also used. In addition, a receptor binding domain truncation of the S trimer was used (RBD-His). S
proteins variants with a scrambled furin cleavage site were found better expressed. Mutation of the furin cleavage
site seemed to increase trimer assembly and/or stability, suggesting that trimer assembly via T4 foldon occurs in
the Golgi (Trans-Golgi network where furin is active). The same construct modifications were also applied for the
D614G mutation in the Spike protein which has recently replaced to a large extent the Wuhan version.

3.2. CHO expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins
Stable recombinant cell pools expressing S trimer and RBD were generated using puromycin selection. From
a total of 300 clonally derived cell populations, those with the highest expression levels of S trimer and RBD were
expanded and a fed-batch production process was developed. Cell culture process conditions, such as medium
formulations, feeds, feed and temperature shift timing were evaluated at 10mL scale in TPP® TubeSpin 50
bioreactor tubes as previously described [13, 14]. Optimal conditions were selected on the basis of product yield,
product quality, viable cell density (VCD) and cell viability. The production process was scaled up to 200 mL
shake flasks, to 10 L and to 40 L stirred tank bioreactors (STR). Viable cell density (VCD) and viability remained
high for at least 10 days (Figure 2). In addition, viable cell density (VCD) and viability profiles were comparable
between shake flasks, 10L and 40L STRs, indicating process scalability. From ExcellGene’s experience in
developing high-yielding manufacturing processes for clinically relevant recombinant antibodies and other
proteins since almost 20 years, there is high confidence to assure feasibility to any scale of operation, up and
beyond the 2000 Liter scale. Krammer [15] rightly points to expression and scale-up difficulties for production
large and complex proteins in global SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such as the S trimer. However, since the mid 1980s
CHO cells have delivered hundreds of kilograms and tons of proteins from bioreactors at scales of up to 20’000 L
[16]. One leading subunit vaccine candidate similar to the one presented here includes the transmembrane region
of the Spike trimeric protein and is produced and purified from Baculovirus infected insect cells (SF-9). To the
knowledge of the authors, this technology has not been scaled up to any scale larger than 100 L. This vaccine may
face a serious manufacturability issue, when intended for global use. Also, insect cells present a different
glycosylation pattern on proteins (pauci-manosidic, alpha 1-3 fucose) than mammalian cell systems [17]. One
could argue that a manufacturing system with more human like glycosylation patterns could be a superior vaccine,
since it mimics more closely the authentic protein. This is particularly important since each Spike monomer has 9
predicted N- and 3 O-glycosylation sites [18] that reveal the polypeptide backbone for potential antigenic epitopes
only at a part of its surface [19].

(%) are shown at various scales of operation for both S trimer (a) and RBD (b).

3.3. Molecular characterization and electron microscopy analysis of Trimeric Spikes
S trimer and RBD from cell-free culture supernatant were purified using an immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (IMAC) capture step followed by preparative size exclusion. Eluates were concentrated and
formulated at 1mg/mL in PBS pH7.4. Purity of the final products was estimated to be over 95% as analyzed by
HPLC-SEC (Figure 3 a and b).
HPLC-SEC (non-denaturing conditions) indicates that the S protein complex is trimeric (about 460 kDa) and
the RBD is monomeric. The expected size of 150-160 kDa and 29 kDa for the Spike and RBD monomers,
respectively, were confirmed by reducing SDS-PAGE (Figure 3 c, d). The heavy glycosylation of S-trimer
contributes significantly to size heterogeneity, as has been seen with other CHO cell produced virus derived
proteins, such as truncated surface proteins from Ebola and HIV. Presently ongoing work will characterize the
glycosylation of the S-trimer from the CHO cell process. Trimeric confirmation was also confirmed using
negative-stain electron microscopy (Figure 3 e - h).

3.4. Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by SARS-CoV-2 proteins
SARS-CoV-2 virus was mixed with serially diluted RBD or Spike trimer and the mixture was inoculated on
Vero E6 cells. 48 hours later, SARS-CoV-2 infection was visualized and quantified (Figure 4 a and b). The
presence of both the RBD Spike fragment and Spike trimer reduced infection of Vero cells. For RBD, reduction
of infectivity was observed at a concentration of 20 µM and higher. For the S trimer (both Wuhan and D614G), a
near 100-fold lower concentration reduced infection (Figure 4 b). Taken together, these results show that CHOproduced trimeric S and RBD are able to compete with SARS-CoV-2 for binding to host cells. No differences
were observed between the 614D (Wuhan) and the D614G variants of the Spike trimer.

3.5. Sensitivity and specificity of SARS CoV-2 Spike proteins for detection of antibodies
The trimeric Spike and RBD proteins were used to detect SARS-CoV-2–specific IgG in a semi-quantitative
bead-based serological assay [10]. We specifically selected a set of COVID-19 serum samples that cover a large
range of SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody concentrations. Sera (n = 72) were collected from PCR-confirmed nonhospitalized (n = 63) and hospitalized (n = 9) COVID-19 patients between days 4 and 40 after disease onset.
Control sera (n = 79) were collected before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 from patients with seasonal coronainduced Influenza-like illness (n = 44), non-corona, Influenza-like illness (n = 29), and from healthy individuals
(n = 6).

Figure 5. Performance of RBD, monomeric S1 and S trimer in a diagnostic assay to identify COVID-19 patients. (a) Control
sera (n = 151) and COVID-19 sera (n = 72) collected at day 4-40 of symptoms were tested and compared for concentrations of
IgG. Median concentration and 95% confidence intervals are shown. (b) The sera tested in (a) were analyzed by ROC.
Abbreviations: AU, arbitrary unit; RBD, receptor binding domain; ROC, receiver operator characteristic; S1, Spike protein
subunit 1.

For all proteins, the median signal intensity for the COVID samples was over 400-fold higher than for the control
samples (Figure 5 a). Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis (Figure 5 b) showed that trimeric Spike
(both Wuhan and D614G) provided higher test-sensitivity and higher specificity characteristics compared to both
S1 monomer and commercial RBD produced in HEK293 (p = 0.03; 0.04), and RBD produced in CHO (p = 0.05).
Statistical analysis [20, 21] showed no differences between the ROC of S1 monomer and both RBD’s, neither
compared to Wuhan nor to D614G trimeric Spikes. Taken together, our results indicate that CHO-produced
Trimeric Spike can deliver higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity than S1 monomer and RBD. These
observations are in-line with previous reports [3].

4. Conclusion
Using an optimized CHO expression system, and a scalable, chemically defined production process, trimeric
SARS CoV-2 Spike proteins with mammalian-type glycosylation could be provided in sufficient quantities.
Analysis of the resulting protein shows that it is of high purity and trimeric. Functional analysis showed it to be
efficient in blocking virus infectivity in an in-vitro model. In addition diagnostic performance of the trimeric Spike
for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG was shown to exceed that of RDB and monomeric S1 protein.
