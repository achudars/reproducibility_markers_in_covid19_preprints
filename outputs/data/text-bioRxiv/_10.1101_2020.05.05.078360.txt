Abstract:

10

Excessive cytokine signalling frequently exacerbates lung tissue damage during respiratory
viral infection. Type I and III interferons (IFN-α/β and IFN-λ) are host-produced antiviral
cytokines and currently considered as COVID-19 therapy. Prolonged IFN-α/β responses can lead
to harmful proinflammatory effects, whereas IFN-λ mainly signals in epithelia, inducing localised
antiviral immunity. Here we show that IFN signalling interferes with lung repair during influenza
recovery, with IFN-λ driving these effects most potently. IFN-induced p53 directly reduces
epithelial proliferation and differentiation, increasing disease severity and susceptibility to
bacterial superinfections. Hence, excessive or prolonged IFN-production aggravates viral infection
by impairing lung epithelial regeneration. Therefore, timing and duration are critical parameters
of endogenous IFN action, and should be considered carefully for IFN therapeutic strategies
against viral infections like influenza and COVID-19.

During infection with respiratory viruses, disease severity is linked to the destruction of
epithelia in the lung. This occurs as a result of both cytopathic viral effects in host cells, and
damage generated by the ensuing inflammatory immune response. Loss of airway and lung
epithelia can result in clinical complications, including lung failure, acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfections by
pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) owing to a loss of epithelial barrier
function.
Restoration of damaged epithelial tissues is therefore paramount in order to maintain lung
function and barrier protection. The lung epithelium is largely quiescent during steady state, yet
has a remarkable capacity to replenish following damage. Several types of progenitor cells can
contribute to the regeneration of the respiratory epithelium. Trp63+Krt5+ basal cells in the upper
airways and Scgb1a1+ secretory cells in conducting airways repopulate epithelial cell populations
following depletion in mice (1, 2). Surfactant producing type II alveolar cells (AT2) cells
proliferate to reform damaged alveoli, whilst also functioning as stem cells through the
differentiation into type I alveolar cells (AT1) (3, 4). In situations of severe damage, including
influenza virus-induced injury, alveolar repair is supported by the emergence and expansion of
Krt5+ basal cells from the airways (5–8).
Interferons (IFNs) represent a crucial component of the innate immune defence against
viral infections. Type I and III IFNs (IFN-α/β and IFN-λ, respectively) are induced upon viral
recognition, and function by triggering transcription of an overlapping set of interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs), conferring an antiviral state in infected and bystander cells (9, 10). Owing to
widespread expression of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) in immune cells, IFN-α/β responses
can result in immunopathology during viral infections, including influenza virus and severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (11–14). In contrast, the receptor for IFN-λ
(IFNLR) is restricted mainly to epithelia at barrier sites like the gut and lung, with expression in
the immune system largely restricted to neutrophils in mice (15–17). IFN-λ responses are therefore
often characterised by their ability to confer localised antiviral protection at the site of infection,
without driving damaging proinflammatory responses associated with IFN-α/β. Both type I and III
IFNs are currently being tested in clinical trials as antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 (18–
20), despite some scepticism owing to IFN-α/β-associated pathogenic effects (21). In addition to
their antiviral and proinflammatory activity, IFNs exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic
functions, and have a long history in antitumour therapies (22). Despite a growing understanding
of the causes of immunopathology during infection with respiratory viruses, little is known
concerning the direct effect that IFN responses have on lung epithelial repair.

Temporal overlap of antiviral IFN responses and lung epithelial repair following influenza
virus infection
To induce acute lung damage, C57BL/6 (B6) wild type (WT) mice were infected with a
sublethal dose of the H3N2 influenza virus strain X31. Influenza virus matrix gene expression
peaked on day 2 post infection following viral replication, before viral clearance was reached on
day 12 post infection (fig. S1A). Infection resulted in increasing morbidity and weight loss (fig.
S1B), accompanied by significant immune cell infiltration and lung damage as determined by
histology (fig. S1C, left, and S1D). Recovery from infection (~day 8 post infection; fig. S1B)
coincided with the onset of epithelial regeneration (fig. S1C, right). To further investigate the
dynamics of lung repair following influenza virus infection, epithelial cells were harvested for
analysis of proliferation by flow cytometry, using the marker of recent cell proliferation Ki67
(gating strategy in fig. S2). During steady-state conditions, type II alveolar epithelial cells (AT2;
EpCam+MHCII+CD49flow) (3, 4, 23) have a low rate of turnover, remaining largely quiescent (Fig.
1A). However, following influenza virus-induced lung damage, AT2 cells undergo rapid
proliferation starting at ~day 7 post infection, correlating with mouse recovery and weight gain of
mice (Fig. 1A and fig. S1B).
To compare the dynamics of epithelial recovery with production of IFN in our infection
model, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) at different timepoints throughout
influenza virus infection (Fig. 1B). IFN subtypes (IFN-α, -β and -λ) were produced rapidly,
peaking on day 2 post infection (Fig. 1B). The magnitude of IFN-λ production was significantly
greater than that of IFN-α/β, both in concentration and duration. Whilst IFN-α/β production
declined following the day 2 peak, high levels of IFN-λ production were maintained. Importantly,
only IFN-λ was detected on day 7/8 post infection, coinciding with the onset of epithelial recovery
(Fig. 1A and B). Together, these data show that following influenza virus infection, IFN signalling
(in particular IFN-λ induced) is ongoing throughout the onset of epithelial proliferation and lung
repair.
IFN signalling during recovery from influenza virus infection impairs lung epithelial cell
proliferation
Next, to understand the effect of IFNs on lung epithelial repair, mice were treated with IFN
during recovery from influenza virus infection (day 7 to 10 post infection) (fig. S3A). To compare
the effects of type I and III IFN subtypes at equal biological potency, IFN-α, -β and -λ subtypes
were titrated on murine airway epithelial cell (AEC) cultures and analysed for the induction of
antiviral ISGs (fig. S4A). Dose-response curves were then generated to obtain an EC50 for each
subtype, in order to determine a conversion factor for equipotency between IFN-α, -β and -λ (fig.

S4B). In order to study the effects of IFN treatment specifically on epithelial cells, we generated
irradiation bone marrow (BM) chimeras where WT recipient mice were given Ifnar1-/- bone
marrow cells, thus restricting IFNAR expression to the stromal compartment.
In chimeric mice, both IFN-α and -β treatments significantly reduced the proliferation of
AT2 cells on day 11 post influenza virus infection, compared to PBS treated control mice (Fig.
1C). This reduction was independent of changes in viral burden, as influenza virus matrix gene
expression remained unchanged following IFN treatment (fig. S3B). We also observed a reduction
in the proliferation of AT2 cells in WT mice following IFN-λ treatment (Fig. 1B), again
independently from changes in viral load (fig. S3C). To exclude the possibility of IFN-λ signalling
in neutrophils, we treated WT mice with a monoclonal antibody against Ly6G (clone 1A8) (fig.
S3D). Even after depletion of neutrophils, we observed a significant reduction in AT2 cell
proliferation following IFN-λ treatment (fig. S3E). A caveat when using inbred mouse strains in
the context of influenza virus infection is the lack of a functional Mx1 protein; a crucial IFNinducible influenza virus restriction factor in both mice and humans (24). We therefore infected
mice that express functional Mx1 alleles (B6-Mx1) with the highly virulent influenza virus strain
hvPR8-DNS1, for a more clinically relevant influenza model. IFN-λ treatment also significantly

20

reduced lung epithelial proliferation in the presence of functional Mx1 (Fig. 1E).
We next sought to determine the role of endogenous IFN during lung repair, using Ifnar1/and Ifnlr1-/- mice. AT2 cells were analysed on day 8 post influenza virus infection; the time of
overlap between IFN signalling and epithelial cell proliferation (Fig. 1A and B). Both Ifnar1-/- and
Ifnlr1-/- mice had improved AT2 cell proliferation, compared to WT controls (Fig. 1F and G). This
was dependent on IFN signalling specifically through the epithelium, as receptor deficiency in the
stromal compartment alone was sufficient to increase lung epithelial cell proliferation (Fig. 1H).
Improved proliferation was independent of major changes in viral burden, with only a slight
increase in influenza virus matrix gene expression observed in Ifnar1-/- mice on day 2 post
infection, and no change in Ifnlr1-/- mice, compared to WT controls (fig. S5A). Viral control in
individual IFN receptor knockout mice is likely unaffected due to redundancy between type I and
III IFN antiviral responses in epithelial cells (25, 26).
Despite type I and III IFN redundancy in viral control (fig. S5A), the lack of redundancy
in antiproliferative IFN responses, with both Ifnar1-/- and Ifnlr1-/- mice displaying enhanced
epithelial proliferation (Fig. 1F to H), led us to further interrogate the phenotype. As IFNAR
signalling has previously been shown to be important for the production of IFN-λ during influenza
virus infection (27, 28), we measured IFN production in the BALF of IFN receptor knockout mice.
Consistent with previous findings (28), we observed a significant reduction in IFN-λ (and indeed
IFN-α/β) production in Ifnar1-/- mice compared to WT, yet we saw little change in IFN-α/β levels
in Ifnlr1-/- mice (fig. S5B). These findings suggest that the improved epithelial proliferation

observed in Ifnar1-/- mice, could be attributed to a reduction in IFN-λ. Reduced IFN production in
Ifnar1-/- mice is linked with steady state priming defects in these mice owing to the absence of
tonic IFNAR activation in immune cells (29). To circumvent this, we used an αIFNAR monoclonal
antibody during influenza virus infection (MAR1-5A3) administered only from the time of
infection (day 0). αIFNAR treatment maintained steady state priming required for IFN-λ
production (fig. S5C), yet was effective in reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines
induced by IFN-α/β (fig. S5D) (12). Importantly, αIFNAR treatment from day 0 or day 3 post
infection, had no effect on lung epithelial cell proliferation (fig. S5D). We therefore conclude that
in our model of influenza virus infection in B6 mice, IFN-λ responses are most effective in
disrupting epithelial regeneration during influenza recovery, and these effects are mediated
directly in epithelial cells.
Type I and III IFNs block AEC proliferation and differentiation
To understand mechanistically how IFNs exert the antiproliferative effects observed in
vivo, we set up primary murine AEC cultures. Progenitor basal cells from distal airway sites are
involved in the regeneration of the lung epithelium following influenza virus-induced damage (6,
8, 30). AEC cultures undergo rapid proliferation, and also differentiation upon exposure to an airliquid interface (ALI), recapitulating repair processes observed in the lung and airway epithelium
following damage in vivo (31, 32). Similar to IFNs used in vivo, IFNs used for in vitro assays were
titrated on AEC cultures, to compare IFN subtypes at equivalent biological potency (fig. S6A and
B). AEC cultures seeded at a low density in the presence of IFN-β or -λ were unable to reach
confluence, whilst IFN-α treatment significantly reduced AEC number and the time taken for
cultures to reach confluence (Fig. 2A left, and fig. S7A).
To study growth inhibitory effects of IFNs without blocking the establishment of AEC
cultures, we seeded cells at a higher density before treating with IFN for 5 days. All 3 IFN subtypes
delayed the time taken for cultures to reach confluency, and impaired cell growth, with IFN-β and
IFN-λ having the most significant effects (Fig. 2A right, and 2B). Growth inhibitory effects are
dependent on the presence of the respective IFN receptor (fig. S7B). Similar effects were observed
when primary human AEC cultures were treated with equivalent doses of IFN types (fig. S6C and
D), with human IFN-β and -λ treatment resulting in the most significant decrease in cell number
(Fig. 2C).
To gain mechanistic insight into IFN-mediated disruption of AEC growth, we analysed
IFN treated AEC cultures by flow cytometry to study effects on apoptosis and proliferation.
Consistent with the observed reduction in cell number, IFN-β or -λ treatment resulted in a
significant increase in the frequency of apoptotic or necrotic cells (Annexin V+/TO-PRO-3+) (fig.
S7C and D). We also observed a more than 50% reduction in the number of actively proliferating

cells, as measured by incorporation of the thymidine analogue EdU, while IFN-α treatment had
only a modest effect (Fig. 2D and E). These findings were confirmed by measuring CFSE dilution
(fig. S7E and F, left). Interestingly, IFN-mediated antiproliferative effects were only observed in
highly proliferative AEC cultures, as treating established cultures had no effect (fig. S7E to G,
right). These data suggest that IFNs actively disrupt cell cycle progression without killing
quiescent cells. Therefore, the increase in apoptosis observed (fig. S7C and D) may occur as a
result of failed progression through the cell cycle following IFN treatment, as seen previously (33).
We next sought to examine the effects of IFNs on AEC differentiation. Following acute
damage, populations of basal cells and Scgb1a1+ secretory cells give rise to secretory and
multiciliated cell subtypes (34). Timely repopulation of airway epithelial cell subsets following
damage is crucial in maintaining barrier function. Indeed, influenza virus infection has previously
been shown to decrease mucociliary clearance in mice, resulting in an increased susceptibility to
superinfection with S. pneumoniae (35). To study specific effects of IFNs on AEC differentiation,
we initiated IFN treatment later during the course of AEC growth throughout exposure to an ALI,
the time in which AEC differentiation is induced (fig. S8A). Similar to our findings for
proliferation, IFN-β and -λ treatment significantly reduced the expression of genes pertaining to
multiciliated (Mcidas/Ccno) and secretory cell (Muc5AC, Scb1a1) differentiation, with IFN-λ
having the strongest effect (Fig. 2F). Expression of the basal cell marker Krt5 remained unchanged,
or increased by IFN-λ treatment, suggesting maintenance of stemness (fig. S8B). We also observed
a significant reduction in the number of ciliated cells in AEC cultures (acetylated α-tubulin+)
following IFN-λ treatment, but not with IFN-α or -β (Fig. 2G and fig. S8C). To confirm these
findings in vivo, WT and Ifnlr1-/- mice were infected with influenza virus, and lung sections were
analysed by immunofluorescence. Ifnlr1-/- mice had increased acetylated α-tubulin+ ciliated cells
in repairing conducting airways on day 10 post infection (Fig. 2H). We quantified these findings
by flow cytometry, and observed an increase in the frequency of differentiated AECs
(EpCamhighCD49fhighCD24+) composed of ciliated, goblet and club cells (Fig. 2I and fig. S2)(5).
From these results, we conclude that IFN-λ signalling reduces the capacity for basal cell
differentiation during recovery from influenza virus infection.
IFNs disrupt AEC growth via induction of p53-dependent downstream pathways
To understand mechanistically how IFNs mediate antiproliferative effects, we performed
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on IFN-treated AEC cultures (Fig. 3A). Principal component
analysis (PCA) showed that untreated AEC control samples clustered depending on length of
culture growth (including ALI exposure) along the principal component 2 (PC2), indicating that
this axis represents proliferation and differentiation (Fig. 3B). AECs treated with IFN subtypes for
4 hours of culture clustered away from their respective mock on PC1, suggesting this principal

component of variance (46%) is attributable to induction of antiviral ISGs (Fig. 3B). Additionally,
4-hour IFN treatment clustered samples together regardless of subtype (Fig. 3B), confirming the
equal subtype dosage based on previous titrations (fig. S6A, B, and S9A).
AECs were also treated for 2, 3, or 5 days to understand the effects of prolonged IFN
treatment in growing AEC cultures. 4-hour and 5-day IFN treated cultures shared the same
experiment endpoint, and therefore share the same untreated controls (Fig. 3A). 5 days of IFN-β
or -λ treatment, resulted in the clustering of samples away from corresponding untreated controls
on both PC1 and PC2, indicating maintained ISG induction (PC1) and a block of AEC proliferation
and development (PC2) (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the response induced by IFN-α was significantly
reduced after just 2 days of treatment, consistent with previous findings (36). Ingenuity pathway
analysis (IPA) of differentially expressed genes following prolonged IFN treatment (2, 3 and 5
days) revealed the top cluster pertaining to biological pathways regulating cell cycle and cell death,
most significantly induced by IFN-λ treatment across all timepoints (Fig. 3C). Predicted upstream
transcriptional regulators identified typical regulators of IFN function, including interferon
regulatory factors (IRFs) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, in
addition to regulators of cell cycle (Fig. 3D). We identified the tumour suppressor protein p53 as
a top candidate regulating IFN-inducible antiproliferative effects, owing to its significant predicted
activity following prolonged IFN-β and -λ treatment in AECs (Fig. 3D). Additionally, gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed IFN-mediated induction of the p53 downstream pathway
and p53-regulated downstream targets (fig. S9B and C).
To confirm the role of p53, we utilised p53-/- AEC cultures. IFN treatment had no effect on
p53-/- AEC number or proliferation following IFN treatment (Fig. 3E and F). IFN-mediated
induction of antiproliferative downstream p53 target genes Gadd45g and Dusp5 (37, 38) was p53
dependent, as IFNs had no such effect in p53-/- AEC cultures (Fig. 3G). Additionally, IFN-λ had a
much-reduced negative effect on multiciliogenesis in differentiating p53-/- cultures, compared to
its effect on WT and p53+/- cultures (fig. S9D). We next sought to examine whether IFNs regulate
p53 activity in epithelial cells during lung repair in vivo. To study IFN effects specifically in the
lung epithelium, we once again generated Ifnar1-/-> WT bone marrow chimeric mice for IFN-α or
–β treatment, or depleted neutrophils in WT mice with αLy6G for IFN-λ treatment (fig. S3A). In
agreement with in vitro observations, IFN-β and -λ, but not IFN-α, significantly upregulated p53
expression in repairing lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3H and I). Taken together, these results
demonstrate that IFN-β and -λ mediate antiproliferative effects in AECs via induction of p53.
Additionally, our RNA-seq analyses confirm the potent antiproliferative activity of IFN-λ,
compared to type I IFN subtypes.

Ifnlr1-/- mice have improved epithelial repair and barrier function following influenza virus
infection
Our data supports a significant role for IFN signalling, in particular IFN-λ, in the reduction
of epithelial proliferation and differentiation during lung repair. We therefore determined whether
this alters the state of lung epithelia or affects barrier function of the respiratory epithelium. RNAseq analysis of sorted influenza virus infected lung epithelial cells (EpCam+CD31-CD45-) from
WT or Ifnlr1-/- mice confirmed an upregulation of pathways pertaining to proliferation and
multiciliogenesis in Ifnlr1-/- mice (Fig. 4A). Improved repair correlated with reduced lung damage,
with a reduction in both the total, and red blood cell number in the BALF of Ifnlr1-/- mice day 8
post infection (Fig. 4B and C). Additionally, Ifnlr1-/- mice had less inflammatory immune cell
infiltrate dispersed in lung tissues (Fig. 4D). Influenza virus infections in humans are often
exacerbated by opportunistic bacterial pathogen, including S. pneumoniae (39). A contributing
factor driving this synergy, is a compromised epithelial barrier as a result of influenza virusinduced damage. To measure the effects of IFN-λ signalling on lung barrier function, we
challenged mice with S. pneumoniae 8 days post influenza virus infection. We used BM chimeric
mice to study specific effects of IFN-λ in epithelial cells. Mice lacking IFNLR in the stromal
compartment (WT > Ifnlr1-/-) had improved survival following bacterial superinfection (Fig. 4E).
Overall, our data indicate that IFN-λ signalling reduces the capacity for epithelial repair following
influenza virus infection, which results in prolonged lung damage and compromised barrier
function, consequently increasing susceptibility to bacterial superinfection.
Discussion
Here we describe a novel mechanism by which type I and III IFN signalling aggravates
lung pathology during respiratory viral infection. By focusing on the importance of epithelial
repair during the recovery phase of infection, we highlight the potential for both IFN-α/β and IFNλ in exacerbating influenza disease.
Our data indicates that IFN-λ is most effective in disrupting lung epithelial repair. Specific
blockade of type I IFN responses with αIFNAR-treatment had no effect on lung epithelial
proliferation. Comparison of IFN subtypes at equal biological potency in AECs revealed IFN-β
and -λ to most significantly disrupt growth and induce antiproliferative pathways in primary
human and murine epithelial cell cultures. Factors that determine the antiproliferative differential
of IFN subtypes include: ligand-receptor binding affinity, length of stimulation, receptor density,
and negative feedback control (40–45). Additionally, we found the magnitude of IFN-λ production
in BALF was greater compared to IFN-α/β, extending into the crucial time window in which
epithelial repair manifests post influenza virus infection. We therefore conclude that the reduced
antiproliferative potential of IFN-α, combined with low IFN-α/β levels in vivo, limits the capacity

for type I IFNs to block lung repair directly in B6 mice. However, we do not exclude a potential
for host IFN-α/β production in directly blocking lung epithelial repair. This may be the case in
situations of excessive type I IFN production and lung pathology, as seen in other mouse strains
following influenza virus or SARS-CoV infection (12, 13).
Mechanistically, we identified the tumour suppressor protein p53 as the downstream
regulator of IFN-induced antiproliferative effects. Research defining the mechanisms by which
IFNs induce growth inhibitory effects have focused on type I IFNs, using transformed cell lines to
explore antitumour therapeutics, with little understanding for their roles in normal physiology or
during infection (22). In primary AECs, we observed no difference between WT and p53-/- cultures
in baseline growth or expression of downstream effector genes (including Gadd45g and Dusp5),
indicating that p53 is inactive in these cells under normal conditions. Once activated, p53 triggers
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through induction of its target genes (46), and has previously been
shown to directly regulate IFN-αβ antitumour and antiviral responses (47).
We also show that IFN-λ disrupts AEC differentiation during lung repair. The
differentiation of AEC cultures triggered by air exposure is accompanied by reduced cell
proliferation. As we treated cultures specifically during this period, the block in differentiation
appears to be independent of antiproliferative IFN effects. Multiciliogenesis in AECs requires
tightly coordinated use of the mitotic machinery for centriole amplification, required for the
generation of cilia (48). We therefore speculate that IFN-induced p53 activity disrupts this
coordination, thereby impairing AEC differentiation. Respiratory virus infections are associated
with chronic lung disease such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (49), and
proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to induce epithelial remodelling in human AECs
(50). Therefore, our data suggest a mechanistic link between antiviral immune responses and longterm changes in lung physiology.
Pathogenic respiratory viruses, including IAV and CoV, are a significant global health
concern owing to their potential to cause pandemics. The ongoing outbreak of CoV disease 2019
(COVID-19) presents the most severe global health crisis since the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918
(51–53). Similar to influenza, severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with massive alveolar
damage and progressive respiratory failure (54), and SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to induce
expression type I and III IFNs in primary human AEC cultures (55). In addition, histopathological
findings in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 victims reveal neutrophilic infiltration
consistent with superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia (56) . Causes of variation in host
disease severity during respiratory virus infection are not well understood. Studies comparing
influenza patient cohorts found little or no correlation between disease severity and viral load (57–
60), suggesting a role for genetically determined host factors, including mechanisms amplifying
immunopathology.

Attempts to gain a better understanding of human influenza pathogenesis have largely been
restricted to whole blood expression analysis (61–63), and therefore exclude localised immune and
epithelial repair responses in lung tissues (64). However, macaques infected with the highly
virulent 1918 H1N1 strain, revealed an elevated ISG signature late during infection bronchial
tissue (65). Additionally, SARS-CoV patients displayed robust IFN responses, and aberrant ISG
expression in severe cases (66). Whether susceptible individuals display excessive IFN responses
late during infection, and the potential impact this has on lung repair, remains to be determined.
Our transcriptomic analyses of regenerating epithelial cells in vivo link host IFN-λ responses with
a reduction in the capacity for lung repair. Analysis of lung tissue and BALF from respiratory virus
infected patients experiencing severe disease will provide insight into the mechanisms regulating
disease pathogenesis, including potential interplay between IFNs and epithelial cells.
Lack of an available vaccine during the emergence of novel zoonotic viruses, like SARSCoV-2, highlights the importance of generating and implementing effective host-directed antiviral
and immunomodulatory treatments. Our data highlights the importance of a well-timed IFN
response, with regards to both host immunity and exogenous treatment. IFN-α/β treatment
exacerbates inflammation and disease severity in mice if administered past the peak of viral
replication during influenza virus or Middle East respiratory-syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV)
infection (67, 68). IFN-λ treatment early during influenza virus infection was shown to be
protective, owing to its ability to confer antiviral protection without generating the
proinflammatory responses associated with IFN-α/β (68, 69). For these reasons, IFN-λ is therefore
being implemented as a candidate therapy for COVID-19 (70). However, our findings here identify
a mechanism by which IFN-λ exacerbates respiratory virus disease acting specifically through the
respiratory epithelium, independent of immunomodulation.
Taken together, these data indicate the necessity for effective regulation of host IFN
responses, and the importance of timing and duration when considering IFNs as therapeutic
strategies to treat respiratory virus infections. Optimal protection would be achieved by strong
induction of ISGs early during infection to curb viral replication, followed by timely
downregulation of IFN responses, enabling efficient lung epithelial repair. These data change our
understanding of immunopathology during viral infection, and have important implications for
IFN usage as antiviral therapy.

conditions). Confluence was determined by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER;
>1000Ω = confluent cultures). (B, D and E) Proliferating mouse AEC cultures (2 days prior to
exposure to an ALI) were treated for 5 days with IFNs (day -2 ALI to day 3 post ALI), and effects
on growth were determined by cell number (B) (n = 9) and EdU incorporation to measure
proliferation (D and E) (n = 9). (C) Primary human AEC cultures were treated with IFNs for 5
days, and cells were counted (n = 4 to 6). (F and G) Mouse AECs were grown to confluence, then
exposed to an air-liquid interface (ALI) for 2 days. IFNs were then administrated for 6 days during
ALI exposure (n = 6 for all conditions). Differentiation was determined by mRNA expression of
the indicated genes (F) and the level of acetylated α-tubulin staining in cultures (G). (H and I) WT
and Ifnlr1-/- mice were infected with influenza virus, and lungs were analysed by
immunofluorescence (DAPI/acetylated α-tubulin) on day 10 post infection (n = 4) (H), and flow
cytometry (EpCam+CD49fhighCD24+) on day 14 post infection (n = 3) (I). All data are
representative of at least three independent experiments. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. and
statistical significance was assessed by one-way (B, C, E and G) or two-way (F and I) ANOVA
with Dunnett’s post-test. ns, not significant (P >0.05); *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P

Heatmap for significant differences in ‘Canonical Pathways’ for 9 pairwise comparisons between
indicated IFN treatment and the respective mock, at each time point (fold change > 1.5, one-way
ANOVA with Benjamini–Hochberg correction, P < 0.05), Gene expression was compared using
IPA Comparison Analysis. (D) Predicted upstream transcriptional regulators of differentially
expressed genes (IPA analysis). (E to G) WT and p53-/- AECs were treated with IFN subtypes for
5 days, and measured for growth by cell number (E), CFSE dilution (F), and mRNA expression of
indicated genes (G) (n = 3 for all conditions). (H and I) Ifnar1-/- > WT BM chimeric mice (H) (n
= 4 to 5) and α-Ly6G treated mice (I) (n = 4) infected with influenza virus (X31), and treated with
IFN every 24 hours consecutively for 4 days (day 7 to 10 post infection), before
EpCam+MHCII+CD49flow AT2 cells were analysed for p53 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) on
day 11 post infection by flow cytometry. All data are representative of at least two independent
experiments (E to I). Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. and statistical significance was assessed
by two-way (E to G) or one-way (H) ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test, or unpaired two-tailed
Student’s t-test (I). ns, not significant (P >0.05); *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001, ****P ≤
