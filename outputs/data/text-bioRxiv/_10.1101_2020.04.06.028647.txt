Novel SARS-Cov-2 enters human cells via interaction between
the surface spike (S) glycoprotein and the cellular membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using a combination of comparative structural analyses of the binding surface
of the S protein to ACE2, docking experiments, and molecular
dynamics simulations we computationally identified a minimal,
stable fragment of ACE2. This fragment binds to the S protein,
is soluble, and appears not to bind to the physiological ligand
angiotensinII. These results suggest a possible use of the ACE2
fragment as a decoy that could interfere with viral binding by
competition.

Introduction
The entry of the novel SARS-Cov-2 into the host cell is mediated by the interaction between the viral transmembrane
spike (S) glycoprotein and the cellular membrane receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1). The S glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor of about 1,300 amino
acids that is then cleaved into an amino N-terminal S1 subunit of about 700 amino acids and a carboxyl C-terminal S2
subunit of about 600 amino acids. Three S1-S2 heterodimers
assemble to form a trimer protruding from the viral surface.
The S1 subunit contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD),
while the S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion peptide.
Upon receptor binding, the S1 subunit is cleaved, and the fusion S2 subunit undergoes a conformational rearrangement to
form a six-helix bundle that mediates viral and cellular membrane fusion (2).
The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related carboxypeptidase, ACE2, is a type I integral membrane protein of about 805 amino acids that contains one HEXXH +
E zinc-binding consensus sequence. ACE2 is a close homolog of the somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE;
EC 3.4.15.1), a peptidyl dipeptidase that plays an important role in the renin-angiotensin system. ACE2 sequence
includes an N-terminal signal sequence (amino acids 1 to
18), a potential transmembrane domain (amino acids 740
to 763), and a potential metalloprotease zinc-binding site
(amino acids 374 to 378, HEMGH). The internal cavity hosts
the angiotensinI substrate (consisting of aminoacids 1 to 10
of the angiotensinogen precursor) that ACE2 converts into
angiotensinII (amino acids 1 to 8) (3, 4). ACE2 is expressed
mainly in heart, kidney, testis, smooth muscle, and in coronary vessels and it seems to increase in lately differentiated

epithelial tissues (5). The expression of ACE2 seems inversely regulated by the expression levels of ACE, a key regulator of blood pressure and the target of the pharmacological
ACE inhibitors that control blood pressure (6).
X-ray and cryo-EM structures of complexes between the
viral S protein from different Coronaviruses both alone and
in complex with ACE2 have been solved (7–11). Here we
analyzed the crystallographic and cryo-Electron Microscopy
(cryo-EM) structures of the S-proteins from SARS-Cov
and SARS-Cov-2, human ACE2, and their complexes. We
studied the structural features of the binding of ACE2 to
S-protein, and performed molecular docking experiments
in order to determine the interaction energy between the S
protein and ACE2 residues.
We identified a minimal ACE2 fragment consisting of two
α-helices that retains most of the key interactions with the S
protein without interfering with its physiological ligand angiotensinII. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations we
confirmed that the peptide remains stable in complex with
the S-protein. Further, the peptide appears to be stable in
an aqueous environment. We conclude by highlighting the
potential therapeutic applications of this peptide in terms of
scalability, lack of toxicity and immunogenicity, possible administration routes, and potential applications in diagnostic
tests.

Results
Structural determinants of ACE2 receptor binding to
the SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov S-protein. Using the co-

ordinates of the recently solved structure of the complex
(pdb:6VW1), we determined the per-residue interaction energies between the human ACE2 protein and the SARS-Cov2 S-protein to ACE2 with RosettaDock (12, 13). The results are shown in Figure 1A and 1B, where we highlight the
key residues involved in binding. Table 1 lists the interacting amino acids between the human receptor ACE2 and viral
proteins from SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov. In addition, we
also report the interaction energy values between SARS-Cov2 and ACE2 computed with RosettaDock.
We also compared complexes of ACE2 bound to the C terminal RBD of viral S-protein from SARS-Cov-2 (pdb:6VW1)
and SARS-Cov (pdb:2AJF) using structural superposition,
since these complexes are structurally very similar (Figure
1C). To rule out crystal packing artifacts, we also superimposed the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-Cov complex
(pdb:6ACK) onto the crystal structures. We used the coorRenzi et al.

Fig. 1. Structural analysis of viral S-proteins binding to ACE2. Panels A and B highlight the ACE2 residues that are involved in binding to the SARS-Cov-2 S-protein. The
residues are colored by interaction energy as predicted by RosettaDock (red: interaction energy < -1 Rosetta Energy Units (REU); yellow: -1 REU < interaction energy <
0). Panel C shows a superposition of SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 in complex with ACE2, while Panel D shows NL63-Cov S-protein in complex with ACE2.

dinates of the S-protein in the pre-fusion conformation (conformation 3 with CTD1 open at 111.6º, which is the physiological state when the S protein binds to the ACE2 receptor). The comparison of the crystal and EM structures did not
show evident deviations in the tertiary or secondary structure
in regions corresponding to the S-protein binding site (not
shown).
In addition, we compared the complex of another coronavirus, Cov-NL63 (pdb:3KBH), which targets the ACE2 receptor as well. The structure of Cov-NL63 shows limited
structural similarity in binding to ACE2 as compared to other
SARS viruses (Fig.1D). Cov-NL63 appears to bind to a narrower area of ACE2, centered around Lys353, which interacts
with the conserved viral Tyr498.
The amino acids of the SARS-Cov-2 S-protein involved
in binding to ACE2 span a poorly structured region from
Leu455 to Tyr505, which correspond to the Tyr442-Tyr491
region in SARS-Cov.
The amino acids in the human ACE2 receptor involved in viral protein binding span two back-to-back helices, α-helices
1 and 2, from Ser19 to Tyr83. Based on the per-residue
energy breakdown obtained with RosettaDock, this area
contributes almost 90 percent to the total interaction energy.
An additional, point-wise binding feature is represented by
Lys353 located in the connecting loop of a downstream beta2

hairpin. Lys353 is anchored to the N-terminal ACE2 helix
by Tyr41 and Asp38, and it contributes almost 10 percent of
the total interaction energy. An additional small downstream
helix contributes negligibly to the total binding energy.
In addition, we compared these structural binding determinants with the results of mutagenesis experiments performed
by Wong et al. on a SARS-Cov fragment of 193 aminoacids,
corresponding to residues 318-510 of the full S-protein (14).
Of the two loops encompassing aa 452-454 and aa 434-437
in SARS-Cov-2 (corresponding to aa 460-469 and 447-450
in SARS-Cov and shown to be important in the binding to
ACE2), only the first comes into contact with Lys31. The
second loop is quite far away from the binding surface (not
shown), and its involvement in binding might be indirect,
probably affecting the folding of the viral protein fragment.
The ACE2 fragment remains stable in complex with
the viral S-protein and is stable in an aqueous environment. In addition to the interaction energy calculations,

the comparative structural analyses discussed above suggest
that most ACE2 key residues involved in S-protein binding
are found on the N-terminal back-to-back α-helices 1 and 2.
To determine whether the two helices do in fact remain stable
in complex with the S-protein, we performed a 100 ns MD
simulation of this complex. We visually inspected the trajectory and computed the root mean square deviation (RMSD)

Table 1. Interaction energy breakdown for ACE2 residues in complex with SARS-Cov2. The interaction energy values were computed with RosettaDock. ACE2
residues are color-coded as in Figure 2, with red for residues with an interaction energy < -1 and yellow for residues with an interaction energy between 0 and -1. The
corresponding residues in SARS-Cov (as determined by structural superposition with SARS-Cov-2) are included as well.

over time with respect to the energy-minimized initial conformer (Figure 2A, green curve). Based on these results,
we concluded that the double-helix in complex with the Sprotein is stable.
Further, we determined whether the double-helix is stable in
an aqueous environment in the absence of the S-protein, a
feature that would be required for a viable inhibitor. We carried out a 100 ns MD simulation of the double-helix alone,
visually inspected the trajectory, and compared the RMSD
with respect to the initial conformer (Figure 2A, black curve).
In addition, we also computed the fraction of residues that
remain in α-helix conformation over time (Figure 2B, black
curve). The results of this analysis indicate that the double
helix is stable in an aqueous environment.
We also compared the stability of the double-helix against
that of α-helix 1. As shown in Figures 2A and 2B (blue
curves), the single helix is substantially less stable than the
double-helix, with almost half of the residues losing the αhelical conformation over time.

ACE2 fragment as a decoy

ACE2 fragment does not appear to interfere with the
physiological ligand angiotensinII. To determine whether

the double-helix fragment has the potential to bind to angiontensinII, possibly interfering with that physiological system,
we performed docking of angiotensinII to ACE2 (Figure 3).
As shown by the docking results, the angiotensinII binding
site is located in an internal cavity of the receptor, quite far
from the surface where the viral S-protein binds. Most of
the residues of ACE2 involved in binding to angiotensinII
are internal to the core of the protein. Only two amino acids
(Asp51 and Ser47) in α-helix 1 have appreciable interactions
with angiotensinII, and contribute about 15 percent of the total interaction energy as predicted by RosettaDock.
These results suggest that the double-helix fragment is highly
unlikely to interfere with angiotensinII in a physiological
context.

By performing comparative structural analyses, molecular
docking, and molecular dynamics simulations we identified
the key residues that are involved in the binding between the
viral S-protein and the human ACE2 receptor. These key

residues are found in the two N-terminal back-to-back helices 1 and 2, spanning about 60 amino acids and contributing
most of the predicted interaction energy between ACE2 and
the SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-Cov proteins.
An ideal fragment would also include the downstream betahairpin carrying the conserved Lys353. However, this residue
is too far in the primary structure from the double helices. A
cut and seal between these two binding regions is unlikely
to work due to the unpredictable folding of the resulting
chimeric structure. Therefore, we propose to use the doublehelix fragment as a candidate for effectively inhibiting the
S-protein.
We also showed that this fragment remains stable in an aqueous environment (as opposed to a shorter fragment comprising only helix 1). Further, the fragment does not appear to interfere with the physiological ligand of ACE2 (angiotensinII), which is part of the renin-angiotensin system involved in the regulation of blood pressure.
We would expect this fragment to be relatively easy to express and purify at a large-scale level1 . Since this fragment
is derived from a protein that is normally expressed in human
tissues, the fragment should be relatively safe to use. The
fragment might be administered directly by aereosol, avoiding the systemic route and possible degradation of the peptide.
Additionally, the fragment might also be employed for diagnostic purposes. For example, immobilized on a substrate for
a Biacore test, the fragment could serve as a quick binding
assay to detect viral particles.
1 Since the inception of this work a manuscript by Zhang et al. (bioRxiv
2020.03.19.999318) has shown that a 23-mer from ACE2 can bind to SARSCov-2 S-protein.

Materials and Methods
Structural data for comparative analyses. For the struc-

tural analyses we used the following pdb structures:
• 6VW1: crystal structure of the S protein in complex
with ACE2 from SARS-CoV-2 (chain A and chain
E) (10)
• 6ACK: cryo-EM structure of the S protein in complex
with ACE2 from SARS-CoV (chain D and amino acids
23-512 of chain C, corresponding to CTD1 of S protein; extracted from complex between S-trimer and
ACE2) (9)
• 3KBH: crystal structure of the S protein in complex
with ACE2 from CoV-NL63 (chain A and E) (11)

Parrinello-Rahman barostat, and inspected the density values
over time (100 ps) to check the stability of the system.
After the equilibration steps, we ran a 100 ns production run
on a GPU-accelerated machine. All MD simulations were
performed with the same protocol and a time step of 2 fs. The
trajectories were visually inspected in UCSF Chimera (16),
and the RMSD with respect to the initial energy-minimized
conformer was obtained with the rms module in the GROMACS suite.
We computed the fraction of residues in α-helix with an inhouse Python program. Secondary structure assignment was
obtained with the DSSP program (19).

Docking experiments. Docking experiments and interaction energy calculations were carried out using
RosettaDock (12, 13). To obtain the per-residue energy
breakdown of the ACE2/S-protein complex we relaxed the
structure to relieve clashes using the flag_input_relax
protocol provided with the Rosetta suite. We then optimized the complex by performing 1,000 redocking experiments with the local docking protocol provided in the suite,
and selected the pose with the most favorable interaction energy. The per-residue energy breakdown was obtained with
the residue_energy_breakdown provided in the suite.
For the docking experiment with angiontensinII, we used the
ligand found in the crystal structure of the complex with the
ACE receptor (pdb:4APH, chain P) superposed onto the
crystal structure of ACE2. After relaxing the complex, we
carried out 1000 docking experiments and retained the pose
with the most favorable interaction energy.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations. Molecular dynamics

Simulations were performed using GROMACS (17, 18) with
the all-atom OPLS force field. Non-protein atoms were removed from the PDB files. The protein structures were
placed in a cubic box with 10Å from the box edge and solvated with spc216.gro, an equilibrated 3-point solvent
model.
Next, we added ions to the system with the genion module
and performed 50,000 steps of energy minimization. We then
carried out equilibration in two steps: NVT (canonical) ensemble followed by NPT (isothermic-isobaric). For the NVT
equilibration phase, we set the target temperature to 300 K
and inspected the temperature graph over time (100 ps) to
make sure the system was stabilized around the target temperature value. For the NPT equilibration phase, we used the
