We tested Norway rats inhabiting the sewer system of Antwerp, Belgium, for the presence of

23

SARS-CoV-2 following a local COVID-19 epidemic peak. In addition, we discuss the use and

24

interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests on non-human samples.

25

Methods

26

Between November and December 2020, Norway rat oral swabs, feces and tissues from the sewer

27

system of Antwerp were collected to be tested by RT-qPCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Serum

28

samples were screened for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a Luminex

29

microsphere immunoassay (MIA). Samples considered positive were then checked for neutralizing

30

antibodies using a conventional viral neutralization test (cVNT).

31

Results

32

The serum of 35 rats was tested by MIA showing 3 potentially positive sera that were later shown

33

to be negative by cVNT. All tissue samples of 39 rats analyzed tested negative for SARS-CoV-2

34

RNA.

35

Conclusion

36

This is the first study that evaluates SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban rats. We can conclude that the

37

sample of 39 rats had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2. We show that diagnostic serology

38

tests can give misleading results when applied on non-human samples. SARS-CoV-2 monitoring

39

activities should continue due to the emergence of new variants prone to infect Muridae rodents.

Introduction

41

Emerging infectious diseases have been in the spotlight of scientific research in recent years. Most

42

studies have focused mainly on the role of domestic and wild animals as zoonotic virus reservoirs

43

and the phenomena that drive animal-to-human transmission in order to explain outbreak

44

processes and spillover dynamics (e.g. Karesh et al 2010, Han et al 2016, Wardeh et al 2020).

45

However, the possibility of human-to-animal viral transmission raised concern during the SARS-

46

CoV-2 pandemic in 2020, when an asymptomatic dog from Hong Kong, whose owner was a COVID-

47

19 patient, tested positive for the virus (Sit et al 2020). Since then, similar human-to-animal

48

transmission events have been reported worldwide in domestic dogs (Sit et al 2020), cats (Chen at

49

al 2020; Garligliani et al 2020), farmed minks (ECDC 2020, Oreshkova et al 2020, Hammer et al

50

2021, Oude Munnink et al 2021), and numerous zoo animals (McAloose et al 2020; OIE 2021).

51

These events stimulated the scientific and public health community to better understand the

52

implications and origins of this phenomenon.

53

The probability of human-borne SARS-CoV-2 emerging in animal populations differs between

54

animal species through genetic and ecological differences (Gryseels et al., 2020). Susceptibility

55

firstly depends on the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells, which is determined by the affinity

56

between the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) in the spike (S) protein and its binding

57

receptor in host cells, Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) protein (Othman et al 2020; Qiu et

58

al 2020; Wu et al 2020). Whether the virus, after entering a host cell, can be transmitted

59

persistently depends on individual characteristics, infection dynamics and ecological

60

characteristics of the population. The longer the virus is shed from infected animals and / or the

61

higher the contact frequency between animals, the likelier it can initiate a successful transmission

62

chain. A good example of an optimal situation can be found in mink fur farms, which present a

63

highly susceptible species (American mink

Neovison vison

) housed indoors in extreme high

64

densities; leading to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks as reported worldwide (ECDC 2020; Hammer et al

65

2021; Oude Munnink et al 2021). In nature, some mammals may also live in such high-density

66

settings, particularly gregarious bats and fast-reproducing rodents. House mice (

67

Norway or brown rat (

68

most ubiquitous rodents in the world (Feng & Himsworth 2014). They are considered true

69

commensals, often living in close proximity to humans, increasing the risk of pathogen

70

transmission, as they are a source of a wide range of viral, bacterial and parasitic zoonoses

71

(Himsworth et al 2013). In Europe, Norway rats are well adapted to a synanthropic lifestyle and

72

thrive in urban environments, including city sewer systems, where they find food, water and

73

shelter (Mughini Gras et al 2012, Pascual et al 2020). Considering that many studies have detected

74

SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater from the sewage system globally (e.g. Medema et al 2020; Randazzo et

75

al 2020; Wu et al 2020), as well as in Antwerp, Belgium (Boogaerts et al 2021), these below-ground

76

rodent populations can be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

77

To date, only non-zoonotic

(RCov), China Rattus coronavirus HKU24 (ChRCoV HKU24) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV)

79

(Decaro & Lorusso 2020), though some human endemic coronaviruses (OC43 and NL63) may have

80

originated from a rodent reservoir (Corman et al 2018). SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to efficiently

81

infect and replicate in Cricetid rodent species like the golden Syrian hamster,

82

(Boudewijns et al 2020, Chan et al 2020, Sia et al 2020), the deer mouse (

host, thanks to a single substitution in the RBD, i.e. N501Y (Gu et al 2020). Remarkably, N501Y

89

substitution has arisen repeatedly in SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in humans, most notable the

90

variants of concern like B. 1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 (Yao et al 2021). This suggests that 1) SARS-CoV-2

91

can evolve relatively easily to infect a previous resistant species, and 2) several SARS-CoV-2

92

variants currently circulating have the inherent ability to infect

93

species of the Muridae family.

94

For these reasons, in the present study we tested Norway rats inhabiting the sewer system of

95

Antwerp, Belgium, for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in November and December 2020, following a

96

local COVID-19 epidemic peak by viruses mostly not carrying the N501Y substitution. In addition,

97

we discuss the use and interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 serological tests on non-human samples.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater

121

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples was done essentially as described in

122

Boogaerts et al. (2021). Wastewater was first centrifuged at 4625g for 30 minutes at 4 °C in an

123

Eppendorf 5910R Centrifuge (Aarschot, BE). The supernatant (40mL) was transferred to Macrosep

124

Advance Centrifugal devices with Omega Membrane (100 kDa; Pall, New York, US) for centrifugal

125

concentration according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the concentrate was standardize

126

to 1,5 ml with UltraPureTM DEPC-Treated Water (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNA extraction was

127

done with the automated Maxwell PureFood GMO and Authentication RNA extraction kit. In brief,

128

200 µL of the concentrate was added to 200 µL cetylrimethylammonium bromide buffer and 40 µL

129

proteinase K and the total volume was incubated for 10 minutes at 56 °C. This mixture was

130

transferred to the sample well together with 300 µL lysis buffer after which automated RNA

131

extraction was started in the Maxwell® RSC Instrument (Promega). The final elution volume was

132

50 µL. Amplifications with qPCR were performed in duplicate in 20 µL reaction mixtures using a 2x

To test SARS-CoV-2 exposure in sewer rats, serum samples were first screened for the presence of

142

binding anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, using an in-house Luminex microsphere immunoassay

143

(MIA) (Mariën et al 2021). The MIA is a high-throughput test that allows the simultaneous

144

detection of binding antibodies against different antigens of the same pathogen, increasing

145

significantly the specificity of the test. However, the prediction performance of this test depends

146

on the possibility to correctly estimating cut-off values of the negative controls. Since serum

147

samples from sewer rats captured before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were not available, we used as

148

negative controls serum from rats (

150

naïve laboratory mice (

run with two different beads coated with the virus’ nucleocapsid and spike antigens (Ayouba et al

154

2020). A biotin-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG Y-chain specific conjugate (Sigma, B7022, 1/300

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via

166

the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR protocol targeted to two regions of the nucleocapsid

170

simultaneously a beta-actin (ACTB) assay as internal control (Borremans et al 2015) in a duplex

Of the 8 water samples tested, 4 samples had detectable Ct values for Sars-CoV-2. Two samples

were positive below the LLOQ and two samples had Ct values that equaled with ± 7 gene copies

179

per ml of wastewater.

Serum samples of 35 sewer rats were analyzed by MIA. Three had MFI values higher than the cut-

off

182

remained lower than the MFI values of the positive control samples (Fig. 1). The three potentially

183

positive sera and four other sera with high MFI values were subsequently checked for neutralizing

184

antibodies by cVNT. All samples were seronegative for neutralizing antibodies; suggesting that the

185

captured sewer rats had not experienced SARS-CoV-2 in their life.

186

Regarding the tissue samples analyzed, oral swabs, feces, colon, lung, liver and kidney samples of

187

39 sewer rats tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR were all considered negative.

188

Discussion

189

To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Norway rats

190

exposed to an environment contaminated with the virus, the sewer wastewater. According to the

191

negative results obtained in both serology and PCR tests, we can conclude that the rodents

192

studied had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite continuous detection of viral RNA in the

193

Antwerp sewer water (Boogaerts et al 2021), including sewer water collected at the exact location

194

where the rats were captured.

195

Regarding the observed discrepancy between the results of the MIA and the VNT, we think it is

196

worth mentioning that the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 binding antibody tests (MIA or Elisa)

197

should be made with care when used on different types of samples than what the assays were

198

validated for. Indeed, although our MIA was clearly able to differentiate negative from positive

199

control cases in laboratory mice (Fig. 1), it falsely categorized three wild type rats as positive when

200

we estimated cut-off values based on serum from wild rats that were trapped outside of the

201

sewers. The misclassification is explained by the fact that sewer rats had overall higher MFI values

202

than rats trapped outside of the sewers (Fig. 1). This difference is likely caused by the higher

values

203

exposure rate to many other pathogens in the sewer systems (dirtier conditions and higher

204

population densities), which stimulates the adaptive immune system and results in overall higher

205

binding antibody levels. Therefore, to confirm exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in a particular wildlife

206

population based on serological data, VNTs are a better alternative (Tan et al 2020).

207

Studies to elucidate the animal species susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the ability

208

of the virus to spillover to several distantly related mammalian species (e.g. Chen at al 2020,

209

McAloose et al 2020, Sit et al 2020, Hammer et al 2021), with the potential to stimulate the

210

evolution of new variants with different antigenic properties (van Dorp et al 2020). This

211

phenomenon can lead to various consequences, such as putting species conservation actions at

212

risk if the virus affects endangered species, the establishment of novel reservoirs with the

213

potential to start new outbreaks in humans, and the evolution of novel variants that may evade

214

antibodies generated in humans, forcing the development of new antiviral therapies (Gryseels et

215

al 2020, Mercatelli & Giorgi 2020, Hammer et al 2021, Oude Munnink et al 2021).

216

The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in our sample of Norway rats could possibly be explained by the

217

dominance of SARS-CoV-2 lineages without the spike N501Y substitution in humans prior and at

218

the time of sampling the rats. Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many new

219

variants have been involved in humans and in non-human animal hosts (van Dorp et al 2020;

220

Hodcroft 2021; Leung et al 2021; Mercatelli & Giorgi 2020). Some of the currently most

221

widespread variants, like B.1.1.7/501Y.V1, B.1.351/501Y.V2 and P.1/501Y.V3 that emerged from

222

the UK, South Africa and Brazil, are potentially able to infect previous resistant species, such as

223

Muridae rodents, thanks to the N501Y substitution in the RBD (Gu et al 2020, Yao et al 2021). This

224

scenario, in conjunction with the synanthropic habits of several Muridae rodents and their ability

225

to develop high-density populations, creates the ideal conditions for the spread of new epidemics.

226

As such, despite the negative results found in Norway rats in the present study, we emphasize the

need to carry out regular monitoring activities for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Muridae rodents,

228

as well as other mammals exposed to humans, in order to detect human-to-animal transmission

229

events and prevent future outbreaks emerging from new animal reservoirs.
