One Sentence Summary: A subset of COVID-19 patients with neurologic impairment show
cerebrospinal fluid-specific immune alterations that point to both neuroinvasion and anti-neural
autoimmunity as potential causes of impairment.
Abstract: One third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet
SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential
role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined
immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients
with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological
responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated
innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells
in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting

a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases
examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from
serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and
found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing
neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients’ CSF
and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens—including one mAb specific
for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals
evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more
systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
The causative pathogen of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2,
primarily causes a respiratory illness. Yet, in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection associates
with severe and debilitating extrapulmonary symptoms, including neurological dysfunction(1).
Indeed, about a third of patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 develop neurologic
symptoms including anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, impaired consciousness, and seizure—only
some of which is explained by systemic complications including hypercoagulability(2). While
studies of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in affected patients only rarely detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA(36), the largest post-mortem neuropathological study to date found evidence for SARS-CoV-2
proteins in the brains of half of patients. However, there was little evidence of associated tissue
damage(7). Collectively, these observations suggest mechanisms other than viral replication may
contribute to neuropathology, and point to the need for a broad characterization of the
neuroimmune milieu during the course of neurologic impairment of COVID-19 patients. In this
exploratory study, we compared the innate and adaptive arms of the intrathecal and peripheral
immune responses in patients with COVID-19 complicated by diverse neurological symptoms.
Results
Overview of study
Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diverse neurological symptoms who underwent clinicallyindicated lumbar puncture were consented for collection of surplus CSF to be used for research.
Six participants with acute COVID-19, based on positive nasopharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2
RT-qPCR, were enrolled (Cases 1 – 6, Supplementary Table 1). Neurological symptoms
included encephalopathy (n=3), intractable headache (n=3), and seizure (n=1). All participants
donated paired blood and CSF, except for one patient who did not donate blood. Lumbar
punctures were performed on median hospital day 12.5 (range 2 - 43 days). Healthy controls
were previously enrolled through a neuroinfectious disease biorepository at Yale prior to the
COVID-19 pandemic, with CSF supernatant biobanked and frozen; these controls were included
based on age and sex match to the COVID-19 cases (n=3). Because fresh CSF is required for
single cell analyses, we also recruited additional uninfected control participants during the
COVID-19 pandemic (n=3): 2 were healthy community-dwelling adults, and one was
hospitalized for the work-up of frequent falls. These controls tested negative for SARS-CoV-2

by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. Fresh CSF and blood samples were processed into cells from
the CSF, CSF supernatant, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and plasma (Figure
1a). CSF (n=5) and plasma (n=6) samples from COVID-19 cases were negative for SARS-CoV2 RNA by RT-qPCR using the CDC primer-probe sets(8).
Transcriptional analysis reveals a coordinated innate immune cell response to COVID-19 in the
CNS
To investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host immune cell gene expression,
we performed single cell RNA sequencing with the 10X Genomics platform on 76,473 immune
cells from the CSF and blood of patients hospitalized with acute COVID-19 (n = 5) and
uninfected controls (n = 3 recruited in March – May 2020, and n = 8 healthy controls from Gate
et al(9)). To test for the presence of intracellular virus, open reading frames of SARS-CoV-2
(spike, ORF3a, envelope, membrane glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, nucleocapsid, and
ORF10) were added to the reference genome before alignment with CellRanger. No viral
transcripts were detected in any of the CSF cells or PBMCs. We performed unsupervised cluster
analysis and represented gene expression data from cases and controls in UMAP space. We
identified distinct T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell populations (Figure 1b), characterized by gene
expression patterns of canonical immune cell genes (fig. S1a). As expected, in both COVID-19
cases and controls B cells and neutrophils were enriched in the PBMC compartment compared to
the CSF, whereas CSF was enriched for a population of myeloid cells rarely present amongst
PBMCs (fig. S1b-c). To study CSF-specific gene expression patterns of immune cell populations
in COVID-19 patients, we compared gene expression in CSF from COVID-19 cases and
controls, and compared these differentially expressed genes to genes that were differentially
expressed in the PBMCs between COVID-19 cases and controls. In this way, we found COVID19 associated transcriptional changes that were unique to the CSF.
While CD16+ and CD14+ monocytes included the most differentially downregulated
genes in the PBMCs of COVID-19 patients, dendritic cells, and CSF-predominant myeloid cells
yielded the most differentially expressed genes in the CSF compartment (Figure 1c). While NK
cells in the CSF and the peripheral blood demonstrated comparable changes in the number of
differentially expressed genes in COVID-19 cases compared to controls, the genes affected were
mostly unique to each compartment (Figure 1c, fig. S1d).

Using single cell differential gene expression analysis, we found evidence for activation
of dendritic cells in the CSF of COVID-19 patients: 57% and 47% of the upregulated genes in
these cells were classified as type 1 and type 2 interferon stimulated genes, respectively (Figure
1d). NK cells in the CSF of COVID-19 patients also specifically upregulated genes associated
with NK cell activation (Figure 1e). Using CellphoneDB signaling network analysis(10, 11) we
found that in the CSF of COVID-19 patients, dendritic and NK cells are predicted to have
increased interaction with CD8+ and CD4+ T cells compared to what is predicted in the CSF of
healthy patients (Figure 1f). We asked whether the predicted interactions between activated
innate and adaptive immune cells in the CNS could be interpreted as driving the transcriptional
changes observed in the CSF T cells of COVID-19 patients. Using NicheNet(11), we designated
the CSF innate immune cells as “sender” cells and CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells as
“receiver” cells, and found enrichment in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of potential regulatory genes
affecting chemokine receptors, integrins, and activation of immune cells, consistent with results
from CellphoneDB analysis (fig. S2).
T cells in the CSF display increased cellular activation during COVID-19
Because T cells were predicted to be the main recipients of innate-adaptive cross talk, we
first subsetted and re-clustered CSF and blood T cells for further analysis (Figure 2a, fig. S3a-d).
While the relative proportions of CSF T cell populations were generally conserved in COVID-19
patients compared to controls, among the PBMCs there was a decrease in the frequency of naïve
CD4+ T cells (mean COVID-19 9.65%, healthy 18.219%; p =0.001) and an increase in effector
CD8+ T cells (mean COVID-19 30.9%, healthy 16.245%; p= 0.02) (Figure 2b). However, while
relative T cell populations were conserved in CSF of COVID-19 cases compared to control CSF,
we found significant COVID-19 associated transcriptional changes in CSF T cells (fig. S3d).
Effector CD4+ T cells in the CSF of COVID-19 patients showed significant transcriptional
changes compared to CD4+ T cells in the PBMCs of COVID-19 cases. After excluding any
genes that were also differentially expressed between T cells in the CSF and periphery of healthy
individuals, we identified genes that were upregulated in both Th1 and Th2 CD4+ T cells from
COVID-19 CSF (Figure 2d) and found enrichment for several gene pathways important for T
cell activation, as well as engagement of IL-1 and IL-12 mediated signaling pathways (Figure
2e). Effector CD8+ T cells in the CSF were similarly enriched for genes involved with canonical

immune response pathways when compared to CSF from healthy donors, including: 1) increased
motility and cell adhesion, 2) differentiation/proliferation, and 3) effector programming
(responses to IL-12, IL-1, IFN-g, and T cell co-stimulation), indicating the presence of a
coordinated T cell based immune response in the CNS (Figure 2f-g). Overall, COVID-19
associated transcriptional changes were observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the CSF,
were agnostic to the effector state of the cells, and predicted cell-cell interactions that were
unique to the CSF in COVID-19 cases, including T cell co-stimulation factors and trafficking
interactions (fig. S4a-b).
Unique cytokine profiles exist in CSF of COVID-19 patients compared to serum.
To validate the transcriptional enrichment in IL-12 and IL-1 signaling in the CSF of
COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms, we measured inflammatory cytokine levels in the
CSF and plasma using a Luminex cytokine panel (Figure 2g-h). Consistent with the single-cell
RNA sequencing results, IL-1b and IL-12 were elevated in the CSF of COVID-19 cases
compared to healthy controls, but were not elevated in the plasma of COVID-19 cases.
Conversely, CCL2, CXCL9, and IL-8 were significantly increased in the periphery of COVID19 cases compared to controls, but not in their CSF. Because IL-12 is thought to be produced by
activated antigen presenting cells to orchestrate Th1 responses through T and NK cell activation,
we examined the cellular source of IL-12 in COVID-19 cases. The innate immune cells with the
highest IL12A expression were CSF macrophages, NK, and dendritic cells (Fig s1e). Taken
together, these data support the single cell RNA sequencing analyses that identified IL-12 as
differentially expressed in CSF but not blood innate immune cells of COVID-19 cases, and
suggest a distinct effect of COVID-19 in the CNS on cytokines important for innate immunity
and for the induction of cell-mediated immunity, including IL-1 and IL-12.
CNS B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 differ from those in the periphery
Having examined compartmentalized innate immune cells, T cells, and cytokine
secretion, we next evaluated B cell populations in COVID-19 patients with neurologic
symptoms. In these patients, we found a significant enrichment of B cells in the CSF when
compared to CSF of controls (Figure 3a). Single cell RNA sequencing revealed several subtypes
of B cells amongst PBMCs and in the CSF (Figure 3b, sFig 5a-c), including distinct plasma cell

clusters. We therefore asked whether antibody-secreting B cells in the CSF exhibit a different
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profile than the those in the periphery. To do so, we utilized a
recently developed SARS-CoV-2 epitope Luminex panel(12) to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies in the CSF and plasma of COVID-19 cases and controls. As expected, anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies were not detected in any controls. In contrast, all COVID-19 cases had antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in both CSF and plasma. However, while all COVID-19 cases
developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid in both the plasma and CSF, antiRBD antibodies were rare in CSF but uniformly present in the plasma (Figure 3c). In addition,
we found that in all COVID-19 cases, both the relative prevalence (rank score: 12 being most
frequent, 1 being least frequent; Figure 3d) and levels of antibody (sFig 5d) diverged between the
CSF and plasma, revealing a different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profile between the CSF and
plasma of the same patient.
A mouse model of CNS SARS-CoV-2 infection demonstrates compartmentalized CNS antibody
secretion in response to CNS infection
Direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF is extremely rare in reported cases of
neurological complications of COVID-19(13), and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was similarly absent in
our cohort. However, we detected intrathecal anti-viral antibodies in all cases. To determine
whether the presence of CSF anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the absence of viral nucleic acid is
consistent with viral neuroinvasion as is the case for other encephalitis-causing viruses including
West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and measles virus(14-16), we used a recently
developed mouse model that reliably dissociates pulmonary and neurological infection of SARSCoV-2(17).
In our mouse model, adeno-associated virus is used to express the human ACE2 (hACE2)
receptor in the lung, brain, or the lung and brain and allows us to target SARS-CoV-2 infection
to specific tissues (sFig 6a-b). First, we used mice that express hACE2 in both the lung and the
brain and administered SARS-CoV-2 intranasally (Figure 4a). This allowed us to establish
SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the lung and the brain. In these mice, as expected, we detected
increased titers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in both the lung and brain tissue following inoculation.
However, despite robust brain infection, we do not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the CSF of

these mice (Figure 4b). This suggests that direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF at a
single time point may be insensitive to parenchymal or short lived SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion.
We next used the mouse model to evaluate whether the detection of intrathecal antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies in our COVID-19 patients was more likely triggered by a local antigen
(i.e., as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion) or reflected passive transfer of antibody
from the systemic circulation.(13) When SARS-CoV-2 was administered intranasally to mice
expressing hACE2 only in the lung, we detected significantly elevated anti-spike SARS-CoV-2
IgG in the lung and serum of mice, while we saw little antibody signal in the brain or CSF of
mice (Figure 4b, red). When SARS-CoV-2 was administered intranasally to mice expressing
hACE2 in both the brain and lung, we detected increased anti-spike antibodies in all four
compartments: lung, serum, brain, and CSF (Figure 4b, orange). Finally, when hACE2 was
expressed in brain only and SARS-CoV-2 was administered intracranially (causing infection in
the brain but not the lung), we detected increased anti-spike antibodies in the brain and CSF, but
not in the lung or serum of the mice (Figure 4b, green). These data support that systemic
infection alone may not be sufficient to account for the presence of humoral anti-viral immunity
in the CNS. Indeed, in these mice, anti-spike antibodies in the CSF and brain were only observed
in the setting of CNS infection, independent of whether there was an accompanying systemic
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patient CSF are self-reactive
Although our COVID-19 cases did not have detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their CSF, our
CSF serology data suggested that CSF-expanded B cell populations might be specific for SARSCoV-2 antigen(s). To address this question, we cloned individual monoclonal antibodies from
the COVID-19 case with the largest number of clonally expanded B cell receptor (BCR)
sequences in the CSF (n=5) and blood (n=4) (Case 1; Supplementary file 1). In this patient, the
most prevalent BCR sequences comprised ~25% and ~10% of the total B cells in the blood and
CSF, respectively (Figure 5a). Notably, the most prevalent BCR sequences detected in the CSF
of case 1 did not overlap with the most prevalent peripheral BCR sequences (Figure 5b),
supporting the hypothesis that a subset of CSF antibodies target antigen within the CNS. We
found that one of five CSF-derived and two of four PBMC-derived monoclonal antibodies
targeted SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 5c). None of the other monoclonal antibodies

recognized other SARS-CoV-2 antigens on the Luminex panel. Given reports of new-onset
humoral autoimmunity in COVID-19, we wondered whether some of the CSF-derived
monoclonal antibodies might be autoreactive to neural tissue. Therefore, we tested all
monoclonal antibodies for anti-neural immunoreactivity by anatomic mouse brain tissue staining.
Monoclonal antibodies were used as a primary antibody to immunostain mouse brain tissue and
labeled with an antihuman secondary antibody. An anti-influenza antibody targetting the
hemagglutinin antigen (anti-HA) was used as a negative control (anti-INF). Similar to anti-HA,
none of the PBMC-derived monoclonals recognized mouse brain tissue. In contrast, four of five
CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies exhibited some degree of anti-neural immunoreactivity—
including the anti-spike monoclonal (mAb C2) (Figures 5D and E). Notably, mAb C2 produced a
neuropil-predominant immunostaining pattern on mouse brain tissue suggesting that antigen may
be enriched in neuronal process or harbor an extracellular epitope. Immunoprecipitation mass
spectrometry of mouse brain lysate using mAb C2 significantly enriched synaptopodin, a
postsynaptic dendritic protein, and neural cadherin, a brain-enriched transmembrane protein that
mediates presynaptic to postsynaptic adhesion. These data indicate that some CSF-expanded B
cell populations in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms are reactive to SARS-CoV-2
antigen, self-antigen, or both.
Intrathecal humoral autoimmunity in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms
The emergence of inflammatory and humoral autoimmune disorders of the nervous
system during the para- or post-infectious period in COVID-19 is increasingly recognized and
includes: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), autoimmune encephalitis associated
with known autoantibodies, transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and one of its variants,
Miller Fisher syndrome(18-22). Given this literature, and the autoreactivity of CSF-derived
monocloncal antibodies from case 1, we hypothesized that our other COVID-19 cases might
harbor intrathecal autoantibodies. To test this, we screened our cohort of COVID-19 cases for
intrathecal anti-neural antibodies using a suite of complementary autoantigen detection
platforms: anatomic mouse brain tissue immunostaining, immunoprecipitation mass
spectrometry (IP-MS), and pan-human proteome phage display immunoprecipitation sequencing
(PhIP-Seq)(23-25). In these screens we included one additional patient with post-COVID-19
seizures and cognitive impairment who had been recruited after the completion of the

transcriptomic and cytokine analyses were completed (case 7, Supplementary Table 1,
Supplementary File 1). Like the other six acute COVID-19 cases, this subject had detectable
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in his CSF (Supplementary Figure s7).
Anatomic mouse brain immunostaining demonstrates the presence of intrathecal anti-neural
autoantibodies in most COVID-19 cases
More COVID-19 CSF (5 of 7) were immunoreactive to mouse brain tissue at a 1:10
dilution than control CSF (2 of 6) (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure s8). Control CSF staining
was not specific to any anatomic region, weakly pan-nuclear, or primarily subpial (Supplemental
Figure s9). None of the control CSF samples were immunoreactive beyond a 1:10 dilution,
indicating the absence of high titer or high affinity anti-neural autoantibodies. In contrast, at a
1:10 dilution, COVID-19 CSF produced immunoreactive staining of specific anatomic regions
including: cortical neurons (n = 4), the olfactory bulb (n = 3), thalamus (n = 3), CA3 field of the
hippocampus (n = 3), cerebellum (n = 3), the brainstem (n = 4), and cerebral vasculature (n = 2)
(Figure 5B & C, Supplemental Figure s8). Four and three COVID-19 CSF samples showed
continuing immunoreactivity at 1:25 and 1:50 dilutions, respectively. The data indicate that an
unexpectedly high proportion of CSF samples from COVID-19 patients with neurologic
impairment harbor high titers of anti-neural autoantibodies of unknown pathogenic significance.
IP-MS identifies intrathecal candidate autoantigens in a subset of COVID-19 cases
To screen for the neural protein targets of intrathecal autoantibodies, we
immunoprecipitated whole mouse brain lysate using CSF and plasma, trypsinized precipitated
proteins, and analyzed the resulting peptides by MS. IPs were performed in technical replicate,
by different individuals, using different mice as input. First we searched resulting spectra against
the SARS-CoV-2 proteome (Uniprot SARS-CoV-2 reference proteome, 06/2020). SARS-CoV-2
proteins were not detected. We then searched for human proteins. Consistent with circulating
protein expression patterns(26, 27) and circulating prothrombotic autoantibodies(28) in COVID19, complement, coagulation, and platelet degranulation pathway proteins of human origin were
significantly overrepresented in the IgG-bound protein fraction of plasma from our cases (fig.
S10).

To specifically identify candidate anti-neural autoantibodies in the CSF, we searched for
mouse proteins that were observed in both technical replicates and significantly enriched by
spectral counting and/or 1.5x enriched by MS1 peak area in COVID-19 CSF IPs relative to
controls. By IP-MS, between 5 and 56 (median = 20) proteins were enriched by the CSF, but
neither the plasma of the same case nor control CSF, indicating they were unique to the CSF
compartment of COVID-19 patients. By gene ontology pathway analysis, the top three cellular
components that IP-MS CSF-specific proteins mapped to were the myelin sheath (e.g. CNP and
NSF), post-synaptic density proteins (e.g. PSD-95 and SYN2), and the postsynaptic cytoskeleton
(e.g. INA and MYO5A) (Bonferroni-corrected p = 1.3 x 10-17, 3.3x10-8, and 1.6x10-6
respectively).
PhIP-Seq identifies intrathecal candidate autoantigens in a subset of COVID-19 cases
COVID-19 CSF was also screened for autoantibodies using a previously described PhIPSeq platform (T7 bacteriophage display) displaying ~730,000 overlapping 49 amino acid
peptides spanning all human proteins, including all known and predicted isoforms(24, 25). To
identify peptides that were significantly enriched by COVID-19 CSF compared to controls, we
first established an empirical enrichment threshold using a validated commercial antibody
targeting the protein GFAP (Supplemental File 2). For COVID-19 CSF samples, peptides with
suprathreshold enrichment in both technical replicates were considered candidate autoantigens.
COVID-19 CSF enriched between 2 and 40 CSF-specific proteins (median = 18, Supplementary
File 2). By gene ontology, synaptic proteins were also enriched in CSF-specific PhIP-Seq
candidate autoantigens (e.g., NRG3, SYNJ2, and DPYSL2) (Bonferroni-corrected p = 1.6x10-1).
COVID-19 CSF that was immunoreactive to mouse brain tissue at a 1:50 dilution was associated
with greater enrichment of candidate autoantigens by PhIP-Seq (19 – 40, median = 37) than CSF
that immunostained at a lower dilution or was not immunoreactive (1 – 16, median = 6)
suggesting a correlation between immunostaining status and the burden of CSF autoantibodies.
In some instances, the same candidate autoantigen was detected in COVID-19 cases by IP-MS
and PhIP-seq: UHRF1BP1 (Case 2), NUAK1 (Case 3), and DBN1 (Case 7).

To validate anti-neural autoantibodies identified in CSF, we selected two COVID-19
candidate autoantigens that were enriched by CSF but not plasma on PhIP-Seq: intraflagellar
transport protein 88 homolog (IFT88) and syntaphilin (SNPH). We validated them by HEK293
overexpression cell-based assay (CBA) (Figure 5D). HEK293 cells were transfected with a
plasmid encoding the candidate autoantigen, fixed, and immunostained with patient CSF. By
CBA, both anti-IFT88 and anti-SNPH validated as bona fide autoantibodies in the CSF of
COVID-19 Cases 1 and 3, respectively, but not control CSF (Figure 6E and Supplementary
Figure s11). Taken together, these autoantibody data indicate that: a high proportion of COVID19 CSF is immunoreactive to neural tissue, immunoreactive CSF enrich more CSF-specific
candidate autoantigens than non-immunoreactive CSF, and some candidate autoantigens
represent bona fide autoantibodies as verified by CBA.
Discussion
In this exploratory study, we performed a comprehensive set of immunologic
investigations to assess for CNS-specific immune responses in a series of COVID-19 patients
with neurologic symptoms(29, 30). While systemic multi-organ dysfunction is almost certainly a
driver of neurologic complications in a proportion of COVID-19 patients, here we identified both
innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses, as well as humoral autoimmunity that appears
to be unique to the CNS, and may therefore contribute to COVID-19 neuropathology.
CSF, while not identical to brain, is produced by the choroid plexus and bathes the CNS.
It is the only CNS tissue surrogate readily sampled in living humans. Analysis of CSF immune
cells has shed light on immune mechanisms of neuronal injury during other infections, including
HIV, neurosyphilis, and neuroborreliosis(31-33). By assessing CSF and blood in patients with
acute COVID-19 and neurological symptoms, we find evidence for a compartmentalized CNS
immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Through transcriptional and cytokine analyses, we find an
increase in CSF but not plasma IL-12 and IL-1b, factors that are central for coordinating innate
and adaptive immune responses to invading pathogens. Notably, mouse CoV neuroinvasion also
leads to IL-12 production by astrocytes and microglia(34).
Our data identified increased and divergent humoral responses within the CNS. This
humoral response included indirect evidence for neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 through the
presence of anti-viral antibodies in the CNS during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, using

an animal model, we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the CNS is necessary for stimulating
the production of intrathecal SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as isolated systemic viral infection is
associated with little to no antibody in CSF. These data therefore suggest that the presence of
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody in the CSF of COVID-19 patients may similarly reflect viral
infection of the CNS. Further supporting this contention, we generated a monoclonal antibody
from the CSF of a COVID-19 patient (case 1) with marked B cell clonal expansion in the CSF
that was specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This B cell clone was not detected in the
peripheral blood of the same patient. Notably, the other CSF-derived monoclonal antibodies
were variably immunoreactive to mouse brain tissue which motivated and expanded search for
autoantibodies in the CSF of our other COVID-19 cases.
Indeed, our extended studies of the CNS humoral response suggest that a subset of
COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms have an elevated burden of autoreactive
antibodies in their CSF. By anatomic immunostaining, an unexpectedly high proportion of our
COVID-19 cases harbored intrathecal autoantibodies, including anti-neural autoantibodies.
Hippocampal immunostaining from three cases was primarily restricted to the CA3 region
similar to a recent report of SARS-CoV-2 associated encephalitis(35). Other immunoreactive
anatomic regions included the olfactory bulb in three cases and cerebrovasculature in two—
anatomic regions with prima facie relevance to common neurologic sequelae of COVID-19 (i.e.,
anosmia and stroke). Subsequent unbiased protein and peptide screens of CSF identified a
diversity of candidate autoantibodies, and two of these autoantigens, SNPH and IFT88, were
subsequently validated by CBA. Although SNPH and IFT88 are previously undescribed
autoantigens of indeterminate clinical significance, their biologic functions suggest they could be
implicated in autoantibody-mediated neurologic dysfunction. SNPH is a brain-enriched
transmembrane protein that inhibits SNARE complex formation and subsequent neurotransmitter
release(36). IFT88 is a ciliary protein whose mutation causes a ciliopathy in humans and
anosmia in mice(37).
However, the mere presence of an intrathecal autoantibody does not mean that a patient
has an autoimmune encephalitis. Indeed, the patients in our exploratory cohort lacked evidence
for active inflammation on neuroimaging and/or did not have elevated conventional CSF markers
of neuroinflammation (i.e., white blood cell count, IgG index, and CSF-restricted oligoclonal
bands) typically, but not always, found in patients with autoimmune encephalitis. Moreover, our

study is complicated by the diverse range of neurological symptoms in our study participants.
Finally, a comparison group with a different systemic viral infection would help determine which
aspects of the findings are specific to COVID-19. Nonetheless, our data suggest that deeper CNS
phenotyping of COVID-19 patients with acute and/or chronic neurologic sequelae should be
pursued. Notably, COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms appear to have immune
responses to multiple autoantigens, implying that the increased compartmental humoral immune
response may reflect a broader immune activation syndrome. This is particularly true given that
humoral autoimmunity has been observed to target other organ systems in COVID-19, and may
also contribute to neuropathology during COVID-19(38-40),(41).
Taken together, our exploratory data suggest that even in COVID-19 patients with
neurologic symptoms who lack overt evidence for neuroinflammation on MRI or conventional
CSF testing, there is a compartmentalized immune response involving the innate and adaptive
arms of the immune system. Future research, involving careful clinical phenotyping and timely
investigations of the CSF, will help place these findings into a broader clinical context and
inform whether anti-viral and/or immunomodulatory therapies might be indicated for carefully
selected neurologically impaired patients with COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
All procedures were performed in a BSL-3/ABSL-3 facility (for SARS-CoV-2-related work)
with approval from the Yale Environmental Health and Safety committee (#20-19 and #18-16).
Study participants
COVID-19 patients admitted to Yale New Haven Hospital in March-May 2020 were recruited to
the IRB approved Yale IMPACT study (Implementing Medical and Public Health Action
Against Coronavirus CT). COVID-19 patients who were undergoing clinical lumbar puncture for
evaluation of neurological symptoms were included. Negative controls were recruited from the
surrounding community via IMPACT and the IRB approved HARC study at Yale. Healthy
control participants recruited after March 2020 were confirmed to be negative for SARS-CoV-2
infection by nasopharyngeal swab PCR. All participants or their designated surrogate consented
to donate 25cc of CSF for research studies. Blood was collected within one hour of lumbar
puncture. For autoantibody characterization assays, additional pre-pandemic healthy volunteers
(CTRLS 7 - 12, supplemental table S2) were recruited from the general population via word of
mouth, newspaper and internet advertisements, and poster flyers. Based on a questionnaire, they
were excluded if they had an Axis I psychiatric diagnosis, a first-degree relative with a known or
suspected Axis I psychiatric disorder, or any neurologic disorder. CSF samples were collected at
The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, NY.
SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, CSF, and plasma using the MagMax
Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation kit. A modified CDC RT-qPCR assay was used to detect
SARS-CoV-2 with the N1, N2, and human RNase P (RP) primer-probe sets and the NEB Luna
Universal Probe One-Step RT-qPCR kit on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR
Detection System(8).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized whole blood after
1:1 PBS dilution. The blood was layered over a Histopaque (Sigma-Aldrich, #10771-500ML)
gradient in a SepMate tube (Stemcell Technologies; #85460) and isolated according to
manufacturer’s instructions. The PBMCs were then aliquoted and stored at -80 for subsequent
analysis. CSF was centrifuged at 400G for 8 minutes, with cell-free supernatant removed for
cytokine and antibody assays, and cell pellet processed for single cell RNA sequencing, as
below.
Single cell RNA sequencing
Approximately 8,000 single cells from CSF and from PBMC from each participants were loaded
into each channel of a Chromium single-cell 5′ Chip (V3 technology). 5’ 10X libraries were
sequenced on Illumina Novaseq at approximately 50,000 reads per cell. Raw sequencing reads
were aligned to the human GRCh38 genome and gene counts were quantified as UMIs using
Cell Ranger count v3.0 (10x Genomics). We removed cells with >10% mitochondrial RNA
content, and included cells with > 500 and <2000 genes expressed per cell. Dimensionality
reduction, clustering, and visualization was performed using Seurat. Interferon regulated genes
were identified using Interferome(42). Differential expression analysis was performed in Seurat
v3(43) using the two-tailed Wilcoxon test, comparing cells from COVID-19 patients vs healthy
controls. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as: adjusted p < 0.05
and |log fold change| ≥ 0.1. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis was performed
using DAVID(44). DEGs in PBMC and CSF samples were compared using the UpSetR package.
To identify potential intercellular interactions between different cell types in the scRNAseq data, we utilized CellPhoneDB v2(10). Normalized count matrices and associated cell type
labels were provided to CellPhoneDB and analyzed under both the statistical mode and the
thresholding mode. Of note, since the statistical mode of CellPhoneDB seeks to assess the
specificity of a given interaction, a lack of statistical significance does not necessarily mean a
given interaction is not present. Therefore, when comparing the number of potential intercellular
interactions in COVID-19 patients vs healthy controls, the simpler threshold-based analysis
mode was used. In contrast, for pinpointing the top candidate cell-cell interactions in each
dataset, the statistical analysis mode was used, with a significance threshold of p < 0.05.

To further explore the downstream consequences of these intercellular interactions, we
performed NicheNet analysis(11). The cDC1, NK cell, monocyte, macrophage, and myeloid cell
clusters were defined as the potential “sender” cell populations. Different lymphocyte
populations were defined as potential “receiver” cells: all CD4 T cells merged across clusters,
merged CD8 T cells, or merged B cells. Potential ligands and receptors were defined as being
expressed in ≥ 20% of cells in a particular cell type. Differentially expressed genes (i.e.
candidate target genes) were defined similarly as above, with adjusted p < 0.05 and |log fold
change| ≥ 0.1.
T and B cell clustering
We initially combined all 76,473 CSF and blood cells and generated clusters using Seurat. For
each cluster we assigned a cell-type label using statistical enrichment for sets of marker genes,
and manual evaluation of gene expression for small sets of known marker genes. We then
created a separate Seurat object consisting only of T cells clusters from the original analysis, and
a separate Seurat object consisting only of plasma and B cells. We then re-clustered these T and
B cells and annotated sub-clusters using previously annotated marker genes.
BCR analysis
Single cell V(D)J sequences were generated using CellRanger vdj function. Assignments of
V(D)J sequences were performed using IgBLAST v.1.6.1 with the September 12, 2018 version
of the IMGT gene database (as described previously)(45, 46). Non-functional V(D)J sequences
were removed. Cells with multiple IGH V(D)J sequences were assigned to the most abundant
V(D)J sequence by unique molecular identifier count (and based on numbers of sequenced reads
in instances with ties). B cell clones in the CSF and circulation were identified using an approach
described previously using hierarchical clustering implemented using the DefineClones.py
function of Change-O v0.3.4 and a junctional sequence hamming dissimilarity threshold of
0.17(46). To account for the presence of light chains, heavy chain-based clones were corrected
for using an approach described previously(47).

Soluble chemokines and cytokines were assessed in CSF supernatant and paired plasma using
the HD71 Human Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array (Eve Technologies, Calgary, AB).
Statistical analysis was carried out using Qlucore Omics Software, version 3.6 (Lund, Sweden).
Cytokines that were absent from CSF or plasma under both COVID and controls conditions were
excluded from the respective analyses. Heatmaps were plotted using Z-scores, with the color
scale set to range from -2 to +2. Hierarchical clustering was applied to samples.
SARS-CoV-2 Serological Assay
Highly immunogenic linear regions of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were isolated by ReScan and
conjugated to Luminex beads as previously described(48). Briefly, high concentration T7 phage
stocks displaying immunodominant epitopes of the S, N and ORF3a proteins were propagated
and grown to high (>1011 PFU/mL) titer then were each conjugated to unique bead IDs according
to manufacturer’s Antibody Coupling Kit instructions (Luminex). Whole N protein (RayBiotech)
beads were conjugated similarly using manufacturer instructions with 5µg of protein per 1
million beads. For other whole protein Luminex-based beads, MagPlex-Avidin Microspheres
(Luminex) were coated with either the S protein RBD (residues 328-533) or the trimeric S
protein ectodomain (residues 1-1213).
All beads were blocked overnight before use and pooled on day of use. 2000-2500 beads per ID
were pooled per incubation with patient plasma at a final dilution of 1:500 or patient CSF at a
final dilution of 1:20 for 1 hour, washed, then stained with an anti-IgG pre-conjugated to
phycoerythrin (Thermo Scientific, #12-4998-82) for 30 minutes at 1:2000. Primary incubations
were done in PBST supplemented with 2% nonfat milk and secondary incubations were done in
PBST. Beads were processed in 96 well format and analyzed on a Luminex LX 200 cytometer.
Median Fluorescence Intensity from each set of beads within each bead ID were retrieved
directly from the LX200 and log transformed after normalizing to the mean signal across two
intra-assay negative controls (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and tubulin phage peptide
conjugated beads).
Mice for SARS-CoV-2 model
Six to twelve-week-old mixed sex C57Bl/6 (B6J) purchased from Jackson laboratories were
subsequently bred and housed at Yale University. All procedures used in this study (sex-

School of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.
AAV infection (Intratracheal and Intracisternal magna injection)
Adeno-associated virus 9 encoding hACE2 were purchased from Vector biolabs (AAV-CMVhACE2). Intratracheal injection. Animals were anaesthetized using a mixture of ketamine
(50 mg kg−1) and xylazine (5 mg kg−1), injected intraperitoneally. The rostral neck was shaved
and disinfected. A 5mm incision was made and the salivary glands were retracted, and trachea
was visualized. Using a 500μL insulin syringe a 50μL bolus injection of 1011GC of AAV-CMVhACE2 was injected into the trachea. The incision was closed with VetBond skin glue.
Following intramuscular administration of analgesic (Meloxicam and buprenorphine, 1 mg kg−1),
animals were placed in a heated cage until full recovery. Intracisternal magna injection. Mice
were anesthetized using ketamine and xylazine, and the dorsal neck was shaved and sterilized.
A 2 cm incision was made at the base of the skull, and the dorsal neck muscles were separated
using forceps. After visualization of the cisterna magna, a Hamilton syringe with a 15 degree
33 gauge needle was used to puncture the dura. 3μL of AAV9 (3.1012 viral particles/mouse) or
mRNA (4-5 μg) was administered per mouse at a rate of 1μL min-1. Upon completion of the
injection, needle was left in to prevent backflow for an additional 3 minutes. The skin was
stapled, disinfected and same post-operative procedures as intratracheal injections were
performed.
Generation of SARS-CoV-2 virus
To generate SARS-CoV-2 viral stocks, Huh7.5 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 isolate
USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources #NR-52281) to generate a P1 stock. To generate a working stock,
VeroE6 cells were infected at a MOI 0.01 for four days. Supernatant was clarified by centrifugation
(450g x 5min) and filtered through a 0.45 micron filter. To concentrate virus, one volume of cold
(4 °C) 4x PEG-it Virus Precipitation Solution (40% (w/v) PEG-8000 and 1.2M NaCl) was added
to three volumes of virus-containing supernatant. The solution was mixed by inverting the tubes
several times and then incubated at 4 °C overnight. The precipitated virus was harvested by
centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 60 minutes at 4 °C. The pelleted virus was then resuspended in PBS
then aliquoted for storage at -80°C. Virus titer was determined by plaque assay using Vero E6

cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection (intranasal): Mice were anesthetized using 30% v/v Isoflurane diluted
in propylene glycol. Using a pipette, 50μL of SARS-CoV-2 (3x107 PFU/ml) was delivered
intranasally. SARS-CoV-2 infection (intraventricular): Animals were anaesthetized using a
mixture of ketamine (50 mg kg−1) and xylazine (5 mg kg−1), injected intraperitoneally. After
sterilization of the scalp with alcohol and betadine, a midline scalp incision was made to expose
the coronal and sagittal sutures, and a burr holes were drilled 1 mm lateral to the sagittal suture
and 0.5 mm posterior to the bregma. A 10 μl Hamilton syringe loaded with virus, and was
inserted into the burr hole at a depth of 2 mm from the surface of the brain and left to equilibrate
for 1 min before infusion. Once the infusion was finished, the syringe was left in place for
another minute before removal of the syringe. Bone wax was used to fill the burr hole and skin
was stapled and cleaned. Following intramuscular administration of analgesic (Meloxicam and
buprenorphine, 1 mg kg−1), animals were placed in a heated cage until full recovery. For high
condition, 5μL of SARS-CoV-2 (3x107 PFU/ml) and for low condition 5μL of SARS-CoV-2
(3x106 PFU/ml) was used.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
ELISAs were performed as previously reported(49). In short, Triton X-100 and RNase A were
added to serum samples at final concentrations of 0.5% and 0.5mg/ml respectively and incubated
at room temperature (RT) for 3 hours before use to reduce risk from any potential virus in serum.
96-well MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific #442404) were coated with 50 μl/well of
recombinant SARS Cov-2 S1 protein (ACROBiosystems #S1N-C52H3-100ug) at a
concentration of 2 μg/ml in PBS and were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The coating buffer was
removed, and plates were incubated for 1h at RT with 200μl of blocking solution (PBS with
0.1% Tween-20, 3% milk powder). Serum was diluted 1:50 in dilution solution (PBS with 0.1%
Tween-20, 1% milk powder) and 100μl of diluted serum was added for two hours at RT. Plates
were washed three times with PBS-T (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) and 50μl of mouse IgGspecific secondary antibody (BioLegend #405306, 1:10,000) diluted in dilution solution added to
each well. After 1h of incubation at RT, plates were washed three times with PBS-T. Samples
were developed with 100μl of TMB Substrate Reagent Set (BD Biosciences #555214) and the
reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 2 N sulfuric acid.

Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed using commercially available software (Prism or Excel).
All values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Differences in means between two groups were
analysed using unpaired two-sided t-tests, unless otherwise noted. For scRNA-seq analyses, we
corrected for multiple comparisons and report adjusted P values using Benjamini–Hochberg
correction. For pathway analyses, Fisher’s exact test was used with Bonferroni correction for
multiple testing.
Anatomic Mouse Brain Tissue Staining
Postnatal day 40 – 60 mice (F1 generation of FVB x C57blk6 cross) were transcardially perfused
with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and brains post-fixed in PFA overnight. After sucrose
equilibration, brains were blocked in OCT and sectioned at 12µm on a standard cryostat.
Sections were permeablized and blocked in PBS containing 10% lamb serum and 0.1% triton x100. Sections were then incubated with CSF at 1:10, 1:25, and 1:50 overnight at 4C. Sections
were rinsed at least 5x with PBS and counterstained with anti-human IgG (Alexafluor 488).
Nuclei were stained with DAPI at 1:2000 and stained sections were coversliped with prolong
gold.

SNPH: The entry vector containing an attL-flanked gene insert encoding full-length
Syntaphilin/SNPH (pENTR223-SNPH, Human orfeome clone 10217) was gateway cloned into
an attR-destination vector encoding an N-terminal FLAG tag (Addgene, Plasmid #18700), with
the Gateway™ LR Clonase™ II Enzyme mix (ThermoFisher, 11791020). DH5a competent
cells were transformed with the gateway product mix, and plated onto Carbenicllin-100
LB plates.

HEK293 Cell-Based Assay Autoantigen Screening
HEK293 cells were plated onto 10mm poly-d-lysine coated (50µg/mL) coverslips in 24well plates. 293 cells were transfected overnight with pEF5-FRT-TagRFP-T-IFT88 and
pEZYflag-SNPH plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher). The following day, after
two rinses with ice cold 1X PBS, FLAG-SNPH transfected cells were fixed were 4% PFA for 10
minutes, and TagRFP-IFT88 transfected cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes.
The fixed cells were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 5% lamb serum in PBS, and permeabilized
for 30 minutes using with blocking buffer containing 0.5% Triton.
FLAG-SNPH overexpressing HEK293 cells were stained overnight with anti-FLAG
antibody at 1:1000 and CSF at 1:10 in 5% blocking buffer. TagRFP-IFT88 HEK293
overexpressing cells were stained overnight using mouse anti-RFP at 1:100, rabbit anti-IFT88 at
1:100, and undiluted CSF. The cells were rinsed with PBS four times, and stained with Alexa
Fluor secondaries at a 1:1000 dilution in 5% blocking buffer, FLAG-SNPH cells with anti-mouse
488 and anti-human 594, TagRFP-IFT88 cells with anti-human 488, anti-mouse 594, and antirabbit Cy5. Nuclei were stained with DAPI at 1:2000 in PBS for 5 minutes. Stained slides were
then mounted onto microscope slides with Prolong Gold antifade.

Imaging
Slides were imaged at 60X at the UCSF Nikon Imaging Center using a Nikon CSU-W1
spinning disk confocal microscope, equipped with an Andor Zyla sCMOS camera.
Immunoprecipitation-Mass Spectrometry
Sample preparation: For IP-MS, all sample handling through protein digestion was performed in
a BSL2 biosafety hood. Technical replicates were performed on the same day, by different
individuals, using different tissue preps. Plasma samples were unbuffered. CSF samples were
stored 1:1 in storage buffer. Samples were thawed on ice. Immunoprecipitations were performed
in unblocked, thin-walled 96-well Hard-Shell® PCR plates (Bio-Rad Cat. No. HSP9641). For
immunoprecipitations using patient plasma as the source of IgG, 2 μL of plasma was diluted in
200 μL of 1x PBS (Gibco Cat. No. 10010-023). For CSF immunoprecipitations, 75 – 200 μL of
CSF (depending on the amount of remaining biospecimen) was added to individual wells. For

IgG conjugation, magnetic protein A/G beads were washed once in 1x PBS and suspended in an
equal volume of PBS. To each well, 10 μL of washed protein A/G bead slurry was added and
plates were placed on a rocker at 4C for one hour followed by incubation on a shaker at room
temperature for one hour.
Postnatal day 40 – 60 mice (F1 generation of FVB x C57blk6 cross) were used as the
source of antigen. Mice anesthetized in isofluorane and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. For
each set, 3 brains (two males and one female for one replicate and two females and one male for
the other replicate) were rapidly dissected in ice cold PBS. For each replicate, 3 brains were
homogenized in ice cold tissue lysis buffer (7 mL) using a dounce homogenizer (approximately
20 strokes). Homogenized brain lysate was transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and
centrifuged at 4C for 10 minutes at 10,000 rcf. The supernatant from each set of brains was
pooled yielding two separately prepared stocks of brain lysate. After BCA protein concentration
determination, brain lysate stocks were diluted to 5 ug / uL in lysis buffer.
After IgG conjugation, the plate was placed on a magnetic plate, and the supernatant
aspirated and discarded into 10% bleach. To each well, 200 μL of brain lysate (5 μg / μL) was
added. Plates were sealed with adhesive aluminumized plate covers (Bio-Rad, Microseal® ‘F’
PCR Plate Seal, foil, pierceable Cat. No. #MSF1001). Antibody-bead-lysate complexes were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature under constant gentle agitation.
After 1 hour, IP plates were placed on magnetic plates and the lysate was aspirated and
discarded into 10% bleach. Beads and their respective immune complexes were washed with 180
μL of 2x with detergent wash buffer, then 1x in high salt wash buffer, then 1x in nondetergent
wash buffer, followed by 1x in ammonium bicarb buffer. For each well, washed beads were then
resuspended in 35 μL of ammonium bicarb buffer to which 1 μL sequencing grade porcine
trypsin was added (Promega, Cat. No. V5111). Immune complexes were digested on bead for 1
hr at 37°C. After digestion, plates were placed on magnetic plates and digestion reaction
containing trypsinized peptides was transferred to a protein LoBind Eppendorf tube (Eppendorf,
Cat. No. 022431081 and stored at -80°C until liquid chromatography (LC).
Spectrometry: LC separation was done on a Dionex nano Ultimate 3000 (Thermo Scientific)
with a Thermo Easy-Spray source . The digested peptides were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile
/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 1ug in 5µl of each sample was loaded onto a PepMap 100Å 3U 75

um x 20 mm reverse phase trap where they were desalted online before being separated on a 100
Å 2U 50 micron x 150 mm PepMap EasySpray reverse phase column. Peptides were eluted
using a 60 minute gradient of 0.1% formic acid (A) and 80% acetonitrile (B) with a flow rate of
200nL/min. The separation gradient was ran with 2% to 5% B over 1 minutes, 5% to 10% B over
7 minutes, 10% to 55% B over for 43 minutes, 55%B to 99%B over 1 minutes, a 4 minute hold
at 99%B, and finally 99% B to 2%B held at 2% B for 10 minutes. Mass spectra were collected
on a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a data-dependent top speed
mode with one MS precursor scan followed by MS/MS spectra for 3 seconds. A dynamic
exclusion of 60 seconds was used. MS spectra were acquired with an isolation window of 1.2
Da, a resolution of 60,000 and a target of 4 × 105 ions or a maximum injection time of 50ms.
MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 15K and a target of 1 × 104 ions or a
maximum injection time of 35ms with maximum parallelizable time turned on. Peptide
fragmentation was performed using collisionally induced dissociation (CID) with a normalized
collision energy (NCE) value of 30. Unassigned charge states as well as +1 and ions >+5 were
excluded from MS/MS fragmentation.
Data Analysis (Scaffold Proteome Software): Tandem mass spectra were extracted by Proteome
Explorer 1.4 (Thermo Scientific). Charge state deconvolution and deisotoping were not
performed. All MS/MS samples were analyzed using X! Tandem (The GPM, thegpm.org;
version X! Tandem Alanine (2017.2.1.4)). X! Tandem was set up to search the Uniprot Mouse
reference proteome (1/2020, 258832 entries) and Uniprot SARS-CoV-2 Database (version
06/2020, 262 entries) assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. X! Tandem was searched with a
fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.40 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 20 PPM. Glu->pyro-Glu of
the n-terminus, ammonia-loss of the n-terminus, gln->pyro-Glu of the n-terminus, deamidated of
asparagine and glutamine, oxidation of methionine and tryptophan and dioxidation of methionine
and tryptophan were specified in X! Tandem as variable modifications. Scaffold (version
Scaffold_4.9.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR) was used to validate MS/MS based
peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be
established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Peptide
identifications were also required to exceed specific database search engine thresholds. X!
Tandem identifications required at least . Protein identifications were accepted if they could be

established at greater than 5.0% probability to achieve an FDR less than 5.0% and contained at
least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm
(Nesvizhskii, Al et al Anal. Chem. 2003;75(17):4646-58). Proteins that contained similar
peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy
the principles of parsimony. Proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into
clusters. For identification of significant peptides, Scaffold settings were as such: protein
threshold = FDR < 5%, minimum peptides = 1, peptide threshold = MRS_otIt. Mouse proteins
that were significantly enriched after Benjamini-Hochberg corrected t-test (alpha = 0.05) and that
were observed in both replicates were considered candidate autoantigens.
Data Analysis (MS1 Peak Area – Quandenser): The Quandenser pipeline
(https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/quandenser-pipeline ) was used with its default
settings on the raw mass spectrometry files . The Quandenser pipeline consists of Quandenser,
Crux and Triqler (cite = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17037-3 )
Data Analysis (Gene ontology): ToppGene.org was used for gene ontology analyses of IP-MS
and PhIP-Seq Data.
Phage Display Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq)
Preparation of phage libraries from stocks: A 500mL culture of E. Coli BLT5403 was incubated
at 370C with shaking until log phase, defined as OD600= 0.5. The culture was then inoculated
with the stock phage library with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and incubated at
370C for 3 hours in order for complete lysis to occur. Lysate was spun at 3500rpm for 15 minutes
to remove debris.
Phage were precipitated by adding 20% culture volume of 5x PEG/NaCl (PEG-8000
20%, NaCl 2.5mM) and left overnight at 40C. Phage were then spun down at 40C for 15 minutes
at 10,000g, re-suspended in storage media (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 6mM
MgCl2) and filtered through a 0.22uM filter. Resulting phage libraries were then tittered by
plaque assay, with an acceptable working concentration between 109-1011 pfu/mL.

96-well 250uL BioRad hardshell plates were blocked overnight with blocking buffer (3%
BSA, 0.1% PBS-T) to prevent nonspecific binding of phage and/or antibodies to walls of the
plate. Patient samples were stored in blocked 96-well plates and diluted in 2x storage buffer
(40% glycerol, 40mM HEPES pH7.3, 0.04% NaN3 in DPBS). Blocking buffer was then replaced
with 150uL of pre-prepared phage library and incubated with 2uL patient sample overnight with
shaking at 40C. Commercial antibodies were diluted at 1:50.
Protein A and G magnetic beads (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) were washed by magnetic
separation and re-suspended in an equivalent volume of 0.1% TNP-40 (150mM NaCl, 50mM
Tris-HCL, 0.1% NP-40). 10uL of A/G beads were added to each IP reaction and incubated at
40C with shaking for 1 hour to allow patient antibodies to bind to beads. Beads were then washed
by magnetic separation with 150uL 0.1% TNP-40 three times. Subsequent to final wash, beads
were re-suspended in 150uL of Luria broth (LB) and used to inoculate 500uL of fresh E. Coli
cultures (OD600= 0.5) in 96-deep well plates for in vivo amplification. Cultures were incubated
for 2 hours at 370C with shaking and allowed to complete lysis. 96-deep well plates were then
spun down at 3300prm for 10 minutes. 150uL of lysate (IP1) was saved and stored at -200C.
Another 150uL of lysate was mixed with an additional 2uL of patient sample overnight 40C and
immunoprecipitation was repeated (IP2) to further enrich for relevant antibody-binding phage.
NGS library preparation of phage DNA
Plates containing lysate from IP2 were thawed and subsequently diluted 1:50 in ddH2O.
Enrichment of phage DNA and barcoding of individual IP reactions was performed using a

After PCR reaction was completed, products were immediately pooled (3uL per sample)
and size selected with a 0.67x bead clean-up (SPRISelect, Beckman Coulter). Product
concentration was quantified using an automated electrophoresis system (Bioanalyzer, HighSensitivity DNA Chips, Agilent). Libraries were sequenced on the iSeq (cases 1 - 6 and controls)
or NovaSeq 6000 (case 7 and controls) (Illumina) using 150nt paired-end reads.
PhIP-Seq Bioinformatic Analysis: Raw reads generated from the PhIP-Seq peptidome assay
were aligned to the reference database using RAPSearch (v2.2). Peptide counts outputted from
this workflow were normalized to reads per 100 thousand (RPK) for every sample by diving
each peptide count by the sum and multiplying by 100,000. The resulting peptide RPK count
matrices were analyzed using a custom bioinformatics pipeline written in R.
For the analysis, these data were divided into disease and reference groups for both
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples. The disease group contained SARS-CoV-2 and
A-G bead samples. The reference group contained healthy control (HC) and A-G bead samples.
Peptide Fold Change (FC) was calculated for each sample. Peptide counts for Sars-CoV2
samples were divided by the mean RPK of the reference group and healthy control samples were
divided by the mean RPK of the disease group. In addition, the FC for GFAP samples were
calculated in the same way using the mean of all A-G bead samples.
To identify enriched peptides, results from each sample were filtered using a set of
thresholds that, when using a commercial antibody to GFAP, consistently identified GFAP
peptides while minimizing nonspecific off-target peptide identification (Agilent Z033429-2,
1:200 dilution). Each peptide was required to have a minimum of 1 RPK as well as a FC > 10. In
addition, thresholds were applied at the gene level. Genes were kept if at least one peptide had a
FC > 100 and a total (summed) RPK > 20 across all peptides in the gene. A Kmer analysis was
applied to amino acid sequences of all peptides that passed the previous filters. Using a sliding

window algorithm, with a window size of 7 and a step size of 1, all 7-mers were compared across
SARS-CoV-2 and HC samples. Proteins for which peptides containing at least one 7-mer overlap
with another peptide whose total rpK was ≥ 20 were carried forward in the analysis.
Additionally, proteins with nonoverlapping peptides with an individual rpK ≥ 20 an FC ≥ 100
were also carried forward. Proteins that passed these thresholds in both technical replicates but
were not enriched by reference samples were considered candidate autoantibodies. This
workflow was repeated on a per sample level, and the results for each sample were stored
separately.
Human Monoclonal antibodies
Expression Vector Cloning:
Select heavy and light chain variable region fragments, or framework 1 through 4 as defined by
the IMGT human V gene database, were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.
Heavy, kappa, and lambda fragments were cloned into AbVec2.0-IGHG1 (Addgene plasmid #
80795 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:80795 ; RRID:Addgene_80795), AbVec1.1-IGKC (Addgene
plasmid # 80796 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:80796 ; RRID:Addgene_80796), and AbVec1.1IGLC2-XhoI (Addgene plasmid # 99575 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:99575 ;
RRID:Addgene_99575) linearized expression vectors, respectively. All expression vectors were
a gift from Hedda Wardeman(50). Cloning was performed in a total of 20ul with 60ng of
linearized vectors, 18ng heavy or light chain fragment and 10ul of Gibson assembly master mix
(New England Biolabs). 5-alpha competent E. coli (New England Biolabs) were transfected at
42C with 2ul unpurified, assembled plasmid. Colonies were sequence to confirm correct
assembly, and then plasmids were purified from 3mL of E. coli in LB Broth with 100ug/mL
ampicillin using Qiaprep Spin columns (Qiagen).
Monoclonal Antibody Production:
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced by Celltheon Co. by transfecting Chinese hamster
ovarian cells with equal amounts of heavy chain and light chain plasmids. Culture supernatant
was harvested and mAbs were subjected to affinity purification.

plasma proteins from COVID-19 patients. Top network: COVID-19 plasma
immunoprecipitations were compared as a group to control plasma immunoprecipitations.
Human proteins that were elevated 1.5-fold or greater by MS1 peak areawere analyzed by stringdb.org. String-db network connection data were imported into cytoscape along with IP-MS qvalues (a q-vlaue is an FDR-adjusted p-value). The protein nodes are shaded (green) according to
their log2 fold enrichment. Red borders indicate those proteins with a q-value < 0.05, and blue
borders indicate q-values > 0.05. Bottom table: ToppGene gene ontology pathway anaylsis of the
