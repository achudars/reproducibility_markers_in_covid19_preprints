Abstract

2

Without approved vaccines and specific treatment, severe acute respiratory syndrome

3

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading around the world with above 20 million

4

COVID-19 cases and approximately 700 thousand deaths until now. An efficacious and

5

affordable vaccine is urgently needed. The Val308 – Gly548 of Spike protein of SARS-

6

CoV-2 linked with Gln830 – Glu843 of Tetanus toxoid (TT peptide) (designated as S1-4)

7

and without TT peptide (designated as S1-5), and prokaryotic expression,

8

chromatography purification and the rational renaturation of the protein were performed.

9

The antigenicity and immunogenicity of S1-4 protein was evaluated by Western Blotting

10

(WB) in vitro and immune responses in mice, respectively. The protective efficiency of it

11

was measured by virus neutralization test in Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2. S1-4

12

protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression and

13

chromatography purification. Adjuvanted with Alum, S1-4 protein stimulated a strong

14

antibody response in immunized mice and caused a major Th2-type cellular immunity

15

compared with S1-5 protein. Furthermore, the immunized sera could protect the Vero E6

16

cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256. The candidate

17

subunit vaccine molecule could stimulate strong humoral and Th1 and Th2-type cellular

18

immune response in mice, giving us solid evidence that S1-4 protein could be a

19

promising subunit vaccine candidate.

Introduction

2

A highly virulent and pathogenic Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) viral infection

3

with incubation period ranging from two to fourteen days, transmitted by breathing of

4

infected droplets or contact with infected droplets, was spreading all over the world1.

5

Until 12 August 2020, 20,162,474 COVID-19 cases were reported with 737,417 deaths

6

globally2.

7

COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

8

CoV-2)3. Coronaviruses named after their morphology as spherical virions with a core

9

shell and surface projections resembling a solar corona, are enveloped, positive single-

10

stranded large RNA viruses that infect humans, but also a wide range of animals4. SARS-

11

CoV-2 closely related to the SARS-CoV virus5 belongs to the B lineage of the beta-

12

coronaviruses6. There are more than 100 candidate vaccines in development worldwide,

13

while among the vaccine technologies under evaluation are whole virus vaccines,

14

recombinant protein subunit vaccines, and nucleic acid vaccines7. Based on previous

15

experiences with SARS-CoV vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should refrain from

16

immunopotentiation that could lead to increased infectivity or eosinophilic infiltration7.

17

Therefore, subunit vaccine might be one of the better candidate vaccine for SARS-CoV-2

18

for its simpler in composition and less uncontrollable risk factors8. There are four major

19

structural proteins including the nucleocapsid protein (N), the spike protein (S), a small

20

membrane protein (SM) and the membrane glycoprotein (M) with an additional

21

membrane glycoprotein (HE) in the HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 beta-coronaviruses9. Like

22

other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 infects lung alveolar epithelial cells by receptor-

23

mediated endocytosis with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme II (ACE2) as the cell

receptor5. SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S

2

protein10, 11. Full-length S (S1 and S2) or S1 which contains RBD could induce

3

neutralization antibodies that prevent viral entry12. RBD structurally and functionally

4

distinct from the remainder of the S1 domain are highly stable and held together by four

5

disulfide bonds8. Numerous researchers have demonstrated that RBD contains abundant

6

T cell and B cell epitopes including neutralization epitope and has the potential quality as

7

a subunit vaccine8, 13-15. Subunit vaccines possessed high safety profile, consistent

8

production and could induce cellular and humoral immune responses, but need

9

appropriate adjuvants12.

10

Tetanus toxoid (TT) as a protein carrier could enhance effectively humoral and

11

cellular immune responses of antigenic epitopes16. TT exerts the requisite immunological

12

enhancement and promotes production of high levels of antibodies through traditional

13

and effective T-B cell reaction16. TT has been proposed because of its safe and also has

14

been commercially applied in human vaccine17. Since virtually all people have

15

endogenous antibodies against TT, such commonly occurring antibodies are promising

16

candidates to utilize for immune modulation18 through antibody complexed antigen.

17

Gln830 – Glu843 of TT (TT peptide) as a promiscuous T-helper epitope has a strong

18

binding capacity to DR3 allele19, 20 and is frequently used as T cell stimulator to enhance

19

the immunogenicity of exogenous epitopes19, 21, 22.

20

Without specific prevention measures, current effective managements mainly focus

21

on the enforcement of quarantine, isolation and physical distancing23. An efficacious and

22

affordable vaccine is urgently needed. In this study, we prepared a novel molecule of

RBD linked TT peptide (designated as S1-4) and evaluated its antigenicity,

immunogenicity and protective efficiency as potential subunit vaccine.

Results

4

S1-4 protein was prepared to high homogeneity and purity by prokaryotic expression

5

and chromatography purification:

6

Upon induction, in small-expression, the expected S1-4 protein of 29.0 kDa was

7

observed (Figure 1A) suggesting that S1-4 protein could be appropriately expressed in

8

E.coli. Through large-scale expression (4 L LB medium), S1-4 protein accounted for

9

approximately 26.38% in the total cell lysates, and increased up to 70.13% in the total

10

proteins from the inclusion bodies (IBs) (Figure 1B). Therefore, S1-4 protein expressed

11

and existed mainly in the IBs form in E.coli. S1-4 protein was treated with 8mol/l urea

12

(pH8.0) and purified by IEX, S1-4 protein existed mainly in the unbound fraction (Figure

13

1C). The purity of S1-4 protein can reach 96.9% at 2.64 mg/mL through HIC (Figure 1D).

14

Renaturated by stepwise dialysis, the concentration and purity of S1-4 protein were 0.84

15

mg/mL and 98.71%, respectively (Figure 1D).

Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (Figure 3A). The total antibody GMT in mice

2

immunized with S1-4 protein/Alum came to 100 one week after the first injection, while

3

it climbed to 1481 one week after the second injection. However, the total antibody GMT

4

in mice immunized with S1-5 protein/Alum was only 24 after the first injection and 192

5

after the second injection. Finally, one week after the third injection, the total antibody

6

GMT in mice immunized with S1-4 protein/Alum was 1728, while that of S1-5

7

protein/Alum was 456. Obviously, S1-4 conjugated with TT peptide tail were more

8

immunogenic than S1-5 without TT peptide.

9

Enzyme-linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay was applied to enumerate Spot-forming

10

cells (SFCs) for IL-4 and IFN-γ in splenocytes of immunized mice (Figure 3B). More IL-

11

4 SFCs existed in splencytes of mice immunized with S1-4 protein/Alum comparing with

12

mice immunized with S1-5 protein/Alum (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, there were more IFN-γ

13

SFCs in splencytes of mice immunized with S1-4 protein/Alum than that of S1-5

14

protein/Alum (P < 0.05). These results indicated that not only Th1 (IFN-γ) but also Th2

15

(IL-4) SFCs were involved in the immune response against S1-4 protein/Alum and S1-5

16

protein/Alum. Remarkably, both IL-4 and IFN-γ SFCs were more in mice immunized

17

with S1-4 protein/Alum than those in mice immunized with S1-5 protein/Alum.

the neutralization antibody GMTs of sera of mice immunized with S1-5 protein/Alum

2

were only 48 and 64 on Day28 and Day35, respectively. Furthermore, neutralization

3

antibody GMT increased along with total antibody GMT, whether in S1-4 or S1-5 protein

4

immunized mice (P < 0.05). Those results indicated that TT peptide could not only

5

enhance the total antibody response, but also the neutralization antibody.

Discussion

7

The independence of structure and function made RBD the ideal choice of subunit

8

vaccine. Several expression systems such as CHO-, baculovirus-, and yeast had been

9

used to express recombinant RBD protein11, 24-26. Considering its efficiency, time and cost

10

saving and the safety consideration, nothing else could match the E. coli expression

11

system, especially in the circumstance that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently needed. Xia

12

had developed successfully the Hepatitis E virus (HEV) vaccine27 and Human

13

Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine28 by prokaryotic expression system. Furthermore, both of

14

the vaccine had been licenced by National Medical Products Administration of China. By

15

the approach of prokaryotic expression system, the annual productivity could reach

16

billions of vaccine dosages after the candidate vaccine was approved, which would make

17

it possible to prevent and eliminate COVID-19 on a global scale. However, two key

18

questions, glycosylation and renaturation, bear the brunt, if prokaryotic expression

19

system is applied. First of all, there are only two predictive N-linked (Asn331 and

20

Asn343) and O-linked (Thr323 and Thr385) glycosylation sites within Val308 –

21

Gly54829. It was presumed that glycosylations at those sites of RBD were not crucial for

22

maintance of antigenicity and immunogenicity of it8. In this study, S1-4 protein without

23

glycosylation displayed ideal antigenicity (Figure 2) and immunogenicity (Figure 3).

10

1

Moreover, glycosylation and mature structure might hinder the recognition of related

2

epitopes by immune cells. We found that anti-S1-4 protein antibody titers (unpublished)

3

were much higher than anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers. Secondly, the existence of four

4

pairs of cysteine brings great difficulties to the reconstruction of natural structure8.

5

Fortunately, our previous experience of SARS-CoV RBD renaturation facilitated the

6

current work30.

7

Humoral immune response, especially the neutralization antibody response, plays an

8

important role by limiting infection at later phase and prevents reinfection in the future12.

9

S1-4 protein can induce high titer neutralizing antibody. One week after the third

10

immunization, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody GMT detected by ELISA reached 1728 while

11

neutralization antibody GMT came to 256 measured by micro-neutralization assay

12

(Figure 3A). In contrast, S1-5 protein without TT peptide was barely satisfactory.

13

SARS-CoV-2 maybe induce delayed type I IFN and miss the best time for viral

14

control in an early phase of infection12. In general, Th1-type immune response is crucial

15

in an adaptive immunity to eliminate viral infection12. The Th1 cells produce cytokines

16

that promote cell-mediated immune responses such as IFN-γ whilst the Th2 cells induce

17

cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, which will activate humoral immune responses31.

18

Current evidences strongly indicated that Th1 type response is a key for successful

19

control of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and probably is true for SARS-CoV-2 as well12.

20

According to the ELISpot assay, S1-4 protein/Alum could stimulate Th1 and Th2 – type

21

immune responses simultaneously in mice (Figure 3B). Furthermore, TT peptide played

22

an important role in promoting cytokine secretion including Th1 and Th2-type cytokines

23

(Figure 3B).

1

Protective efficacy is crucial for a vaccine. Neutralization activity of immune serum

2

is often the key to judge whether a candidate vaccine will be successful or not. The serum

3

from mice immunized with S1-4 protein/Alum could protect Vero E6 cells from SARS-

4

CoV-2 infection with neutralization antibody GMT 256 on Day35 (Figure 3A).

5

In conclusion, our preparation of trunked RBD protein fused TT peptide could

6

stimulate humoral and Th1 and Th2- type cell-mediated immune response in mice and

7

the immunized sera could protect Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This would

8

make this subunit protein ideal vaccine candidate.

Experimental Protocol

10
11

Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine
The SARS-CoV subunit antigen, designated as S1-4, consisted of the truncated Spike

12

protein Val308 – Gly548 (GenBank No. YP009724390) and TT peptide Gln830 –

13

Glu843 with GGG as the linker (Figure 4). The gene encoding S1-4 protein was codon-

14

optimized and sub-cloned into pET28a (+) vector using restriction endonucleases (NcoI

15

and XhoI). The positive plasmids were confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis

16

and sequencing, while the single colony of freshly transformed BL21(DE3) was chosen

17

depending on the SDS-PAGE analysis of small-scale expression.

1

Small-scale expression cultures inoculated with BL21(DE3) carrying S1-4 plasmids

2

were induced by IPTG (1 mmol/L) at 37°C for 2 h. A large-scale preparation was

3

performed in 4-L LB medium induced by IPTG (1 mmol/L) at 32°C for 4 h. The cell

4

harvested by centrifugation (4,000 g, 10 min, 4°C) were resuspended with Buffer I (10

5

mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH8.0) before sonic disruption

6

(300 W, 20 s, 20 s, and 30 times). The pellets retained by centrifugation (17,300 g, 20

7

min, 4°C) were washed twice with Buffer I. After the pellets were dissolved with Buffer

8

II (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 8 mol/L urea, pH8.0), S1-4 protein in the denatured solution was

9

purified by DEAE ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) then followed with Octyl

10

Sepharose 4 Fast Flow hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC). After being

11

appropriately diluted, S1-4 protein was renatured by gradually reducing the urea content

12

with 20 mmol/L PB (pH8.0) at 4°C for 4 h each cycle. After refolding, S1-4 protein

13

solution was centrifuged to remove the precipitate and sterile filtered by 0.2 μm filter.

14

Protein analysis was conducted by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)

15

and Western Blotting (WB) using convalescent serum of COVID-19 patients, Rabbit

16

monoclonal antibody against RBD and related HRP –conjugated secondary antibodies.

17

After diluted with normal saline, S1-4 protein was mixed with aluminum adjuvant in a

18

certain proportion for adsorption, and the antigen concentration in the final adsorption

19

product was adjusted to 800 μg/mL. The mixture is designated as SARS-CoV-2 subunit

20

vaccine.

21

The prokaryotic expression and chromatography purification of S1-5 protein were

22

performed according to those of S1-4 protein. The MW of S1-5 was approximately 27.4

23

kDa. Similarly, S1-5 was adjuvanted with Aluminum as a control.

Preliminary analysis of immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine
All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Welfare

3

Committee at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese

4

Center for Disease Control and Prevention (No. 20200201003). The neutralization tests

5

were performed in a BSL-3 laboratory. Ten specific pathogen-free, female 4~6 weeks old

6

BALB/c mice (Vital River Laboratories, Beijing, China) each group were immunized

7

i.m. with 50 μL of S1-4/Aluminum, S1-5/ Aluminum or Aluminum alone respectively,

8

with two booster shots at Day 7 and 14. Orbital venous blood was sampled at regular

9

intervals (Day 0, 14, 28 and 35) and sera was collected by centrifugation (1,000 g, 10 min,

10

4°C) after coagulation at room temperature for 2 h.

11

ELISA was applied to evaluate the antibody response according to the previous

12

study32. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers were determined by an endpoint dilution

13

ELISA on micro-well plates coated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral culture (30

14

ng/well). Briefly, sera serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added into

15

micro-well plates (100 μL/well) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Goat anti-mouse IgG

16

antibody (HRP conjugate) (Sigma-Aldrich, SL, USA) was used as the detection antibody

17

(100 μL/well). Color reaction was developed with 3, 3’, 5, 5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)

18

and terminated with H2SO4 solution. The absorbance was read at 450 nm with an ELISA

19

reader (Thermo Fisher, Mannheim, Finland). Antibody titers were determined as the

20

highest dilution at which the mean absorbance of the sample was 2.1-fold greater than

21

that of the control serum.

Evaluation of protective efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine
The neutralization antibody titers were detected by a traditional virus neutralization

3

assay using SARS-CoV-2. The assay was performed in quadruplicate, and a series of

4

eight two-fold serial dilutions of the plasma or serum were assessed. Briefly, 100 tissue

5

culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) units of SARS-CoV-2 were added to two-fold serial

6

dilutions of heat-inactivated serum (60°C, 30 min), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The

7

virus – serum mixture was added to Vero E6 cells (3×105/well) grown in an ELISpot

8

plate and incubated for 3 d. The endpoint of the micro-neutralization assay was

9

designated as the highest serum dilution at which all three, or two of three, wells were not

protected from virus infection, as assessed by visual examination. The neutralizing titers

11

of the dilutions of sera were measured with the maximum dilution achieving the median

12

Investigation of cell-mediated immune response by IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot assay

14

Mouse IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot assay were conducted according to the

15

manufacturer’s guidelines (DaKeWe, Shenzhen, China). Briefly, splenocytes (3×105 per

16

well, in triplicate) of immunized mice at Day35 were plated into ELISpot plate and

17

stimulated with PHA (Positive control) or S1-4 protein. After incubation for 16 h in a

18

37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2, the cells were removed before adding the

19

detection antibody (biotin conjugate). Two hours later at room temperature (RT),

20

Streptavidin-HRP was added after washing plate. One hour later at RT, TMB substrate

21

was applied until distinct spots emerged. Count spots in an ELISpot reader after stopping

22

color development with deionized water.

Statistical analysis

2

Antibody titers were log-transformed to establish geometric mean titers (GMT) for

3

analysis. The number of specific IFN-γ- or IL-4-secreting T cells were expressed as spots

4

forming cells (SFCs) per 3 × 105 cells. The related data were statistically analyzed by

5

Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric data and the paired t test for parametric data.

6

SPSS software (22.0, Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism software (8.00, San Diego,

7

CA, USA) was applied to analyze the data and draw graphics, respectively. Significance

8

was indicated when value of P < 0.05.
