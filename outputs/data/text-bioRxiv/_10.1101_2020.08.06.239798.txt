27

The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide resulting in the

28

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Limited information on the underlying immune

29

mechanisms that drive disease or protection during COVID-19 severely hamper development of

30

therapeutics and vaccines. Thus, the establishment of relevant animal models that mimic the

31

pathobiology of the disease is urgent. Rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit

32

disease pathobiology similar to human COVID-19, thus serving as a relevant animal model. In

33

the current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of

34

juvenile and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that genes

35

associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways

36

are significantly induced in macaque infected lungs, while pathways associated with collagen

37

formation are downregulated. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor

38

prognosis and increased mortality. We demonstrate that Type I IFN and Notch signaling pathways

39

are significantly upregulated in lungs of juvenile infected macaques when compared with old

40

infected macaques. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil counts

41

and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast, pathways

42

involving VEGF are downregulated in lungs of old infected macaques. Using samples from

43

humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, we validate a subset of our findings. Finally,

44

neutrophil degranulation, innate immune system and IFN gamma signaling pathways are

45

upregulated in both tuberculosis and COVID-19, two pulmonary diseases where neutrophils are

46

associated with increased severity. Together, our transcriptomic studies have delineated disease

47

pathways to improve our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to facilitate the

48

design of new therapeutics for COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

52

COVID-19, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

53

2), emerged as a pandemic disease during the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. In the absence

54

of a specific treatment or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, infected individuals develop symptoms

55

associated with a cytokine storm (1). This cytokine storm can initiate viral sepsis and

56

inflammation-induced lung injury which lead to other complications including pneumonitis, acute

57

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, shock, organ failure and potentially

58

death (1, 2).

59

By combining established principles of anti-viral immunity with analysis of immune responses in

60

COVID-19 patients, a picture of the host defense response against SARS-CoV-2 is beginning to

61

emerge (3, 4). Upon infection of the mucosal epithelium, SARS-CoV-2 is detected by intracellular

62

pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that bind viral RNA and DNA. PRR signaling triggers

63

activation of transcription factors and induces Interferon (IFN) signaling, which in turn activates

64

resident macrophages. Infected macrophages induce cytokine secretion that consequently

65

triggers recruitment of myeloid cells, likely resulting in a feed-back loop that aggravates

66

immunopathogenesis and promotes disease progression.

67

Analyses of transcriptomic response of host cells upon virus infection have potential to identify

68

the host immune response dynamics and gene activated regulatory networks (5, 6). Recent

69

studies have reported transcriptional changes in cells in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and

70

peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients (7). Single cell RNA-seq has

71

recently identified initial cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection in model organisms (8) and

72

patients (9) and characterized peripheral and local immune responses in severe COVID-19 (10),

73

with severe disease being associated with a cytokine storm and increased neutrophil

74

accumulation. However, most of these studies have mostly been performed in peripheral blood

75

samples from a limited number of moderate or severe COVID-19 patients within limited age

76

ranges (10). To overcome the limitations associated with obtaining samples from human subjects

77

and to get more in-depth understanding of the transcriptional changes during COVID-19, we have

78

developed a SARS-CoV-2 macaque model, where both juvenile and old macaques were infected

79

and exhibited clinical symptoms that reflect human COVID-19 disease that is self-limited. In the

80

current study, we have characterized the transcriptional signatures induced in the lungs of juvenile

81

and old rhesus macaques following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that genes

82

associated with Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways

83

are significantly induced in the lungs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, this is

84

associated with a downregulation of genes associated with collagen formation and regulation of

85

collagen pathways. In COVID-19, increasing age is a significant risk factor for poor prognosis of

86

infection(11). We demonstrate that specific immune pathways, namely Type I IFN and Notch

87

signaling, are significantly upregulated in juvenile macaques when compared with old macaques

88

infected with SARS-CoV-2. These results are corroborated with increased peripheral neutrophil

89

counts and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio in older individuals with COVID-19 disease. In contrast,

90

the VEGF pathway is downregulated in old infected macaques. Incidently, levels of VEGF protein

91

are increased in plasma of older COVID-19 patients, emphasizing the importance of studying both

92

local and peripheral responses. Finally, we report that neutrophil degranulation, innate immune

93

system and IFN gamma (IFN-g) signaling pathways are upregulated in both tuberculosis (TB) and

94

COVID-19, two pulmonary infectious diseases where neutrophils accumulation is associated with

95

increased severity. Together, our study has delineated disease pathways that can serve as a

96

valuable tool in understanding the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and

97

progressive COVID-19, and facilitate the design of therapeutics for COVID-19.

RESULTS

183

Genes up-regulated in COVID-19 infected macaques represent pathways characteristic of

184

neutrophil degranulation and IFN signaling

185

We recently assessed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect rhesus macaques during a longitudinal

186

two week infection study. This study included the effect of age on the progression of infection to

187

COVID-19. Indian-origin, SPF-rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were infected by multiple

188

routes (ocular, intratracheal and intranasal) with sixth-passage virus at a target dose of 1.05x106

189

PFU/per animal and studied for two weeks. The macaques were grouped as naïve (uninfected),

190

and infected (juvenile or old) macaques. All infected animals developed clinical signs of viral

191

infection(12) (in review). Both juvenile and old macaques exhibited comparable clinical disease,

192

and equivalent longitudinal viral loads in the BAL, nasopharyngeal and buccopharyngeal swabs,

193

as well as lungs at endpoint. This was followed by comparable viral clearance. In order to fully

194

understand the immune pathways regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, RNA was extracted and

195

RNA sequencing was carried out from a lung biopsy from juvenile macaques (n = 3, 1 male and

196

2 females) and old macaques infected with infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 5, 1 male and 4

197

females) and naive uninfected macaques (n = 4, 2 males and 2 females). An average of 68.6

198

million reads were generated, with an average of 20.3 million fragments (read pairs or orphaned

199

reads) mapping to macaque coding sequences, following analytical processing and mapping

200

(Table S1). Principal components analysis (PCA) based on whole-transcriptome gene expression

201

levels(19) showed that despite within-group variability for the COVID-19 infected samples, the

202

naive samples grouped separately, suggesting substantial overall transcriptomic differences

203

resulting from the infection (Figure 1A). Differential gene expression analysis (DESeq2(19)) with

204

the juvenile and old COVID-19 samples grouped together identified 1,026 genes significantly (P

205

≤ 0.01) up-regulated in response to infection, while 1,109 genes were significantly downregulated

206

(Figure 1B). Expression, annotation and differential expression data for all genes is available in

207

Table S2. Complete lists of differentially expressed genes for each comparison of interest

208

(described below) ranked by P value, with Z-scores for expression visualization are available in

209

Table S3, and significant pathway enrichment (Reactome(21), KEGG(23) and Gene

210

Ontology(24)) for all comparisons is shown in Table S4.

211

Evaluation of the top 30 most significantly up-regulated genes in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-

212

infected macaques revealed significantly higher expression of CTSG (Cathepsin G),

213

ATP6AP2(ATPase H+ transporting accessory protein 2), IFNgR1 (Interferon Gamma Receptor),

214

CD36 and CD58, in comparison to expression in uninfected macaque lungs (Figure 2A).

215

Cathepsin G is a serine protease prominently found in neutrophilic granules. IFNgR1 associates

216

with IFNgR2 to form a receptor for the cytokine interferon gamma (IFNg)(26-29), and required for

217

activation of antiviral responses, such as IRF3 (IFN regulatory factor-3), nuclear factor KB (NF-

218

KB) and JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling

219

pathways (30). Reactome pathway analysis on up- and down-regulated genes in the lungs of

220

SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques showed that genes significantly up-regulated by

221

infection, included pathway enrichment for genes involved in “Neutrophil degranulation”, “Innate

222

Immune system”, “Immune system” and “IFN signaling” (Table 1; Table S4A). The up-regulation

223

of CD36 during COVID-19 in lungs is in conformity with these enriched pathways, since CD36, a

224

scavenger receptor expressed in multiple cell types, mediates lipid uptake, immunological

225

recognition, inflammation, molecular adhesion, and apoptosis (31), and is a Matrix

226

Metalloproteinase-9 substrate that induces neutrophil apoptosis. CD58 molecule (lymphocyte

227

function-associated antigen-3) is expressed on human hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic

228

cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages and endothelial cells (32-35), and interacts with its

229

receptor CD2 molecule (36, 37) on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells to mediate

230

cytotoxic reactions (38-40). The complete ranked list of the 1,026 genes upregulated during

231

COVID-19 is shown in Table S3A.

232

ATP6AP2 was the most significantly up-regulated of the 65 genes upregulated within the enriched

233

“neutrophil degranulation” (R-HSA-6798695) pathway (Table S3B), and it interacts with renin or

234

prorenin to cause activation of intracellular signaling pathways, resulting in secretion of

235

inflammatory and fibrotic factors(41). CEACAM8 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen-Related Cell

236

Adhesion Molecule 8) is the gene that encodes for CD66b, a well characterized marker of

237

degranulation(42). Indeed, CD66b+ neutrophils accumulate in the lungs of macaques infected

238

with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2C). We have also previously demonstrated that neutrophils are

239

heavily recruited early to the alveolar space following SARS-CoV-2 infection of macaques(12) (in

240

review). Additional genes strongly up-regulated during COVID-19 in the neutrophil degranulation

241

pathway are IDH-1(Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 1) which regulates neutrophil

242

chemotaxis, and FPR2 (Formyl Peptide Receptor 2), a G-coupled surface receptor which has a

243

deleterious role to play in viral infection including influenza (43). LTA4H (Leukotriene A4

244

hydrolase) is an enzyme that generates a neutrophil chemoattractant, leukotriene B4, a marker

245

for ARDS(44). Expression of 162 genes belonging to the “immune system” (R-HSA-168256)

246

pathway was upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected macaques (Table S3C). These included

247

LAMP-2(Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 2), and ATG7 (Autophagy Related 7), key

248

genes involved in autophagy. LAMP-2 is known to influence phagosomal maturation in neutrophil

249

(45). The IFN response constitutes the major first line of defense against viruses. Consistent with

250

this, we found up-regulation of genes associated with the IFN signaling pathways, specifically

251

Interferon Induced Protein with Tetratricopeptide Repeats 1 (IFIT3), IFN alpha receptor 1

252

(IFNAR1),

253

Oligoadenylate Synthetase 1). Together, these results suggest that upregulation of neutrophil

254

degranulation, Type I IFN signaling, and innate immune system is a characteristic feature of host

responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

are severe (46). A well-documented sequela of ARDS is the development of fibrotic disease (47,

261

48). We found that the 1,109 genes downegulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques were

262

significantly enriched for collagen degradation, regulation and formation (Figure 2B; Table 2;

263

Table S3D; Table S4B). For example, among the “collagen degradation” (R-HSA-1442490)

264

enriched pathway (Table S3E), COLA1 (collagen type I chain), other members of the collagen

265

gene family (COL4A2 COL16A1 COL4A4 COL6A2 COL6A1 COL5A1 COL9A1 COL13A1

266

COL12A1 COL1A2) and Matrix metalloproteases such as MMP23B (Matrix Metallopeptidase

267

23B), MMP15 and MMP14 were all significantly dowregulated in COVID-19 diseased lungs when

268

compared with expression in lungs of uninfected controls. Additionally, Reactome pathway

269

enrichment prominently featured pathways down-regulated in COVID-19 disease in macaques

270

comprised of “collagen degradation”, “collagen chain trimerization”, “degradation of extracellular

271

matrix” and “collagen formation” (Table 2). Increased collagen degradation is essential for the

272

prevention of fibrosis, a sequelae of COVID-19 and ARDS. Therefore, regulation of collagen

273

degradation and extracellular matrix modeling suggest that this may be a feature of SARS-CoV-

274

2 infection of rhesus macaques being a self-limiting model with early and robust anamnestic

275

responses. TGFβ (Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1) is involved in normal tissue repair

276

following lung injury, and in mediating fibrotic tissue remodeling by increasing the production and

277

decreasing the degradation of connective tissue (49). Our results indicate a downregulation of

278

genes associated with TGFβ signaling (Table 2), including the genes PARD3 (par-3 family cell

279

polarity regulator) and PARD6A (par-6 family cell polarity regulator alpha), which are involved in

280

regulating epithelial cell apico-basolateral polarization, SMURF (SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin

281

protein ligase 1), a negative regulator of TGFβ pathway, and FURIN, which is a TGFβ converting

enzyme (Table S3F). While the interaction of the genes within these pathways is complex, our

283

results project a broad downregulation of mechanisms that contribute to lung repair and

284

remodeling in animals with anamnestic control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Type I interferon signaling and Notch signaling pathways are upregulated in young

287

macaques but not old macaques with COVID-19 disease

288

Age is a significant risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 disease (11). In

289

order to identify the differential immune responses associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in old

290

macaques, we carried out differential expression analysis between the groups; namely between

291

juvenile (n=3) vs naive (n=4), and old (n=5) vs naive (n=4). In order for a gene to be considered

292

to be differentially expressed only in the juvenile macaques, we required a stringent P value for

293

significance ≤ 0.01 in the juvenile COVID-19 vs naive, and a P value for significance ≥ 0.1 in the

294

old COVID-19 vs naive comparison. This approach identified 86 genes significantly up-regulated

295

(Figure 3A; Table S3G) and 96 genes significantly down-regulated (Figure 3B; Table S3H) with

296

COVID-19 disease only in juveniles. Note that no genes were significantly upregulated in juveniles

297

and significantly downregulated in old, and vice-versa. Of these genes, the top 30 most

298

significantly differential between juvenile and old are shown for up-regulated genes in Figure 4A

299

and for down-regulated genes in Figure 4B. No pathways were found to be significantly enriched

300

among the 96 genes significantly downregulated only in juveniles, but the Reactome and KEGG

301

pathways significantly enriched among the 86 genes upregulated only in juveniles are shown in

302

Table 3. Complete gene lists per pathway, and all significant pathways enrichment results

303

including for Gene Ontology (GO) are available in Table S4C.

304

The genes with significantly upregulated expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected juvenile but not old

305

macaques included MX1 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1), MX2 (MX Dynamin Like GTPase 2) and

306

USP18 (Ubiquitin Specific Peptidase 18) (Figure 5). This is consistent with and highlights the role

307

of the Reactome pathway “interferon alpha/beta signaling” being enriched in juvenile macaques

308

during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3, Table S4C). Other genes in this pathway which exhibited

309

increased expression included IFIT1 and IFIT2. Additionally, by KEGG analysis, the Notch

310

signaling pathway was observed to be significantly upregulated in juvenile infected macaques

311

when compared with old infected macaques. ADAM17 (ADAM Metallopeptidase Domain 17), a

312

key component of the Notch signaling pathways is known to be involved in shedding of the surface

313

protein ACE2 (Angiotensin converting enzyme 2) (50). Therefore, it is interesting that a linear

314

correlation in the expression of ACE2 and ADAM17 exists in infected macaques (Figure 4C).

315

Note that we also see a significant upregulation of ACE2 across all samples (4.2-fold, P = 4.9x10-

316

3

317

Additionally, the induction of DLL4, a Notch ligand, was increased in the infected juvenile

318

macaques. Finally, the differential induction of DTX3L (Deltex E3 Ubiquitin Ligase 3L) in juvenile

319

infected macaques compared to old infected macaques is important because Deltex stabilizes

320

the receptor in the endocytic compartment allowing signal transduction to proceed in Notch

321

signaling(52). Of the Hepatitis-induced pathway genes that are upregulated in juvenile COVID-19

322

diseased lungs, CXCL-10 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10) is a chemokine associated with

323

severe disease in COVID-19 in humans (53), but can also be involved in recruitment of CXCR3

324

(C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 3) expressing immune cells. 14-3-3 (otherwise called YWHAG)

325

interacts with MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5), which belongs to the RIG-I-

326

like receptor family and drive anti-viral immunity. Together, these results suggest that specific

327

pathways including Type I IFN and Notch signaling are highly induced in juvenile macaques

328

during SARS-CoV-2 infection, when compared to similarly infected old macaques.

), and a substantially larger upregulation among the juvenile samples (7.1-fold, P = 3.4x10-4).

Genes related to VEGF signaling are downregulated in old macaques but not juvenile

331

macaques during COVID-19-disease

332

Using the same approach as for the juvenile macaque-specific differentially regulated genes, we

333

identified 97 genes significantly up-regulated (Figure 3A; Table S3I) and 160 genes significantly

334

down-regulated (Figure 3B; Table S3J) with COVID-19 disease only in infected old macaques,

335

and not infected juveniles. Pathway enrichment analysis only identified significant functional

336

enrichment among the down-regulated gene set (Table 4; Table S4D). Our results show that in

337

the lungs of old macaques, the only Reactome pathways enriched among genes downregulated

338

during COVID-19 included genes involved in the “VEGF-VEGFR2 Pathway” and “Signaling by

339

VEGF” (Figure 6, 7). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signaling protein that

340

promotes angiogenesis, and is a key factor that promotes ARDS. Previous research showed that

341

ACE2 antagonizes and down-regulates VEGFA(54), improving lung function following acute lung

342

injury (55). Here, we observe both a significant increase in ACE2 in response to COVID-19 and

343

a significant decrease in VEGF pathways in old macaques, which may be due to this antagonistic

344

relationship. VEGFA, p21-activated kinase (PAK2), cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (SRC),

345

RhoA/ROCK signaling [ROCK1(Rho Associated Coiled-Coil Containing Protein Kinase 1) and

346

WASF2(WASP Family Member 2) are all essential for multiple aspects of VEGF-mediated

347

angiogenesis and are all significantly downregulated in old macaques with COVID-19 (Figure 7).

348

Overall, despite juvenile and old macaques having a comparable clinical course with resolution,

349

our data suggest that there are significant differenes in signaling pathways, especially those

350

related to VEGF signaling that may ultimately result in differences is long term outcomes. Thus,

351

our results suggest that down-regulation of VEGF pathways is associated with increasing age, in

352

a macaque cohort of self-limiting disease model, and protect from serious lung injury during

353

COVID-19 disease.

354

Aged COVID-19 patients exhibit increased plasma VEGF protein levels and high peripheral

356

To further address if our findings were relevant in the human setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we

357

stratified COVID-19 patients into aged group (>60 years) and a group of COVID-19 patients <60

358

years (Table S5). We found that with increasing age, there were increased association of disease

359

parameters and comorbidities (Table S5). We measured the levels of human plasma proteins

360

levels for IFN-α, IFN-b and IFN-g. While levels of plasma IFN-α, and IFN-b were below the levels

361

of reliable detection, we found that the COVID-19 patients who were <60 years expressed

362

significantly higher plasma IFN-g levels when compared to levels in plasma of healthy controls

363

(Fig. 8A). Although plasma levels of IFN-g protein was also increased in aged

364

COVID-19 patient group, levels were not significantly different from healthy controls (Fig. 8A).

365

This was in contrast to plasma protein levels of VEGF, which was significantly higher in aged

366

individuals with COVID-19 disease when compared with levels in individuals with COVID-19

367

disease who were <60 years old (Fig. 8B). The increased levels of VEGF in aged COVID-19

368

patients coincided with significantly increased peripheral neutrophil counts as well as increased

369

peripheral neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, when compared with both healthy controls and COVID-

370

19 group <60 years old (Fig. 8C,D). These results show that plasma protein levels of VEGF and

371

accumulation of peripheral neutrophils is increased in aged individuals with COVID-19 disease,

372

when compared to younger individuals with COVID-19 disease.

373

Neutrophil degranulation and IFN pathways overlap between COVID-19 and TB disease.

374

Tuberculosis (TB) is a pulmonary granulomatous disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium

375

tuberculosis. TB disease in humans and macaques is associated with a neutrophil and IFN

376

signature(13). Thus, we next compared and contrasted the transcriptional profile of genes and

377

pathways that are shared by the two diseases, and those that are unique to COVID-19.There was

378

not a substantial overlap between differentially expressed genes in response to COVID-19 and

379

TB. However, of the 97 genes that were commonly upregulated in TB and COVID-19 (Figure

380

9A, Table S3K), the Reactome pathway enrichment was well featured in “Neutrophil

381

degranulation”, “Innate immune response”, and “Interferon gamma signaling” (Figure 9B, Table

382

S4E). Nearly as many genes (76) had opposite differential expression patterns (upregulated in

383

COVID-19, downregulated in TB), as genes upregulated in both (Figure 10A, Table S3L). These

384

genes were associated with blood vessel morphogenesis and angiogenesis including leptin

385

receptor (LEPR), TGFb2 (Figure 10B, Table S4F). These results suggest that both TB and

386

COVID-19 share features of neutrophil accumulation of IFN signaling, but that COVID-19 disease

387

immunopathogenesis uniquely features vascularization of the lung.

388
389

DISCUSSION

390

Lack of understanding of the complexity of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis hampers

391

identification of therapeutic strategies for COVID-19. While studies using immune profiling in

392

COVID-19 patients have shed light on related immune mechanisms of this disease, these have

393

primarily involved peripheral samples obtained from moderate to severe COVID-19 patients, who

394

are generally also older. To overcome these limitations, we have generated a nonhuman primate

395

model (rhesus macaques) of SARS-CoV-2 infection that reflects several features of the

396

immunopathogenesis of human COVID-19, and provides a platform to interrogate the immune

397

pathways that mediate disease versus protection, especially in the context of young versus older

398

hosts. In this study, we show that upregulation of pathways characteristic of neutrophil

399

degranulation and IFN signaling are characteristic of COVID-19 disease in infected hosts.

400

Importantly, the significantly higher induction of genes associated with Type I IFN signaling

401

pathway and Notch signaling in young macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 is a key determinant

402

that distinguishes them from infected old macaques. Lungs of old macaques infected with COVID-

403

19 however, uniquely feature downregulation of VEGF signaling pathways. Importantly, in PBMCs

404

of humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 we found increased levels of VEGF and peripheral

405

neutrophil counts in individuals >60 years when compared to younger individuals. These results

406

together provide novel insights into the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 disease, especially

407

from the unique perceptive of age as a contributing factor.

408

As we learn more about the pathophysiology of COVID-19, it is becoming clear that disease

409

severity is associated with hyperinflammation which in turn induces lung and multiorgan injury

410

and mortality via a cytokine storm (1, 2, 56). While therapeutic options that focus on

411

immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids are being considered and used, a risk exits

412

that immunomodulators may also inhibit protective pathways. Therefore, a thorough

413

understanding of the host inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed before

414

precise immunomodulators can be specifically designed to limit inflammation without regulating

415

protective mechanisms of action. The distinct role of myeloid cells in COVID-19 lung injury and

416

immunopathogenesis is just beginning to be described, and we have clearly shown that

417

neutrophils are intensely recruited to the lung compartment in macaques after SARS-CoV-2

418

infection (12) (in review). Neutrophils can play a protective role contributing to early antiviral

419

defense (57), but also can be pathological due to processes associated with degranulation and

420

lysis, thereby promoting lung inflammation. Consistent with this notion, in current COVID-19

421

literature, an increased peripheral neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is observed in severe COVID-

422

19 cases, and in some studies is also associated with unfavorable prognosis (58). These results

423

in human studies are consistent with our macaque studies that describe neutrophil degranulation

424

as one of the top transcriptional pathways up-regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 macaques when

425

compared to uninfected controls. In this regard, expression of Cathepsin G is northworthy since

426

it is prominent serine protease that amplifies inflammation by stimulating the production of

427

cytokines and chemokines that drive immune cell recruitment to the lung (59), and activates

428

metalloproteases to cleave extracellular matrix proteins, thereby promoting neutrophil migration

429

(60). Cathepsin G also induces potent chemotactic recruitment of monocytes, neutrophils and

430

antigen presenting cells in addition to promoting endothelial and epithelial permeability (61). The

431

latter function of Cathepsin G could be important in enhancing viral invasion to extra-alveolar sites

432

while increased epithelial permeability might also explain the gastrointestinal route of transmission

433

(12) (in review). Additionally, ATP6AP2, causes secretion of inflammatory and fibrotic factors

434

(41), CD36, that induces neutrophil apoptosis, and CECAM8 whose cross-linking induces IL-8

435

production , all of which are highly expressed in COVID-19 diseased lungs. In patients with severe

436

COVID-19, neutrophils express higher frequency of CD66b+ neutrophils(62). These different

437

genes that are up-regulated as part of the neutrophil degranulation/innate immune response

438

pathways suggest a prominent role for neutrophils that can promote inflammation and a cytokine

439

storm leading to COVID-19 disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, our studies shed light on the

440

importance of the membrane glycoprotein, CD36 in the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CD36

441

is expressed on platelets, macrophages and even epithelial cells. In addition to its well

442

characterized apoptotic function, CD36 is also a receptor for thrombospondin-1 and related

443

proteins and can function as a negative regulator of angiogenesis(78). This is particularly

444

important given that angiogenesis is an important feature in patients with COVID-19 and

445

associated ARDS (79). CD36 also binds long-chain fatty acids and facilitates their transport into

446

cells, leading to muscle utilization, coupled with fat storage. This contributes to the pathogenesis

447

of metabolic disorders, such as diabetes and obesity and atherothrombotic disease (79). A recent

448

single-cell analysis revealed significantly higher CD36 expression in association with ACE2-

449

expressing human lung epithelia cells (80). Increased CD36 expression may therefore provide a

450

protective role from extreme lung injury during COVID-19, which is observed in the macaques.

451

Our novel findings that CD36 (as well as other prominent signaling pathways) may be involved in

452

the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has implicaitons for host-direc ted therapy for SARS-CoV-2

453

infection. In contrast, neutrophils are recruited into the lung very early following macaque infection

454

with SARS-CoV-2(12) (in review). Additionally, in lungs of deceased individuals with severe

455

COVID-19 disease neutrophil infiltration occurred in pulmonary capillaries and was accompanied

456

with extravasation of neutrophils into the alveolar space, and neutrophilic mucositis(63). In the

457

case of COVID-19, neutrophils could also be a source of excess neutrophil extracellular traps

458

(64). Cytokine storm characterized by increased plasma concentrations of IL1β, IL2, IL6, IL7, IL8,

459

IL10, IL17, IFNγ, IFNγ-inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), G-CSF,

460

macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and TNFα seen in severe COVID-19 patients can regulate

461

neutrophil activity by upregulating the expression of chemoattractants that recruit myeloid cells to

462

the lung. These results are also consistent with upregulation of pathways associated with immune

463

and innate signaling, especially IFN signaling. These results together suggest a scenario in the

464

lung where induction of the cytokine storm drives the recruitment of neutrophils, thereby

465

contributing to inflammation. Thus, degranulation of neutrophils and formation of NETs may

466

further promote cytokine responses and inflammation and disease immunopathogenesis.

467

The IFN response constitutes the major first line of defense against viruses. Recognition of viral

468

infections by innate immune sensors activates both the type I and type III IFN response. While

469

some studies have shown that serum of COVID-19 patients contains increased expression of pro-

470

inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, without detectable levels of type I and III IFNs(65), other

471

studies suggest that the IFN response may be delayed. Importantly, elevated IFNs correlate with

472

more severe disease(66, 67). However, it is not fully clear if type I IFNs are protective or

473

pathological in COVID-19(68). Thus, it is possible that severe infection drives the higher

474

expression of genes in the IFN pathways, but may not lead to viral containment, but instead drives

475

pathological damage. On the other hand, increased induction of type I IFN signaling pathways in

476

SARS-CoV-2 infected macaques, as well as increased induction in juvenile macaques, could

477

support a role for IFN signaling in protection rather than disease progression. Our studies provide

478

data to support the recently proposed hypothesis that that IFN induction may be compromised in

479

older hosts(68). When the early IFN response is not optimal to control viral infection, it is possible

480

that delayed or inadequate IFN responses may lead to inflammation mediated damage. Not all

481

animal models, especially mice fully mimic the spectrum of human disease caused by SARS-

482

CoV-2, likely due to the regulatory responses of IFNs on viral entry receptors such as ACE2 which

483

are differentially regulated in humans compared to mice. Further testing the protective versus

484

pathological roles of IFNs in the macaque model with the availability of IFNAR blocking reagents

485

should further clarify the specific role of IFN pathways in COVID-19.

486

ARDS in influenza, MERS and SARS have been associated with fibrotic irreversible interstitial

487

lung disease(69, 70). Pulmonary fibrosis is a recognized sequelae of ARDS(47). Pulmonary

488

fibrosis can develop either following chronic inflammation or as a consequence of genetically

489

associated and age-related fibroproliferative process, as in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

490

(IPF)(71). Fibrosis is the hardening, and/or scarring of tissues due to excess deposition of

491

extracellular matrix components including collagen. Fibrosis is often the terminal result of

492

inflammatory insults induced by infections, autoimmune or allergic responses and others. It is

493

thought that the mechanisms driving fibrogenesis are divergent from those modulating

494

inflammation. The key cellular mediator of fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of fibrous

495

connective tissue (components of the ECM such as collagen and fibronectin) in and around

496

inflamed or damaged tissue. Since a significant proportion of COVID-19 patients develop severe

497

ARDS, it is predicted that a similar outcome of fibrosis will be associated with COVID-19. Also,

498

since the risk factors associated with COVID-19 including increasing age, male and associated

499

co-morbidities coincide with IPF risk factors, it is expected that COVID-19 patients will experience

500

fibrotic lung disease. Despite these associations, there is no evidence currently that “scarring of

501

the lung” experienced by COVID-19 patients is fibrotic or progressive and an outcome of COVID-

502

19 disease post recovery. Therefore, our results provide unique insights into the role of fibrosis

503

during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most notably, we find significant downregulation of collagen

504

degradation pathways, as well as pathways associated with collagen formation, collagen

505

trimerization and assembly. Furthermore, the role for TGF-b and ECM degradation is well

506

documented in fibrosis. Indeed, the genes associated with these pathways are also significantly

507

down-regulated. These results for the first time provide novel insights into the early pathological

508

events occurring during COVID-19 in the lungs with relevance to underlying immune mechanisms

509

associated with canonical fibrosis pathways. While long term consequences of the pulmonary

510

COVID-19 such as fibrosis remain to be determined, our results on down-regulation of collagen

511

degradation and TGF-b pathways may represent important early events on the lungs of SARS-

512

CoV-2 infected individuals.

513

progression to ARDS and fibrosis, while it is possible that in individuals with early activation of

514

collagen degradation progress more severe outcomes may ensue.

515

Finally, we provide novel insights into the transcriptional regulation of immune pathways that are

516

induced and regulated by age, an important risk factor for COVID-19 disease and outcome. This

517

is a significant component of risk for disease and prognosis of COVID-19. We find higher induction

518

of genes associated with Type I IFN signaling and Notch signaling in the old mecaque. Up-

regulation of these significant Type I IFN signaling genes suggest that in a model of self-limited

520

clinical disease in macaques, Type I IFN induction may be differentially regulated by age-

521

associated factors. Age-specific regulation of this pathway has been demonstrated in the murine

522

model of TB(72). There is also a well-documented relationship between Notch signaling and viral

523

infections. For example, Human Papilloma Virus and Simian Virus 40 can highjack the cellular

524

machinery, including components of Notch signaling, and these events re associated with cancer

525

progression(73). Most studies thus far have only followed SARS-CoV-2 infected macaque for up

526

to two weeks, and it was initially thought that this virus causes acute infection. However, details

527

are now emerging from both animal models(12) (in review) and patients, that the virus can persist

528

for longer periods, leading to persistent shedding from tissues, and exhaustion of adaptive

529

responses. While innate and T cell responses are comparable between juvenile and old

530

macaques following infection, SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody is generated at significantly higher

531

levels in the plasma of juveniles, relative to old macaques(12) (in review). Since Notch signaling

532

regulates multiple stages of B-cell differentiation and shapes the antibody repertoire(74), higher

533

expression of many of the Notch pathway member genes in juvenile macaques may be

534

responsible for the development of stronger antibody responses in these animals, impacting

We speculate that such events may protect individuals from

535

disease progression. Alternatively, it is possible that the differences in Notch signaling and

536

production of virus-specific antibody between jouvenile and old macaques may impact disease

537

progression over a longer period of time, or be particularly relevant in models of co-morbidity,

538

such as diabetes. Similarly, Type I IFN responses are critical for the downstream breadth of

539

antibody production and recognition (75-77). Thus, while T cell responses are comparable in

540

juvenile and old macaques, differences in critical signaling pathways uncovered by our RNA-seq

541

analysis potentially explain why juvenile macaques mount significantly stronger antibody

542

responses, and consequently why younger subjects have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19.

543

While this has not been recapitulated in the macaque model, older patients of COVID-19 are more

544

susceptible to progression. This is consistent with increased disease progression when COVID-

545

19 patients were stratified based on age. A previous study found that peripheral VEGF

546

concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls(81). We

547

also find this effect in our human samples (Figure 8B) where people with COVID-19 that are older

548

than 60 years of age have more VEGF protein in their peripheral blood. However, we also find

549

significantly lower levels of VEGF pathway gene transcripts in the lungs of macaques with SARS-

550

CoV-2 infection, especially older macaques (Figure 6, 7). Our study further demonstrates that the

551

changes in VEGF signaling may be associated with increasing age rather than just with disease

552

severity. VEGF pathways promote angiogenesis and induce vascular leakiness and permeability.

553

Our results therefore suggest that higher levels of VEGF in the periphery, while a biomarker for

554

COVID-19, may be driven as a compensatory mechanism due to lower levels of VEGF signaling

555

at the site of infection, i.e, the lung. These results further underscore the value of studying

556

responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung compartment. By uncovering new aspects of the

557

role of these signaling pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung compared to the periphery

558

using animal models and human samples, will shed further light on pathways that can be

559

harnessed for therapeutics for COVID-19 disease.

TB and COVID-19 both primarily affect lung function. TB was already one of the leading causes

561

of death due to an infectious disease prior to emergence of COVID-19. In the current scenario

562

the clinical management of both TB and COVID together, particularly in the endemic regions is

563

another rapidly emerging healthcare challenge needing immediate attention. In order to properly

564

address the solution for this emerging crisis a better understanding of the comparative

565

immunological manifestations of both the diseases must be understood. Our results are the first

566

to clearly demarcate the main differences in the manifestation of both the diseases in the alveolar

567

niche. Neutrophil degranulation was one of the most significantly enriched pathways in both the

568

disease conditions and therefore appears as a promising druggable target for efficient

569

management of severe co-morbid TB COVID-19 condition. However, the selective enrichment of

570

angiogenesis and vascular permeability in observed in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected

571

macaques is not seen in models, or patients of TB. These results have the potential to generate

572

additional, specific druggable targets for COVID-19.

573

Overall, we interrogated transcriptional profiles of lungs from juvenile and old macaques infected

574

with SARS-CoV-2. This study has provided fundamentally new information on the host response

575

in young and old macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2, a model that provides relevant insights

576

necessary for further vaccine and therapeutic development for COVID-19 and a subset of these

577

observations confirmed in human samples with control of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as

578

COVID-19 disease, and as a function of age.
