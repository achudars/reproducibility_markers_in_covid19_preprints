Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 unprecedentedly threatens the public health at worldwide level. There is an urgent need to
develop an effective vaccine within a highly accelerated time. Here, we present the most comprehensive Sprotein-based linear B-cell epitope candidate list by combining epitopes predicted by eight widely-used
immune-informatics methods with the epitopes curated from literature published between Feb 6, 2020 and July
10, 2020. We find four top prioritized linear B-cell epitopes in the hotspot regions of S protein can specifically
bind with serum antibodies from horse, mouse, and monkey inoculated with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
candidates or a patient recovering from COVID-19. The four linear B-cell epitopes can induce neutralizing
antibodies against both pseudo and live SARS-CoV-2 virus in immunized wild-type BALB/c mice. This study
suggests that the four linear B-cell epitopes are potentially important candidates for serological assay or
vaccine development.

Introduction
The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 with documented person-to-person transmission has caused millions of
confirmed cases and poses unprecedented threat to human lives1-3. The clinical features associated with SARSCoV-2 infection include non-symptomatic infection, mild flu-like symptoms to pneumonia, severe acute
respiratory distress syndrome or even deaths3,4. It has been declared as a pandemic by World Health
Organization (WHO) on 11th March, 2020. To date, no effective treatment is available yet, even though great
efforts are being put into the discovery of antiviral drugs. There is an urgent need to understand and develop
vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
At present, more than one hundred of vaccine development projects being carried out globally ranged from
viral vector-based vaccines, mRNA and DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, nano-particle-based vaccines, to
inactivated-whole virus vaccines5-8. Some vaccine candidates such as inactivated vaccine can inhibit virus
replication and protect against upper respiratory tract disease, and other vaccine candidates such as Ad5-nCoV
encoding the full spike of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate good characteristics in both safety and immunogenicity5-9.
However, some mild and self-limiting adverse reactions are still observed in some clinical trials10. It is
necessary to carefully evaluate the effects and side-effects of these vaccine candidates, and meanwhile to have
ongoing new vaccine development.
SARS-CoV-2 fuses and enters into the host cells through the spike (S) protein binding to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor11. It would be efficient to prevent virus entry by blocking the binding of
S protein to ACE212-14. The S protein consists of S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The
significant role of the S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the entry of virus to the host cell makes it
wildly-investigated target for developing therapeutic antibodies and vaccines15-17. Other area of S protein may
also elicit neutralizing antibodies18,19.
Various immune-informatics methods have been used to predict large quantities of linear B-cell epitopes with
high immunogenicity20-43, but the selection of the in-silicon methods is mostly based on the researchers’
experiences and preferences. Due to lack of validations from biological experiments, it is difficult to focus on a
limited number of candidates for diagnostics and linear B-cell epitope-based vaccine development.
In this study, we presented a comprehensive S-protein-based linear B-cell epitope candidate list by combining
epitopes predicted by eight widely-used immune-informatics methods with the epitopes curated from literature
published between Feb 6, 2020 and July 10, 2020. The antigenicity, toxicity, stability and physiochemical
properties were explored for all the identified linear B-cell epitopes. Based on integrative information from
epitopes properties and 3D structure of S protein, the top prioritized linear B-cell epitopes were investigated
for their binding affinity with serum antibodies from horse, mouse, and monkey inoculated with different
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (S1-based vaccine for horse, RBD-based vaccines for mouse and monkey)

and a patient recovering from COVID-19. The induction of neutralizing antibodies against both pseudo and
live SARS-CoV-2 virus has been examined following immunizations in wild-type BALB/c mice. Four linear
B-cell epitopes found able to elicit neutralizing antibodies are potentially important candidates for serological
assay or vaccine development.

Results
Identification of linear B-cell epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
Spike protein is an important target for vaccine development due to its indispensable function in helping
SARS-CoV-2 gain entry into host cells. B-cells can be guided through linear B-cell epitopes to recognize and
activate defense responses against viral infection. To construct a comprehensive linear B-cell epitope candidate
list, we first performed in-silicon prediction of B-cell epitopes from S protein through eight methods, obtaining
a total of 4044 linear B-cell epitopes (256 for Bepipred and Bepipred2.0 with default parameter settings,
Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fasman beta-turn, and Karplus and
Schulz flexibility provided by IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource)44; 128 for BcePred

using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, and turns;

3007 for the ANNpred-based server ABCpred46; 44 for Ellipro47; 176 for BCPREDS48; 191 for AAP49; 215 for
FBCPRED50; and 27 for COVIDep51). We additionally extracted 279 linear B-cell epitopes from 24 articles or
preprints19-43 published between Feb 6, 2020 and July 10, 2020. We finally established a full list of 3836
unique linear B-cell epitope candidates by combining predictions by the eight methods and those curated from
literature (Supplementary Table 1).
To obtain linear B-cell epitopes with high potential to initiate a defensive immune reaction, we adopted a
series of high stringent criteria to filter out epitopes with low antigenicity. 614 linear B-cell epitopes were
estimated by VaxiJen 2.052 to have high antigenicity scores (larger than 0.9 viewed adequate to initiate a
defensive immune reaction) (Fig. 1A) with length varying from 6 amino acids to 30 amino acids (Fig. 1B)
(Supplementary Table 1). The positions of the 614 linear B-cell epitopes on the S protein amino acid sequence
were examined to exclude the epitopes locating on the non-outer surface based on the transmembrane topology
of SARS-CoV-2 S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0 (outside:1-1213; transmembrane:1214-1236; inside:
1237-1273). A total of 14 regions locating on the outer surface of SARS-CoV-2 (4-32, 167-189, 369-402, 404431, 482-523, 526-563, 568-605, 628-678, 697-741, 890-916, 1027-1051, 1057-1081, 1155-1181, 1196-1213)
were identified as hotspot regions containing highly antigenic linear B-cell epitopes identified by multiple
methods (Fig. 1C). Based on the conservation status of each residue of the S protein predicted by ConSurf

(AFV53148.1), beta coronavirus OC43 (YP_009555241.1) and beta coronavirus HKU1 (AAT98580.1), we
discovered that RBD region (319-514) of the S protein was not conserved among the seven coronaviruses,
consistent with the observation that more mutations were found in the RBD region by performing sequence
alignment of S protein against 118,694 (20200927) sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in the NGDC database (Fig.
1C). The linear B-cell epitopes from the 14 hotspot regions were mapped to the 3D structure of the SARSCoV-2 S protein (PDB ID:6VSB), suggesting that hotspot regions locating on the exposed area of spike stem
or spike head would harbor good B-cell epitope candidates (Fig. 1D and E).

Characterization of the 18 linear B-cell epitopes selected with predicted high immunigenicity
From the hotspot regions of the exposed area of S protein, we selected 18 linear B-cell epitopes with few
mutations reported in less than ten out of a total of 118,694 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains as the potentially
optimal linear B-cell epitope candidates (Fig. 2A). As IgG and IgA are the most abundant isotypes in blood53,
we examined the recently available target profiles (20-mer peptides tiling every 5 amino acids across the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome) of IgG and IgA antibodies from 232 COVID-19 patient sera (101 for hospitalized,
131 for non-hospitalized) and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls 53. We discovered that the 20-mer peptides in
the target profiles with more than 75% overlapping with the 18 linear B-cell epitopes exhibited non-negligible
enrichment score in some hospitalized or non-hospitalized COVID-19 patient IgG, or IgA samples, suggesting
that the regions harboring the 18 linear B-cell epitopes have immunogenic potentials. Particularly, compared

To evaluate the stability of the 18 linear B-cell epitopes, we estimated the number of peptide-digesting
enzymes through the protein digest server with13 enzymes available (See Method). A linear B-cell epitope
would have potentially higher stability if more enzymes were predicted to be unable to digest it. All the 18
linear B-cell epitopes were found having at least two non-digesting enzymes varying from 2 to 12 enzymes
(Fig. 2B). The 18 linear B-cell epitopes were mapped to the 3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB
ID:

‘GQSKRVDFC’, and ‘VVFLHVTYV’ were in the spike stem region (Fig. 2C). The 12 linear B-cell epitopes
in the spike head were found to substantially overlap with the predicted interacting surface where ACE-2 binds
to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 2D)54-57, suggesting that an antibody binding to this surface may
block viral entry into cells. Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were also predicted by Discotope 2.0 using A, B,
and C chain of the 3D structure of S protein (PDB ID:6VSB). The positions of discontinuous B-cell epitopes
mapped on the 3D structure of S protein, revealing that RBD region is enriched with discontinuous B-cell
epitopes (Fig. 3E). Similarly, the discontinuous B-cell epitopes in the RBD regions overlapped with the
interacting surface between ACE2 and the RBD of S protein (Fig. 3F). The linear B-cell epitopes locating in

(Fig. 2A, E). By comparing the mutations documented in 53,969 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains (NGDC), we
discovered that eight linear B-cell epitopes in the RBD region incorporated one or two mutation sites in few
virus strains (C mutated in 11 virus strain for ‘QCVNLTT’; R mutated in one virus strain and Q mutated in 10

Four linear B-cell epitopes specifically binding with serum antibodies from the animals inoculated

Animal models are necessary to demonstrate efficacy and safety in the development of vaccines against SARSCoV-2 infection58,59. BALB/c mice is a good animal model for investigating SARS-CoV-2 infection in both
upper and lower respiratory tracts5. Monkey, phylogenetically close to humans, has been used to test whether
seroconversion provides protective immunity against SARS-CoV-258. To assess the binding of the 18 linear Bcell epitopes with serum IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we immunized three model animals including
horse, mouse, and monkey. Indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed between

the arbitrary control peptides had no effects. The normal sera from horse, mouse, monkey and human were not
reactive. In addition, sera from a patient recovering from COVID-19 and the healthy persons were provided by
Dr. Bin Su at Beijing Youan Hospital. Indirect ELISA results demonstrated that ‘CVNFNFNGL’ specifically
bond to serum IgG antibodies in the patient recovering from COVID-19, but not in healthy human (Fig. 3D).
These results suggest that the four linear B-cell epitopes (‘YNSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFT’,
‘GDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLP’,

‘YQPYRVVVLSFELLH’, and ‘CVNFNFNGL’) may be able to

induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Antibodies against the four linear B-cell epitopes neutralize SARS-CoV-2
To confirm that the four linear B-cell epitopes generated antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we immunized sixto eight-week-old female BALB/c mice through five consequent subcutaneous injections of five microgram
dose of linear B-cell epitope-based synthetic peptides with 7 days interval between two consecutive injections
(five mice per linear B-cell epitope). Serum samples collected from each synthetic peptide immunized mice
were assessed for binding to corresponding linear B-cell epitope by ELISA, as well as for neutralization
against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live virus. It was evident that a substantial percentage of antibodies
generated in vaccinated mice against the linear B-cell epitope antigens as demonstrated in the ELISA results
(Fig. 3E), suggesting that antibodies directed at the four linear B-cell epitopes could bind SARS-CoV-2.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV60, pseudovirus neutralization assay is a sensitive and quantitative method. We
therefore tested the concentration of neutralizing antibodies in immune sera from wild type mice 7 days after
the fifth vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus using a pseudotyped virus-based neutralization assay
developed recently for SARS-CoV-261. The neutralizing antibodies were detected in all mice immunized with
each of the four linear B-cell epitopes (mean EC50 is 1963 for ‘YNSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFT’;

using immune sera from vaccinated mice 7 days after the fifth vaccination. We found the strongest

‘YQPYRVVVLSFELLH’ also showed strong neutralization activity (mean NT50 = 47.4); we observed the
neutralization activities for ‘GDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLP’ (mean NT50 = 18.6) and ‘CVNFNFNGL’
(mean NT50 = 15.2) (Fig. 3G). Overall, these results demonstrated that the four linear B-cell epitopes can
induce neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

Conclusion
SARS-CoV-2 has caused a serious pandemic all over the world. Safe and effective vaccines are urgently
needed to be developed and deployed in a rapid but highly reliable manner. More than one hundred projects
are being executed in the WHO draft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines including a variety of
vaccine types such as viral vector-based vaccines, mRNA and DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines, nanoparticlebased vaccines, to inactivated-whole virus vaccines5-9. However, even for vaccines in clinical trial phase III,
some mild side effects are still observed and sporadically reported. Ongoing efforts are necessary for
developing new vaccines. Rigorous selection of epitopes most likely to elicit neutralizing antibodies against
virus can accelerate this process.
S protein is an important target in vaccine development for its critical functions for SARS-CoV-2 to fuse and
enter into the host cells15-17. A large number of predicted epitopes are generated within a highly accelerated
time frame20-43, but the selection of in-silicon prediction methods is based on the experiences and preferences
of each individual researcher. There is no comprehensive benchmark about the accuracy and specificity of
these epitopes prediction methods yet. Lack of limited number of target epitopes with supports from biological
validation experiments makes the epitope-based vaccine development in the middle of nowhere.
In this study, we predicted linear B-cell epitopes from S protein by eight widely-used immune-informatics
methods including Bepipred and Bepipred2.0 with default parameter settings, Kolaskar and Tongaonkar
antigenicity, Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fasman beta-turn, and Karplus and Schulz flexibility provided
by IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource)44, BcePred45 using accessibility, antigenic
propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, and turns, ANNpred-based server ABCpred46,
Ellipro47, BCPREDS48, AAP49, FBCPRED50 and COVIDep51. To generate a comprehensive linear B-cell
epitope candidate list, we incorporated 279 linear B-cell epitopes curated from 24 articles or preprints19-43
published between Feb 6, 2020 and July 10, 2020. Interestingly, the linear B-cell epitopes predicted by
different methods converged to some hotspot regions in the S protein, suggesting the pivotal role of these
regions in diagnostics assay and vaccine development. Integrating antigenicity, toxicity, stability and
physiochemical properties, 3D structure of S protein, the 3D conformation structure between RBD of S protein
and ACE2, we selected 18 top prioritized linear B-cell epitopes for further investigation. Four out of 18 linear

B-cell epitope-based synthetic peptides were found to specifically bind with serum antibodies from horse,
mouse, and monkey inoculated with different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates or a patient recovering from
COVID-19. The serum antibodies we used here were generated by different regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (S1-based vaccine for horse, RBD-based vaccines for mouse and monkey, unknown regions for a
patient recovering from COVID-19), leading to the observation that the four peptides didn’t consistently show
specific binding with all antibodies produced across horse, mouse, monkey and a patient recovering from
COVID-19. However, the four peptides were able to elicit neutralizing antibodies in immunized wild-type
BALB/c mice against both pseudo and live SARS-CoV-2 virus.
To the best of our knowledge, the linear B-cell epitope candidate list we presented is one of the most
comprehensive and valuable source for developing vaccines. Importantly, the four linear B-cell epitopes we
identified able to elicit neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are promising and valuable candidates
which have immediate usefulness for developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Besides, more linear B-cell
epitopes in the candidate list may also deserve being examined. The analysis workflow we adopted can be
broadly applied to identify B-cell epitopes for a large repertoire of virus, not limited to coronavirus. In short,
the results we presented here will be useful to guide the identification and prioritization of linear B-cell
epitope-based diagnostics and vaccine designs during this unprecedented pandemic.

Methods
Data retrieval and structural analysis
SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence (Accession number MN908947.3)62 was extracted from the NCBI database.
Experimentally solved 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB)11 was retrieved from Protein
Data Bank. The predicted 3D structure of protein interactions between SARS-CoV-2 S protein RBD domain
and human ACE-2 was obtained from recent reports54-57,63,64. The transmembrane topology of S protein was
examined by TMHMM.v2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). VaxiJen v2.052 was used to estimate
the antigenicity of full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

Linear B-cell epitope prediction for SARS-CoV-2 S protein

exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity, and turns. The ANNpred-based server ABCpred46,
Ellipro47, BCPREDS48, AAP49, FBCPRED50, and COVIDep51 were also employed to predict linear B-cell
epitopes. 25 published articles or preprints19-43 about epitope predictions from Feb 6, 2020 to July 10, 2020
were curated to obtain a total of 214 B-cell epitopes. All the linear B-cell epitopes including those predicted by
the eight methods and those curated from literature were combined to the linear B-cell epitope candidate list.
According to the transmembrane topology of SARS-CoV-2 S protein predicted by TMHMM v2.0, the linear
B-cell epitopes on the outer surface were retained for downstream analysis with intracellular epitopes
eliminated. The linear B-cell epitopes consisting of less than six amino acids or more than 50 amino acids were
further removed. The antigenicity of the remained linear B-cell epitopes was evaluated by VaxiJen 2.052. A
stringent criterion was employed to have linear B-cell epitopes with an antigenicity score larger than 0.9
viewed adequate to initiate a defensive immune reaction.

Characterization of the 18 selected linear B-cell epitopes
The target profiles of IgG or IgA antibodies from 232 COVID-19 patient sera (101 for hospitalized, 131 for
non-hospitalized) and 190 pre-COVID-19 era controls were generated in duplicates by a recent research53,
using coronavirus 20-mer libraries which included 20-mer peptides tiling every 5 amino acids across the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome. The target profiles for IgG/IgA IPs using coronavirus 20-mer libraries were in the
form of Z-score, directly obtained from the literature53. The Z-scores of the 20-mer peptides in the target
profiles were first averaged for the two duplicates of each sample. For each of the 18 linear B-cell epitopes, the
Z-scores of 20-mer peptides with more than 75% overlapping with the linear B-cell epitope were compared
between hospitalized, non-hospitalized COVID-19 patient groups and negative controls using Mann Whitney
U test. The significance was determined if the p value was less than or equal to 0.05.
The locations of the selected linear B-cell epitopes on the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein or the
interacting conformation of S protein RBD and human ACE254-56 were examined through open-source Pymol.
The chemicals and physical properties (Grand average of hydropathicity, half-life, molecular weight, stability
index and amino acid atomic composition) of the selected linear B-cell epitopes were analyzed through
Protparam65. ToxinPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/index.html) was employed to evaluate the
toxicity of linear B-cell epitopes along with hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity, and charge. As the
stable peptidesdigested by fewer enzymes are more favorable candidate vaccines66, the digestion of all the
selected B-cell epitopes by 13 enzymes (Trypsin, Chymotrpsin, Clostripain, Cyanogen Bromide,
IodosoBenzoate, Proline Endopept, Staph Protease, Trypsin K, Trypsin R, AspN, Chymotrypsin (modified),

Conservation analysis of selected B-cell epitopes
The conservation status for each residue of SARS-CoV-2 were investigated by ConSurf67 using the amino acid
sequences of S protein from seven known coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 (YP_009724390.1), SARSCoV (NP_828851.1), MERS-CoV (YP_009047204.1), alpha coronavirus 229E (NP_073551.1), alpha
coronavirus NL63 (AFV53148.1), beta coronavirus OC43 (YP_009555241.1) and beta coronavirus HKU1
(AAT98580.1). The S protein sequences of different SARS-CoV-2 virus strains were extracted from an openaccess database NGDC (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/), where 118,694 SARS-CoV-2 virus strains’ sequences
were documented with 53,969 mutations reported in the virus genome until September27, 2020.

Peptide Synthesis
The selected 18 linear B-cell epitopes were synthesized by Scilight-Peptide Inc., Beijing, China via a practical
approach of Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. The unsophisticated peptides were purified using a Varian
ProStar 218 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument with an Agilent Venusil MP C18
reversed phase column. Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of water, H2O, and acetonitrile, CAN,
(both having 0.05% TFA) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The separation was monitored at 220 nm using UV
detection. Then peptides were subjected to Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. The solvents
for gradient elution HPLC are: solvent A, CAN 2%, TFA 0.05% and solvent B, CAN 90%, TFA 0.05%.
Peptides were dissolved in deionized H2O at a final concentration of 20mg/ml and stored at -20oC until further
use.

Cell lines and viruses
Vero cells (ATCC,CCL-81) and 293T cells (ATCC,CRL-11268) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, USA), penicillin
(Hyclone, USA, 100 units/mL) and streptomycin (Hyclone, USA, 100 µg/mL) (complete medium) in 5% CO2
environment at 37 °C and passaged every 2-3 days. BetaCoV/Beijing/IMEBJ01/2020 strain (Genome
Warehouse Accession No. GWHACAX01000000) was isolated from a COVID-19 patient and propagated in
Vero cells. Virus titres were determined on Vero cells, and virus stocks were stored in aliquots at −80 °C until
use(100 CCID50/0.05ml). SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were provided by Dr. Weijin Huang at Institute for
Biological Product Control, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) of China68.

The experiments with infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed at the biosafety level 3 facilities in Beijing
Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Sciences, China.

Animal experiments
All animal experiments were approved by and carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional
Experimental Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee. Specific pathogen-free female BALB/c mice aged 6–8
weeks were obtained from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technologies Co., Ltd (Beijing, China) and
were housed and bred in the temperature-, humidity and light cycle-controlled animal facility (20 ± 2 °C; 50 ±
10%; light, 7:00–19:00; dark,19:00–7:00). The rhesus monkeys (2.0±0.5 kg, 1.5–2.5 years) were provided by
Laboratory Animal Center, Academy of Military Medical Science. The animals were housed under standard
laboratory conditions. The 4-6 year old, healthy brown horses (300-350kg in weight) that had no detectable
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, were provided by Chifeng Boen Pharmacy Co., LTD (InnerMongolia, China)

The Balb/C mice and monkeys were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized with the RBD-IgG1 Fc subunit vaccine
candidate (10µg per mouse, 40µg per monkey), or Al(OH)3 adjuvant as a control. After the primary injection,
all animals received two booster injections with 14 days intervals. The horses were inoculated subcutaneously
with SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (S1 Subunit, His tag) (Sino Biological, China, cat no:40591-V08H) antigens
containing 1.0mg, 1.5mg, 2.0mg and 3.0mg on day 0, 14, 28 and 42, respectively, or Freund′s adjuvant as a
control. For each inoculation, 5ml of antigen suspension was mixed with an equal volume of Freund′s adjuvant
according to the directions and injected into the several sites near the submandibular and inguinal lumph nodes.
Blood samples were collected and used for ELISA and neutralization assays.

SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG assay in horse, mouse, monkey and human (Indirect ELISA)
96-well polystyrene microplates (Oriental Ocean Global Health, China) were coated with 2 µg/mL (50µL/well)
SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein (S1 Subunit, His tag) (Sino Biological, China, cat no:40591-V08H) in carbonate
bicarbonate buffer pH9.6 and the plates were incubated at 4oC overnight. The plates were then blocked at
37 °C for one hour with PBS (Solarbio, China, cat no:A8020) pH 7.4 in 5% skim milk (blocking buffer) and
washed with PBST(0.1% Tween-80) three times. Serial dilutions of sera in dilution buffer (Solarbio, China, cat
no: P1010) were added to the plates and incubatedat 37oC for 30 minutes. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (Southern Biotech, cat no:1030-05, 1:5000 dilution), HRP-conjuated goat anti-horse IgG (Bellancom
life H15034,1:2000 dilution) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-monkey IgG (Solarbio, China, cat no: SE241,
1:3000 dilution for monkey, 1:2000 dilution for human) was added to the plates, and the plates were incubated

in incubator (ZHCHENG, China, ZXDP-B2050) at 37oC for 30 minutes and washed with PBST three times.
The assay was developed for 10min at 37oC with 50 µL of TMB substrate solution (Solarbio,China, cat no: PR1200),
stopped by the addition of 50 µL of stop solution (Solarbio, China, cat no:C1058), and then the optical density (OD)
was measured at 450 nm (TECAN, INFINITE F50). The endpoint titre was defined as the highest reciprocal serum
dilution that yielded anabsorbance ≥2.1-fold over negative control serum values (OD value is set as 0.05, if it is less
than 0.05).The indirect ELISA were performed at the biosafety level 2 facilities in Beijing Institute of

Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China.

Vaccination of mice
Linear B-cell epitopes (‘YNSASFSTFKCYGVSPTKLNDLCFT’, ‘GDEVRQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLP’,
‘YQPYRVVVLSFELLH’, and ‘CVNFNFNGL’) were respectively used to immunize BALB/c mice (n = 5 per
linear B-cell epitope) through five consequent subcutaneous injections of five microgram dose with 7 days
interval between two consecutive injections. Sera were collected for SARS-CoV-2 live virus neutralization
assay titration (NT50) and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay titration (EC50) at different time
point.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay
A pseudotyped virus-based neutralization assay against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities was
performed as previously described61. Briefly, serial dilutions of the samples to be tested were mixed with 3251,300 TCID50/ml of pseudotyped virus. The target cells were incubated for 24 hours, and then the neutralizing
antibody content of the sample was obtained by calculating the amount of pseudotyped virus entering the
target cells which were detected by the expression of luciferase. The half maximal effective concentration
(EC50) was calculated for the tested samples using the Reed-Muench method in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad
software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The assays were performed at the biosafety level 2 facilities in Beijing
Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay
Microneutralization (MN) assay was performed to assess the neutralizing activity of sera from the mice. 50µl
(100 CCID50/0.05ml) of SARS-CoV-2 IME-BJ01 strain was incubated with serial dilution of heat-inactivated
sera in 5% CO2 environment at 37oC for one hour. The complexes of antibody-virus (100TCID50/50µl) were
added to pre-plated Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated for 72 hours. The Reed-Muench
