The influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is known for its ability to hinder the

Introduction

49

The type I interferon (IFN) response resulting from invading viral pathogens is

50

considered as one of the first lines of antiviral defence mechanisms in higher

51

organisms. The latter process takes place upon the detection of the pathogen

52

associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) by the host pattern recognition receptors

53

(PRRs). Secretion of interferons takes place in both paracrine and autocrine

54

signalling mechanisms, mediated by the canonical JAK/STAT signal transduction

55

pathway along with the transcriptional activation of a particular set of host genes as

56

well as their corresponding promotors defined as IFN-stimulated response elements

57

(ISREs)1. Subsequent activation of the downstream interferon stimulated genes

58

(ISGs) lead to the transcriptional induction of a plethora of antiviral proteins,

59

including dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) leading to a halt of protein

60

translation, dsRNA-activated oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS) which facilitate the

61

degradation of RNA by activating RNAse L and Mx proteins which essentially

62

sequester incoming viral components such as nucleocapsids2, 3. Many studies have

63

demonstrated that viruses have evolved to encode numerous mechanisms to

64

prevent the host IFN-mediated antiviral response at different stages4. Viral non-

65

structural proteins such as those of Toscana virus, dengue and HPV can sequester

66

host factors to inhibit type I IFN response5,6,7, while viruses such as vaccinia, adeno

67

and Ebola viruses secrete soluble ligands7,8, or encode miRNAs9,

68

proteins to confer immune-evasion.

69

The influenza A virus (IAV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) facilitates several functions

70

ranging from inhibition of host mRNA polyadenylation and subsequent inhibition of

71

their nuclear export as well as inhibition of pre-mRNA splicing11, 12. A growing body of

72

evidence to date has indicated that influenza NS1 protein has IFN antagonistic

73

activity. It was initially shown that a recombinant influenza A virus that lacks the NS1

74

protein(ΔNS1) grew to a titer similar to that of WT virus in IFN deficient systems,

75

albeit being markedly attenuated in IFN competent hosts13. This attenuated

76

phenotype can be explained by the inability of the virus to prevent NS1 mediated IFN

77

inhibition. The NS1 protein has been shown to bind to TRIM25 whereby the

78

ubiquitination of the viral RNA sensor RIG-I is inhibited, which eventually results in

79

the inhibition of IFN induction14,15. NS1 has also been shown to prevent IFN

80

production by sequestering the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation specificity

81

factor 30 (CPSF30) in order to halt the processing of host pre-mRNAs, resulting in

82

accumulation of pre-mRNAs in the nucleus as well as the halt of cellular mRNA

83

export to the cytoplasm16. This subsequently results in the inhibition of host protein

84

production, including IFNs and proteins encoded by IFN inducible genes

85

has also been shown to inhibit the antiviral activity of several IFN-stimulated genes,

86

such as the 2’-5’- oligo A synthase (OAS)19.

87

Consistent with its function, deletion of NS1 in recombinant IAV results in a live

88

attenuated and highly immunogenic IAV. As a result, IAV with impaired NS1 function

89

are currently used as vaccines against swine influenza in pigs20 and they are under

90

clinical consideration as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines21-23.

91

Based on the growing body of evidence showing the IFN antagonistic properties of

92

IAV NS1, we investigated the ability of the ΔNS1 viruses to induce an immediate IFN

93

response in vivo along with the biological antiviral consequences mediated by the

94

type I IFN induction. Our results demonstrate that the

103

Previously, we demonstrated that tissue culture-based infections by

104

induced the transactivation of an ISRE-containing reporter gene13, indicating that

105

infection by ΔNS1 viruses induces higher levels of IFN in comparison to its wild type

Subsequently, the allantoic fluids were harvested 18 hours post treatment to

109

measure the levels of IFN by determining the highest dilution that inhibited the

110

cytopathic effect mediated by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in chicken embryo

111

fibroblast (CEF) cells. As indicated in the Supplementary table 1, four hundred Uml-1

112

of IFN were detected in the allantoic fluid of eggs infected by ΔNS1 virus. However,

113

allantoic fluids derived from WT-PR8 or mock infections indicated undetectable

levels of IFN (<16 Uml-1).

We speculated that the ability of the

evaluate this, increasing amounts of ΔNS1 virus were inoculated into eggs and eight

124

virus to an approximate titer of 108 PFUml-1, administration of a dose as little as

125

2x104 PFUml-1 of

126

PFUml-1 of WSN were obtained in eggs). The titer of WSN virus was reduced by one

127

log, by pre-treating allantoic fluids with as little as 2 PFU of ΔNS1 (Figure 1A).

Interestingly, treatment using

with 2x104 PFUml-1 of

Influenza A H1N1 strains WSN and PR8, H3N2 strain X-31, influenza B virus or

132

Sendai virus (SeV; a paramyxovirus). In all cases, pre-treatment with ΔNS1 resulted

133

in a two-log reduction of wild-type viral HA titers.

134

Severe disease and death caused by infection with the highly virulent PR8

135

virus (hvPR8) in A2G mice can be alleviated by ΔNS1 pre-treatment.

136

In order to assess whether or not the administration of ΔNS1 virus inhibits replication

137

of influenza viruses in mice, an inbred mouse strain that is homozygous for the gene

138

which codes for the IFN induced full-length Mx1 protein, defined as C57BL/6-A2G

139

(abbreviated as A2G) mice were used for this part of the study24, 25. Previous studies

140

have concluded that IFN administration was ineffective in preventing IAV replication

141

in laboratory mice lacking a functional Mx1 gene26. In contrast, A2G mice which were

142

administered IFN remained alive upon infection with the highly virulent hvPR8 IAV

143

strain27. The presence of a functional Mx1 gene in A2G mice better mirrors the

144

human situation, as Mx1 gene deficiencies in humans are rare. Here, A2G mice

were intranasally infected with a dose of 5x105 PFUml-1 of ΔNS1 virus or PBS at -24,

PFU of hvPR8 virus. Mice treated with ΔNS1 virus were protected from hvPR8 virus

148

as measured by weight loss and death while the PBS treated mice succumbed to

149

death (Figure 2A).

150

Subsequently, we examined whether all five ΔNS1 treatments were essential for the

151

protective effect against hvPR8 infection in mice. Hence, a single dose of 5x106 PFU

Data indicated (Figure 2B) that pre-treatment (hours 24 or 8 before hvPR8

resulted in the prevention of weight loss disease and subsequent death. Additionally,

156

ΔNS1

157

protected mice from disease (Figure 2C).

158

Next, to obtain the effective dose 50 (ED50) of

159

against disease from hvPR8 infection, 2x105, 2x104, 2x103or 2x102 doses of

160

virus were intranasally administered to A2G mice 24 hours prior to hvPR8 challenge.

As shown in Figure 2D, the ED50 of the

A2G mice against hvPR8-induced death was approximately 103 PFU.

an RT-PCR assay for Mx1 specific mRNA in infected animal lungs infected was

developed. In parallel, infections were performed in BALB/c mice which have a non-

171

no specific mRNA was detected in mock infected mRNA.

172

ΔNS1 mediated protection from hvPR8 is Mx1-mediated.

173

As the Mx1 protein is one of the most potent IFN inducible gene products with anti-

174

influenza virus activity in mice, it is quite possible that the ΔNS1-mediated protection

175

seen in A2G mice is Mx1-mediated. To test this hypothesis, we compared the

176

antiviral activity of ΔNS1 in A2G mice and in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice harbour

177

a non-functional Mx1 gene due to a known deletion26 and were used as a back-cross

178

genetic platform for the original A2G strain to generate the Mx1 positive A2G mice

179

used in our experiments. A dose of PR8-ΔNS1 containing 5x106 PFU given 12H

180

before a lethal hvPR8 challenge protected all A2G-Mx1 mice (n=5) in both morbidity

181

and mortality in comparison to the PBS pre-treated group (n=5). However, all five

182

MX1-deficient mice in the wild-type C57BL/6 group that were given the same dose of

183

PR8-ΔNS1 succumbed to death by a lethal hvPR8 challenge. The morbidity data for

184

these mice based on body weight was also consistent with lack of protection after

cells (Supplementary table.2). A reduction of hvPR8 titers in lungs by fourfold was

195

observed when mice were pre-treated with

196

infected with ΔNS1 virus had titers below the detection limit (<10 PFUml-1), while not

197

showing any significant reduction of bodyweight. It was apparent that infection by

198

hvPR8 virus without ΔNS1 administration resulted in the increase of lung weight by a

199

factor of two or three in comparison to mice that were pre-treated with ΔNS1 virus. In

200

the context of this study, increased lung weights are suggestive of lymphocytic

201

infiltration and pulmonary disease during Influenza virus infection28, 29.

202

Attenuated influenza viruses via a mutation in the Neuraminidase (NA) gene

203

does not confer ΔNS1-like antiviral properties.

204

Antiviral properties observed thus far in this study is from an attenuated influenza

205

virus lacking the NS1 gene (ΔNS1). To confirm that the protective effects observed

206

here are not due to the attenuation caused by the lack of a gene but specifically due

207

to the lack of NS1, the antiviral property of ΔNS1 virus was compared to that of a the

208

recombinant D2 influenza virus. The D2 virus contains a base-pair mutation in the

209

dsRNA region formed by the non-coding sequences of its NA gene. This mutation is

210

responsible for a 10-fold reduction in the NA protein levels as well as a one-log

211

reduction in viral titers within a multicycle growth curve30. The latter D2 strain has

212

also been shown to be highly attenuated in mice with a LD50 of more than 106 PFU

213

upon intranasal administration31. Identical doses (2.5x105 PFU) of D2 or

214

viruses were intranasally administered to A2G mice four hours prior to challenge with

215

5x106 PFU of hvPR8. Although a prolonged survival was seen in one of the animals

who received D2, pre-treatment with D2 was ineffective in protecting A2G mice from

ΔNS1 viral treatment prevents death by Sendai virus (SeV) in C57BL/6 mice

219

Given the fact, that the antiviral effects against hvPR8 mediated by

220

facilitated by an IFN mediated mechanism (Mx1 gene induction), we speculated that

221

ΔNS1 treatment should protect mice from infections by other IFN sensitive viruses.

222

Sendai virus was used in this study due to its pneumotropic nature and sensitivity to

223

IFN in Mx1 deficient mice32, 33. As seen in Figure 1B, treatment with

224

Sendai viral replication in embryonated chicken eggs. Moreover, upon two intranasal

225

administrations of 2.5x105 PFU of ΔNS1 virus to C57BL/6 mice at times -24 and +24

226

hours or -8 and +72 hours, mice infected with 5x105 PFU of Sendai virus were

227

protected from death (Figure 5A). The C57BL/6 mice used here are Mx1-/- and it is

228

indicative that the mouse nuclear Mx1 protein does not have any antiviral activities

229

against cytoplasmic viruses such as Sendai virus34. The efficacy of

230

was compared against three doses of IFN-β using the Sendai virus challenge model.

Treatment with the highest dose of IFN-β (2x105 U) protected mice from death

245

on day 8 and 9 while the uIFN group lost one animal out of 5 at a later time point

Discussion

251

The NS1 protein of the influenza A virus has been shown to possess IFN antagonist

252

activity whereby it is able to dampen the host innate immune response to provide a

253

favourable environment for the virus to replicate. It has been demonstrated to be

254

highly expressed in the host cytoplasm and nucleus upon viral infection, interacting

255

with a plethora of host factors to inhibit the interferon response35. Data show the

256

ability of NS1 to compete with innate immune sensors such as RLR to bind to

257

dsRNA to avoid innate immune detection36. Additionally, NS1 has been shown to

258

interact with other innate immune signalling components such as PKR37, TRIM2538

259

and CPSF16, resulting in lowering of the IFN mediated innate immunity39. For these

260

reasons, influenza viruses with impaired NS1 function (and an increased innate

261

immune response) have been under consideration for live attenuated influenza

262

vaccines. There is an existing swine influenza vaccine based on NS1-deficient live

263

attenuated viruses40, and clinical trials in humans using an intranasally administered

264

administration of the ΔNS1 virus induced an antiviral state, which prevented disease

and death by a highly pathogenic influenza A virus (hvPR8) which is otherwise

evidence has indicated that the protective impact of IFN against IAV infection in mice

is mainly mediated by the IFN inducible antiviral Mx1 gene44-46. Consistently, we

279

found that Mx1 was required for the ΔNS1 mediated protection against lethal hvPR8

to four days before the challenge with hvPR8 virus was effective in preventing

284

disease. The Mx1 protein in mice is known to be stable for several days upon its

285

induction and our observations are consistent with the half-life of the Mx1 protein

286

described in mice47, 48.

that protection is not just mediated by any attenuated IAV (Figure.4).

292

mice were also protected from lethal infection with an influenza-unrelated

293

pneumotropic Sendai virus, suggesting that the IFN-mediated innate immune

294

response induced by ΔNS1 has broad-antiviral effects, rather than being a pathogen-

295

specific immune response. As anticipated for Sendai virus, the abovementioned

296

protection was not Mx1 mediated and is most likely due to the activation of other

297

ISGs such as OAS or PKR upon the ΔNS1-mediated IFN production49.

298

The feasibility of ΔNS1 virus as a prophylactic treatment to induce a type I interferon

299

response to prevent acute respiratory infections from IFN sensitive viruses was

300

demonstrated in the current study. Type I interferon administration has been used to

301

treat a range of human diseases ranging from infections such as hepatitis B and C50,

302

51

303

leukaemia53. Although IFN has been promoted as a therapeutic agent, administration

304

of exogenous interferon comes with a set of undesirable side effects54,

305

due to its causing major endocrine and metabolic changes in the host56. Therefore,

306

various groups have attempted alternative ways to induce local type I IFN responses

307

using different strategies. Some of these strategies were topical administration of

308

plasmid DNA coding for IFNα1 in the mouse eye to protect against HSV-1

309

encephalitis57, liposomic intranasal treatment using dsRNA to induce IFN58 as well

310

as recombinant viral vectors such as adenoviruses59 and hepatitis B viruses to

311

express type I IFN to protect against infection and tumor regression59. Despite these

312

experimental attempts to study the efficacy of IFN, it is still unclear whether virally

313

induced IFN is more or less toxic efficient that IFN itself. This indicates that further

314

work is needed to be done to ascertain the suitability of recombinant viruses as IFN

315

inducers for therapeutic purposes. The physiological half-lives and binding affinities

317

minutes to several hours, depending on the type of IFN60. Our data showed antiviral

properties of

320

variable due to their differential effects contributed by the ISGs, most therapeutic

321

properties of type I interferons are yet to be completely understood61,

322

instance, comparable prophylactic responses were obtained by the administration of

323

either 2x105 U of IFN-β or 2x105 PFU of

324

acknowledged that different subsets of IFN-regulated genes may differ in their

325

relative transcriptional induction between treatments.

326

We also demonstrated that prophylactic treatment using

327

viral replication in a relevant mouse model that can be infected with WT SARS-CoV-

328

2 and is known to result in lethal infection63(Figure 6). This agrees with reports that

329

state that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN64. Interestingly, a similar level of reduction

330

in viral titers was not seen upon intranasal inoculation of universal-IFN nor defective

331

interfering RNA derived from SeV (SDE-RNA; a RIG-I agonist with known

332

adjuvanting properties)65. While these treatments resulted in a better outcome in

333

comparison to PBS pre-treatment, high amounts of viral titers were still observed day

334

three and five post infection. Although weight loss and survival were best in the

335

ΔNS1 group, the uIFN treated group showed a protective phenotype indicating that

336

uIFN treatment was better than that provided by SDI-RNA. The difference observed

337

here is likely due to the stimulation of multiple innate immune mechanisms by ΔNS1

338

which potentially primes cells to confer a broad antiviral phenotype. However,

339

analysis of differentially expressed genes (particularly ISGs) via a technique such as

340

bulk RNAseq would provide more insights in explaining the observed protective

342

In conclusion, we report that prophylactic treatment with an attenuated influenza A

343

virus lacking the NS1 gene induces an innate antiviral response which provides

344

protection against IFN-sensitive viruses in both embryonated chicken eggs and mice.

345

These in vivo data further validate previous observations showing the IFN-

346

antagonistic properties of the NS1 protein of influenza A viruses13,

347

highlighting the role of NS1 in inhibiting IFN induction during influenza A virus

infections. We also provide evidence for its therapeutic potential as a prophylactic to

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or Vero

368

cells were plated to obtain confluent monolayers and plaque assays were performed

369

as previously described and an agar overlay in DMEM-F12 including 1 µgml-1 of

370

trypsin was used. MDCK, cVero and BHK cells were cultured in DMEM in the

371

presence of 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin. The chicken embryo fibroblasts

372

(CEF) purchased from ATCC was maintained in MEM as suggested by ATCC. Vero-

373

Measurement of Interferon

393

Ten day old embryonated eggs were infected with 103 PFU in100 µl containing either

394

ΔNS1, PR8 viruses or PBS as mock. Next, the eggs were incubated at 37°C and the

395

allantoic fluids were extracted 18 hours post infection. Viral inactivation of the

396

allantoic fluids were conducted by dialysis against 0.1 M KCL-HCL buffer at pH 2 for

397

two days at 4°C. Later, the pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 7 by subsequent

398

dialysis against Hank’s balanced sodium salt solution with 20 mM NA3PO4 for two

399

more days as described previously71. The amount of IFN was titrated according to its

400

ability to inhibit the growth of VSV72. In summary, CEF cells in 96wells were treated

401

with 100 µl of different dilutions of the respective samples in tissue culture media.

402

Upon incubating for an hour at 37°C, 200 TCID50 of VSV in 10 µl were added to the

403

wells before incubating at 37°C until complete lysis of untreated control cells was

404

observed (approximately two days). As a standard control, recombinant chicken IFN

405

donated by Drs. Peter Staeheli and Bernd Kaspers was used73.

Detection of MX1 Specific mRNA in infected cells

418

A2G and BALB/c mice were intranasally challenged with 105 PFU of either ΔNS1 or

419

hvPR8 or PBS. Afterwards, lungs were extracted 24 hours post infection, snap

420

frozen, homogenized, total RNA was extracted using TRIreagent (Sigma-Alderich).

421

One microgram of total lung RNA was used to perform a RT reaction in a total

422

volume of 20 µl using Mx1 specific primer. Two µl of the resulting RT product was

423

used for PCR amplification using Mx1 specific primers under the following conditions

424

(20 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at 55°C, 30 seconds at 72°C for a total of 25

425

cycles). The sense and antisense primer sequences are as follows; 5’-

bp while it was 333 bp in BALB/c mice due to a deletion in the Mx1 gene between

430

nucleotides 1120-154331.
