Abstract
The molecular events that permit the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to bind, fuse, and enter cells are important to understand for both
fundamental and therapeutic reasons. Spike proteins consist of S1 and S2 domains, which
recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and contain the viral fusion
machinery, respectively. Ostensibly, the binding of spike trimers to ACE2 receptors promotes the
preparation of the fusion machinery by dissociation of the S1 domains. We report the
development and use of coarse-grained models and simulations to investigate the dynamical
mechanisms involved in viral binding and exposure of the S2 trimeric core. We show that spike
trimers cooperatively bind to multiple ACE2 dimers. The multivalent interaction cyclically and
processively induces S1 dissociation, thereby exposing the S2 core containing the fusion
machinery. Our simulations thus reveal an important concerted interaction between spike
trimers and ACE2 dimers that primes the virus for membrane fusion and entry.

Significance Statement
Viral particles of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, are decorated by spike trimer proteins that mediate entry into
cells. Spike trimers first bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, and
subsequently shed their receptor-binding components to expose and prepare the viral fusion
machinery. Here, we present systematically developed coarse-grained models and molecular
dynamics simulations of viral binding and shedding prior to membrane fusion. Our analysis shows
that spike trimers are capable of binding to multiple ACE2 dimers and that this multivalent
interaction facilitates exposure of the viral fusion core machinery. Our findings demonstrate the
necessity of concerted, cooperative interactions between viral proteins and host cell receptors,
and advance fundamental understanding and therapeutic efforts on coronaviruses, aspects of
which are at present difficult if not impossible to obtain by experimental means alone.

Introduction
Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) begins with
binding of viral particles to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell-surface receptors,
followed by viral-host cell membrane fusion, and entry of the viral genetic cargo (1). These events
are orchestrated by spike glycoproteins – trimeric class I fusion proteins – that decorate the
exterior of SARS-CoV-2 particles. Each spike protein consists of S1 and S2 domains, which are
post-translationally cleaved by furin and remain non-covalently associated in a metastable
prefusion state (2, 3). The S1 domain contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) that is
responsible for ACE2 recognition, while the S2 domain contains the fusion machinery. The S2
domains interact as a trimeric core with a characteristic helical stalk that is partially covered by
the three S1 domains; the RBDs interact as a trimeric cap around the S2 trimeric core (4, 5). A
hinge-like conformational change exposes the RBD interfaces that are amenable to ACE2
association. Receptor binding is believed to result in S1 shedding, thereby exposing the S2 core.
For fusion to occur, the second proteolytic site S2’ is cleaved, thereby releasing the fusion
peptide, after which the S2 core undergoes a dramatic conformational change into an extended
helical stalk, i.e., the postfusion state, in a process similar to prior coronaviruses (6).
As spike proteins are indispensable to SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, inhibiting their function is a
natural target for therapeutic design. Understanding how spike proteins bind to ACE2 and how
binding primes exposure of the S2 trimeric core is therefore essential to viral activity. Structures
resolved using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) combined with docking have shown that
ACE2-RBD binding requires spike trimers to be open, and that two spike trimers can be
accommodated on one ACE2 dimer (7). Additional cryo-EM structures have shown that up to
three soluble ACE2 monomers can bind to the same spike trimer, which may result in exposure
of the S2 trimeric core (8); indeed, soluble ACE2 trimers were recently demonstrated as an
effective inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 (9). Both modalities are potentially important for viral avidity,
and furthermore, likely dependent upon the flexibility exhibited by both the spike trimer stalk
(10) and ACE2 domain (11), as well as the stochastic nature of RBD opening observed throughout
the spike trimer (4, 5). It has also been suggested that ACE2 binding to spike trimers induces
allosteric effects that heighten (dampen) conformational motions near proteolytic cleavage sites

and the fusion peptide (near the central helix and stalk) (12) or conformational motions that
promote subsequent RBD opening (13). Characterization of three circulating variant strains
(B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1) has shown that increased infectivity is, in part, due to mutations in the
RBD that increase ACE2 binding affinity (14, 15). Clearly, viral binding, fusion, and entry rely on a
complex dynamical process that likely leverages the concerted interactions between spike
trimers and ACE2 receptors.
To elucidate the molecular events that lead to binding and priming of the spike protein
for membrane fusion, we use here molecular dynamics simulations. We first use atomistic
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to systematically derive from “bottom-up” effective
coarse-grained (CG) models of spike trimers and ACE2 dimers, which are then validated against
conformational state statistics extracted from experimental cryo-EM data. We then use CG MD
simulations to investigate the binding between spike trimers and ACE2 receptors, and associated
shedding of the S1 domains that expose the S2 trimeric cores. Our simulations indicate that spike
trimers cooperatively bind to multiple ACE2 dimers, and show that this multivalent interaction is
necessary to productively prime the virus for membrane fusion. At present, such insights are
difficult to obtain experimentally.

Results
Our CG MD simulations consist of three constituents, spike trimers, ACE2 dimers, and lipid
membranes, each depicted in Fig. 1A. We extended our previously reported implicit-solvent, CG
spike protein model derived from all-atom molecular dynamics trajectories (16), which were
based on the open and closed state atomic models from cryo-EM (Protein Data Bank, PDB: 6VYB,
6VXX) (3). Each spike protomer is modeled as non-covalently interacting S1 and S2 domains with
a CG resolution of around 10-15 amino acids per CG “bead” or site, and initially prepared as
trimers. Briefly, intra-domain interactions are represented by a heterogeneous effective
harmonic bond network while inter-domain interactions are represented by a combination of
excluded volume repulsion, short-range attraction, and screened electrostatic terms (see
Methods). A similar resolution and interaction model are used to represent each ACE2 monomer,
initially prepared as dimers. The lipids are represented by a phenomenological CG model with a

bending rigidity of 30 kBT to emulate the mechanical properties of typical membranes (17). All
CG model details and parametrization procedures are described in the Methods and
Supplementary Information (SI) sections.
It is well-known that the RBDs of spike trimers are capable of hinge-like movements,
resulting in combinations of open and closed configurational states throughout the trimer (2-5).
Therefore, to validate our updated CG spike model, we quantified the configurational sampling
of the RBD. We first simulated a single CG spike trimer in membrane (see Methods) for 50106
CG timesteps (CG = 50 fs). To characterize the motions of the RBD, we quantified the distribution
of reciprocal interatomic distances (18) (DRID) for each configuration of the three RBDs; the DRID
method computes the first, second, and third moments of the reciprocal distances between each
CG site and every other CG site, yielding 3NCG features. We next performed dimensional
reduction using time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA), a linear projection
technique that aims to maximize representation of auto-correlations (19). The first 10 tIC
dimensions were clustered using k-means clustering (20), revealing three primary conformational
states. These three states can be seen in Fig. 1B, which depicts the probability distribution of
each of the three labeled clusters along the first tIC (tIC1) dimension. Assessing the root-meansquared deviation of the configurations from each of the three states (see Fig. 1D and Fig. S2)
reveals that the green-labeled distribution represents “closed” RBDs, the red-labeled distribution
represents “open” RBDs, and the blue-labeled distribution represents an intermediate state we
denote as “partially closed,” which we discuss later. The separability of the open- and closedstate distributions (we include the partially-closed state in the latter) depicted in Fig. 1B suggests
that tIC1 can be used as a classifying metric for the open state (tIC1 > 0.4) and closed or partiallyclosed states (tIC1 < 0.4).

dataset. (D) Representative depiction of the average configuration of CG S1 (brown beads) within the

In our prior cryo-ET classification of RBDs within spike trimers along the surface of intact
virions, we found that RBD conformations are stochastic and may range from three closed RBDs
to three open RBDs, with three closed RBDs and one open (two closed) RBDs representing the
two most predominant states (5). Given these observations, we assessed the distribution of open

RBDs within spike trimers as predicted by our CG model. We prepared 25 spike trimers in a flat
membrane (around 170170 nm2) with periodic boundary conditions and simulated three
replicas of the system for 172106 CG. The simulated surface density, which is around 1150 nm2
per spike trimer, was chosen to reflect virions observed using cryo-ET, which had 24  9 spike
trimers and an average diameter of 91 nm (5). Using the final 12.5106 CG, we characterized the
RBDs throughout each of the trimers and computed the population of trimers with 0, 1, 2, and 3
open RBDs. In Fig. 1C, we compare the distribution of trimer states from our CG simulations to
that of a previously reported cryo-ET dataset (5). Our CG spike trimers undergo a slow yet
reversible transition between open and closed states, with around 50% of the total population
having 1 open RBD, around 40% having 0 open RBDs (i.e., 3 closed), and diminishing populations
of 2 and 3 open RBD trimers. The relative populations of these states are consistent with the
cryo-ET classification of RBDs in virions. Note that complete S2 trimeric core exposure (i.e., the
precursor to the postfusion state) was not observed throughout these simulations. However, we
observed partial exposure in rare cases, i.e., single S1 domains from spike trimers spontaneously
dissociated due to thermal fluctuations, which we discuss further later. In contrast, a minority
population of postfusion trimers was observed by cryo-ET. At this point, it is unclear whether this
discrepancy is due to limitations of the CG model, due to fixation by formaldehyde which may
shift the open/closed equilibrium, or both. Nonetheless, our analysis provides qualitative
validation that the conformational variability of the RBD in our CG spike trimer is consistent with
experimental observations.
Next, to investigate the spike-ACE2 binding process, we simulated spike trimers
interfacing with ACE2 dimers. We prepared triplicate simulations of spike trimers in one
membrane adjacent to another containing ACE2 dimers (see Fig. 1A). The density of spike trimers
and ACE2 dimers was fixed such that the relative ratio of ACE2 dimer to spike trimer
([ACE2dimer]/[Strimer]) was 2.56, i.e., 64 ACE2 dimers and 25 spike trimers, sufficient to allow
multivalent ACE2 binding to each spike trimer. The two membranes (and their constituents) were
initially shifted along their normal directions until the closest distance between spike trimers and
ACE2 dimers was around 2 nm. The simulations were run for 172106 CG.

The depicted process is also shown in Movie S1. (Bottom) Time series profile depicting tIC1 evaluated for
the RBD of each protomer (sharing the same color) for the spike trimer depicted above, i.e., spike trimer

the top-down. To the right of the panel, the double-ended arrows represent the extent of the tIC1
distributions for each state from Fig. 1B, while the rectangle shows the peak of each distribution.

Throughout our simulations, we observed spike trimers fluctuating between the open and
closed state, with the former preceding ACE2 binding, as expected. Interestingly, we observed
spike trimers that were capable of binding to multiple ACE2 dimers, which required additional
opening of RBDs. However, we did not see multiple spike trimers binding to the same ACE2 dimer,
suggesting that any multivalent interactions between spike and ACE2 are due to an excess of
accessible ACE2 receptors.
Our simulations predict two modalities for ACE2-facilitated dissociation of S1. First, S1
dissociation appears to occur due to thermal fluctuations, which may happen both in the absence
and presence of binding between an open RBD and a single ACE2 dimer. The remaining two S1
monomers persist on the spike trimer, although in some cases, complete S1 shedding occurs after
secondary RBD opening and binding to a new ACE2 receptor. The second modality was observed
more frequently and involves the sequential binding of two ACE2 receptors to the same spike

trimer. Consequently, dissociation of all three S1 domains is accelerated and results in the
exposure of the S2 trimeric core (Movie S1).
We depict the representative elements of the multivalent ACE2-binding process in Fig. 2,
in addition to tIC1 time-series profiles for each RBD (additional examples are shown in Fig. S3).
Here, the observed effect on the bound spike trimer is one of processive release of S1 domains
in a cyclical fashion. The process generally adheres to the following sequential steps. First, RBDs
conformationally vary between the open and closed state, as seen for  < 5106 CG (note the
variation of the cyan and pink lines/protomers in Fig. 2). One ACE2 dimer successfully binds to
the open RBD, pulling the RBD and enforcing the open state, as seen for  = 12106 CG (the cyan
protomer adopts tIC1 = 1.0 with reduced variance). The cleft formed between the upraised RBD
and the N-terminal arm of S1 provides a stabilizing pocket for the clockwise RBD (from a topdown view), or the green protomer as depicted in Fig. 2 (tIC1 = −0.6), thereby “tightening” the
adhesion of this S1 domain. Conversely, the counter-clockwise RBD, or the pink protomer as
depicted in Fig. 2, appears to “loosen” its adhesion to the same cleft provided by the green S1
domain. Due to the weakened interactions, the pink protomer dynamically adopts the partiallyclosed state, as seen between 15106 <  < 20106 CG (pink line/protomer in Fig. 2 with tIC1 =
−0.25). Thermal fluctuations allow the pink protomer to spontaneously adopt the open state (
= 26106 CG). A second ACE2 dimer binds to the newly exposed RBD and “pulls” this S1 domain
away from the spike, thereby promoting dissociation ( = 30106 CG). The remaining S1 dimer
complex, which remains bound to the first ACE2 dimer, subsequently “loosens” and eventually
dissociates due to thermal fluctuations ( = 45106 CG). Finally, the S1-bound ACE2 dimers diffuse
away from the spike trimer, which now consists of the exposed S2 trimeric core ( > 50106 CG).
Prior experimental binding assays using soluble ACE2 have demonstrated positive
cooperativity when binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers (21). Our simulations show that
multivalent ACE2 interactions induce productive S1 dissociation, and further suggest that
exposure of the postfusion machinery may be cooperatively correlated with ACE2 expression. To
test this hypothesis, we prepared additional triplicate simulations with the same spike trimer
density but varied the ACE2 density. Here, we tested stoichiometric ratios of [ACE2dimer]/[Strimer]

between 0 and 4, the latter representing 100 ACE2 dimers and 25 spike trimers, and performed
simulations for 172106 CG. The final 12.5106 CG were used for analysis.

fraction of S1 monomers bound to ACE2 (blue), S1 monomers dissociated from the spike trimer (red), and

density of ACE2 (in #/nm2) to the natural log of the fraction of S1 monomers bound to ACE2 or the fraction

coefficients (nH) equal to 1.45 and 2.02. All data points report the mean and standard error from triplicate
simulations.

We summarize statistics on the extent of ACE2 binding, S1 dissociation, and S2 trimeric
core exposure as [ACE2dimer]/[Strimer] is varied in Fig. 3A. We used a distance-based metric
(described in Methods) to determine both binding and dissociation events. First, we find that S1
monomers are capable of spontaneous dissociation due to thermal fluctuations in the absence
of ACE2, as noted above. Within our simulated timescales, however, none of these dissociation
events resulted in complete S2 trimeric core exposure. As S1 dissociation was not observed in
our atomistic MD simulations, nor during training of the CG model, we speculate that the
collective membrane fluctuations, further induced by the spike trimer inclusions, promote S1
dissociation as bound S1 should be considered a metastable state.
The presence of ACE2 has intriguing effects on binding, dissociation, and exposure
statistics. To measure the degree of cooperativity, we fit our binding data to the Hill equation:
ln

Θ
= 𝑛𝐻 ln[𝐴] + 𝑐
1−Θ

where  is the fraction of S1 monomers bound to ACE2, [𝐴] is the surface density of ACE2, nH is
the Hill coefficient, and c is a constant. As seen in Fig. 3B, we find that nH > 1 (= 1.45) for the

binding curve, indicating that S1 binding to ACE2 is positively cooperative. In Fig. 3A, both the
extent of S1 dissociation and S2 trimeric core exposure appear to monotonically increase with
[ACE2dimer]/[Strimer]. Note that the relative ratio between S1 dissociation and S2 core exposure
significantly decreases when [ACE2dimer]/[Strimer] ratios exceed 2. In fact, as seen in Fig. 3B, the
propensity for S2 core exposure when [ACE2dimer]/[Strimer] > 2 also exhibits positive cooperativity
with nH = 2.02. Together, these results suggest that multivalent ACE2 binding promotes S1
dissociation events that productively expose the S2 trimeric core, and eventually, the postfusion
machinery.

Discussion
We developed and applied CG simulation models of SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers and
receptor ACE2 dimers to study the dynamical mechanisms involved in viral avidity and
dissociation, the latter being a necessary step prior to membrane fusion. Our simulations
recapitulate the metastability of the S1 domains, which remain bound to spike trimers after furin
cleavage. Although rare, we observed spontaneous dissociation of S1 even in the absence of ACE2
binding, consistent with cryo-EM characterization of postfusion trimers on mature virions (4, 5).
It has been shown that the D614G mutation is more infectious and stabilizes interactions
between S1 and S2 that prevent dissociation (22), promotes RBD opening (23, 24), and increases
ACE2 affinity (25). Ostensibly, the D614G mutation prevents premature S1 dissociation and
facilitates productive RBD-ACE2 binding, while ACE2-mediated S1 dissociation remains
unimpeded. It would be valuable for future atomistic and CG simulations to ascertain how D614G
and related mutations (e.g. the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, and P.1 variants) affect spike trimer
stability before, during, and after ACE2 binding.
One of our key findings is that the primary binding modality between spike trimers and
ACE2 dimers involves multiple ACE2 dimers binding to single spike trimers, rather than multiple
spike trimers binding to the same ACE2 dimer, an observation that is consistent with split
reporter assays of soluble spike trimers incubated with ACE2 dimers (26). We found that spike
trimer binding exhibits positive cooperativity with ACE2 dimer density due to the multivalent
nature of ACE2 binding. Soluble ACE2 has also been observed to cooperatively bind to SARS-CoV-

11

2 spike trimers, yet interestingly, not for SARS-CoV-1 spike trimers (21). Finally, our simulations
suggest that the multivalency of the ACE2 to spike trimer interaction is necessary to facilitate
complete dissociation of the S1 monomers that occlude the S2 trimeric core, which contains the
viral fusion machinery. Binding to ACE2 induces a cyclical tightening and loosening process that
processively weakens S1 interactions, both to adjacent S1 monomers and to the underlying S2
core, which leads to S1 dissociation. On the basis of cryo-EM maps of soluble spike trimers bound
to soluble ACE2, it was recently proposed that the three RBDs throughout the spike trimer open
and bind to ACE2 in a processive fashion, eventually resulting in simultaneous dissociation of the
three S1 monomers due to reduced contacts between neighboring monomers (8). The process
we observe in our simulations is conceptually similar, although we propose that only two ACE2
dimers are minimally necessary for productive uncoating of S1, and the counter-clockwise S1
(from a top-down view) from the initial ACE2-bound S1 tends to open, bind to a second ACE2,
and dissociate first.
One notable difference between the conditions of our simulations and the experiments
discussed above is that both our spike trimers and ACE2 dimers are tethered to their respective
membranes in a more realistic system than solubilized proteins. The tethers inherently restrict
the diffusion and conformational motions available to both spike and ACE2 proteins. One
potential consequence is that the relative populations of different spike/ACE2 complexes for
solubilized proteins may not reflect populations at the interface between virions and host cells.
Likewise, these populations are likely dependent upon the relative stoichiometry of spike trimers
and ACE2 dimers, as our simulations indicate. We suggest that the use of fluid membrane-bound
spike trimers and ACE2 receptors in biochemical and structural characterization of viral avidity,
e.g., as seen in the work of Yang et al. and Lu et al. (27, 28), compared to assays using soluble
components, may prove to be characteristically different. For example, single-molecule Förster
resonance energy transfer analysis suggests that spike trimers bound to one or two ACE2
receptors exhibit asymmetry throughout the three spike protomers (28), which is consistent with
the dynamical behavior observed in our CG simulations.
Our analysis also motivates several directions for future simulations. While researchers
have explored the free energy surface of single RBD open-close transitions (29, 30), the

thermodynamics of secondary and tertiary RBD opening, as well as the role of multivalent ACE2
binding, should be thoroughly investigated. We note that our current CG model will also likely
require additional features to holistically probe SARS-CoV-2 virion binding, fusion, and entry.
Here, we investigated spike trimer and ACE2 dimer association at the interface of two planar
membranes. However, it will be important to elucidate the effects of virion curvature (between
70-120 nm diameters (5)), which likely impose additional restrictions to spike trimer
conformational sampling while seeking ACE2 receptors. Sophisticated modeling approaches to
incorporate large-scale conformational changes, such as the extension of the heptad repeat
coiled coil in the postfusion state (6), will also be necessary. In this work, we linearly mixed two
model Hamiltonians that represent different configurational states (open and closed RBDs).
Several additional approaches, including plastic network models (31) and multi-configurational
coarse-graining (32), may prove useful to construct CG models capable of state transitions with
increased accuracy for state populations and transition rates. These efforts will expand the
capabilities of CG modeling, which in turn will provide valuable insight into collective molecular
phenomena during SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as the role of cooperative multivalent ACE2
binding to induce spike trimer uncoating reported herein.

Atomistic MD simulations. Trajectories from prior atomistic MD simulations of the spike trimer
in membrane were used to derive effective CG Hamiltonians (16, 33). Statistics for the open and
closed state of the spike trimer were supplemented with additional triplicate simulations of the
spike ectodomain using PDB 6VYB and 6VXX as initial structures, respectively (3). Triplicate
simulations of the ACE2 dimer interacting with bound RBDs were also prepared using an initial

performed using GROMACS 2020 (36). Minimization was performed using steepest descent until
the maximum force was reduced to 1,000 kJ/mol/nm2. Then, equilibration was performed in
several phases. First, 10 ns were integrated in the constant NVT ensemble using the stochastic
velocity rescaling thermostat (37) with a damping time of 0.2 ps and a timestep of 1 fs. During
this phase, the C backbone of the protein was harmonically restrained with a force constant of
1,000 kJ/mol/nm2. An additional 40 ns were integrated in the constant NPT ensemble using the
stochastic velocity rescaling thermostat (37) (2 ps damping time) and the Parrinello-Rahman
barostat (38) (10 ps damping time) and a timestep of 2 fs. Finally, an additional 1650 ns were
integrated in the constant NVT ensemble using the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat (39) (2 ps
damping time) and a timestep of 2 fs. Throughout this procedure, H-containing bonds were
constrained using the LINCS algorithm (40). Statistics were gathered every 100 ps and the final
1,200 ns of each trajectory was used for CG model generation.

CG modeling. CG model generation for the protein constituents proceeded in three phases. The
first phase determined the mapping between atomistic and CG sites. Mapping was performed
using essential dynamics coarse-graining (EDCG) (41) with resolutions chosen to balance between
computational efficiency and least-squared error in the represented principal component
subspace. Monomers of S1, S2, and ACE2 were mapped to 60, 50, and 70 CG sites, respectively;
each N-linked glycan (42) was mapped to a single site, totaling 13, 9, and 7 sites, respectively.
The second phase determined the effective CG Hamiltonian for each protein. We
systematically determined parameters for S1/S2 in the open state, S1/S2 in the closed state, and
ACE2 in the bound state, as well as their inter-domain interactions. The Hamiltonian (Etot) was
decomposed into four terms: intra-domain fluctuations (Eintra), inter-domain exclusion (Eexcl),
inter-domain attraction (Eattr), and screened electrostatics (Eyukawa):
𝐸𝑡𝑜𝑡 = 𝐸𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎 + 𝐸𝑒𝑥𝑐𝑙 + 𝐸𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟 + 𝐸𝑦𝑢𝑘𝑎𝑤𝑎
where Eintra was represented as a hetero-elastic network model (hENM) (43) with bond energies
𝑘 (𝑟 − 𝑟0 )2 where k is the spring constant of a particular bond and r0 is the equilibrium bond
length. These parameters were optimized using the hENM method with a cutoff distance of 3, 4,

charge of CG site 𝑖,  = 1.274 nm-1 is the inverse Debye length for 150 mM NaCl, and r is the
effective dielectric constant of the protein environment, approximated as 17.5 (45).
The third phase determined an effective Hamiltonian for the spike trimer that was
capable of continuously transitioning between the open and closed state. Here, we modified
Eintra, Eexcl, and Eattr as follows. For Eintra, we kept bonds that appeared in both open and closed
states and used the mean k and r0 constants. For Eexcl, we used the minimum rc from both open
and closed states. For Eattr, we tested different linear combinations of the Gaussians parametrized
from the open and closed state. We found that an equal mix recapitulated open/closed statistics
the best, i.e., 𝐸𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟 = 0.5𝐸𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟,𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 + 0.5𝐸𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑟,𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒𝑑 . No modification of Eyukawa was needed since
this term is not state dependent.
The lipid model used the functional form from Ref. (17) with tuned parameters listed in
the Supplementary Information. For the purposes of modeling the interaction between the
transmembrane domains of the spike trimer/ACE2 dimer and lipids, we effectively considered
the transmembrane domain as having the same interaction as the lipids. Complete details on
protein and lipid model parametrization are provided in Supplementary Information.

CG simulations. All simulations were prepared using PACKMOL and Moltemplate (46, 47). Briefly,
CG spike trimers and ACE2 dimers were arranged in a grid using each density described in the

main text. Two CG lipid membranes were randomly packed around the transmembrane domains
of each grid of proteins in a 200200 nm2 lateral (xy) domain; the z dimension of the box was
fixed to 160 nm. The two membranes were then translated along the z direction until the
minimum z distance between spike trimers and ACE2 dimers was 2 nm. All simulations were
performed using LAMMPS (48). Conjugate gradient energy minimization was performed on each
system until the change in force was less than 10-6. Then, proteins were held fixed while lipids
were integrated using a Langevin thermostat at 310 K (0.5 ps damping constant) and a Berendsen
barostat at 1 atm (0.5 ps damping constant, applied over the lateral xy dimension) over 2106 CG
(with CG = 50 fs). During this process, the xy simulation domain compressed to around 170170
nm2. We then integrated both proteins and lipids using a Langevin thermostat at 310 K (5 ps
damping constant) over 170106 CG. Trajectory snapshots were saved every 25103 CG.

Analysis. All analysis was performed using a combination of custom Tcl scripts using VMD (49)
and Python scripts using the MSMBuilder (50) and MDTraj (51) libraries. The configurational state
of each RBD was featurized using the DRID method (18). Dimensional reduction (via tICA (19)) of
this feature set into 10 tICs was performed using a lag time of 40103 CG; the values of the first
tIC eigenvector are shown in Fig. S1. The data were then clustered into 3 sets using k-means
clustering (20). We featurized and projected the configuration of each RBD extracted from our
CG simulations onto the first tIC to classify its state. We also used the following distance metric
to classify the bound state of the S1 domain to both its partner S2 domain and ACE2:

where ii and jj refer to CG site indices out of a set with Nii and Njj total sites, r is the position, d is
the distance, and | | is the norm of the vector. In other words, we compute the distance between
the centers of geometry of sets of CG sites. We chose CG site clusters that were observed to have
close association distances with minimal fluctuation during CG model training. For S1/S2 binding,
these included site indices 31-32 and 54-57 for S1 and 77, 87-89, 98-99, and 102 for S2. For
S1/ACE2 binding, these included site indices 43-49 for S1 and 134-137, 158, and 162 for ACE2
(residue mapping for each site is shown in Supplementary Tables 1-3). Using this metric, we
