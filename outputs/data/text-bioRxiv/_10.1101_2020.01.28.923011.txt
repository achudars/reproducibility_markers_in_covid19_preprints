ABSTRACT

27

The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 800

28

laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 25 deaths, posing a serious threat to

29

human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine.

30

Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in

31

2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of

32

anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have

33

important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies

34

against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific

35

human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD

36

(KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site

37

within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as

38

candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for

39

the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most

40

potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target

41

the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein,

42

indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical

43

impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary

44

to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV

45

RBD.

47

Very recently, a novel coronavirus which was temporarily named “2019 novel

48

coronavirus (2019-nCoV)” emerged in Wuhan, China [1]. As of 24 January, 2020,

49

2019-nCoV has resulted in a total of 830 laboratory-confirmed human infections,

50

including 25 deaths, in 29 provinces and regions in China, and a number of exported

51

cases

52

(http://www.chinacdc.cn/jkzt/crb/zl/szkb_11803/jszl_11809/202001/t20200124_2114

53

11.html). The person-to-person spread has been confirmed by the findings that there

54

were 15 medical care personnel infections and several family transmission cases,

55

indicating the severe infectivity and pathogenicity of this virus. Currently, however,

56

there is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment against 2019-nCoV infection.

in

countries

57

Based on the phylogenetic analysis (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_402124) [2],

58

2019-nCoV belongs to lineage B betacoronavirus and shares high sequence identity

59

with that of bat or human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related

60

coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) (Figure 1a). In

61

previous studies, a number of potent monoclonal antibodies against SARS

62

coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been identified [3-7]. These antibodies target the spike

63

protein (S) of SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs, which is a type I transmembrane

64

glycoprotein and mediates the entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by

65

interacting with cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [8].

66

More specifically, the 193 amino acid length (N318-V510) receptor binding domain

67

(RBD) within S protein is the critical target for neutralizing antibodies [9]. We

68

predicted the conformation of 2019-nCoV RBD as well as its complex structures with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011; this version posted January 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

69

several neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Methods), and found that the

70

modelling results support the interactions between 2019-nCoV RBD and certain

71

SARS-CoV antibodies (Figure 1b). This could be due to the relatively high identity

72

(73%) of RBD in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV (Figure 1c). For instance, residues in

73

RBD of SARS-CoV that make polar interactions with a neutralizing antibody m396 as

74

indicated by the complex crystal structure [10] are invariably conserved in

75

2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 1d). In the structure of SARS-CoV-RBD-m396, R395 in

76

RBD formed a salt bridge with D95 of m396-VL. Concordantly, the electrostatic

77

interaction was also observed in the model of 2019-nCoV-RBD-m396, forming by

78

R408

79

SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibodies may be effective in neutralizing

80

2019-nCoV. In contrast, the interactions between antibody F26G19 [11] or 80R [12]

81

and the RBD in 2019-nCoV decreased significantly due to the lack of salt bridges

82

formed

83

SARS-CoV-RBD-80R, respectively. Furthermore, while most of the 80R-binding

84

residues on the RBD of SARS-CoV are not conserved on RBD of 2019-nCoV (Figure

85

1c), it is unlikely that the antibody 80R could effectively recognize 2019-nCoV.

86

Therefore, it is urgent to experimentally determine the cross-reactivity of

87

anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have

88

important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies

89

against 2019-nCoV.

91

(Supplementary Methods). We also predicted the conformations of 2019-nCoV RBD

92

and its complex with the putative receptor, human ACE2 (Supplementary Methods).

93

Comparison of the interaction between complex of ACE2 [13] and SARS-CoV RBD

94

and homology model of ACE2 and 2019-nCoV RBD revealed similar binding modes

95

(data not shown). In both complexes, β5-β6 loop and β6-β7 loop form extensive

96

contact, including at least seven pairs of hydrogen bonds, with the receptor. Notably,

97

R426 on the forth α helix in SARS-CoV RBD builds a salt bridge with E329 and a

98

hydrogen bond with Q325 on ACE2. However, the arginine (R426 in SARS-CoV

99

RBD) to asparagine (N439) mutation in 2019-nCoV RBD abolished the strong polar

100

interactions, which may induce a decrease in the binding affinity between RBD and

101

the receptor. Interestingly, a lysine (K417 in 2019-nCoV RBD) replacement of valine

102

(V404 in SARS-CoV RBD) on β6 formed an extra salt bridge with D30 on ACE2,

103

which may recover the binding ability. These data indicate that the RBD in S protein

104

of 2019-nCoV may bind to ACE2 with the similar affinity as SARS-CoV RBD does.

105

Indeed, we measured the binding of 2019-nCoV RBD to human ACE2 by the biolayer

106

interferometry binding (BLI) assay, and found that 2019-nCoV RBD bound potently

107

to ACE2. The calculated affinity (KD) of 2019-nCoV RBD with human ACE2 was

108

15.2 nM (Figure 1f), which is comparable to that of SARS-CoV spike protein with

109

human ACE2 (15 nM) [14]. These results indicate that ACE2 could be the potential

110

receptor for the new coronavirus, and that the expressed 2019-nCoV RBD protein is

111

functional [2].

112

Next, we expressed and purified several representative SARS-CoV-specific

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.28.923011; this version posted January 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

113

antibodies (Supplementary Methods) which have been reported to target RBD and

114

possess potent neutralizing activities, including m396 [3], CR3014 [4], CR3022 [5],

115

as well as a MERS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody m336 developed by our

116

laboratory [15], and measured their binding ability to 2019-nCoV RBD by ELISA

117

(Supplementary Methods, Figure 1e). Surprisingly, we found that most of these

118

antibodies did not show evident binding to 2019-nCoV RBD. To confirm this result,

119

we further measured the binding kinetics using BLI (Supplementary Methods). An

120

irrelevant anti-CD40 antibody was used as negative control. Similarly, the antibody

121

m396, which was predicted to bind 2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 1d), only showed slight

122

binding at the highest measured concentration (2 µM). Interestingly, we found that

123

there are several additional asparagine residues in 2019-nCoV RBD as compared with

124

SARS-CoV RBD. For instance, the N439 residue is located in the receptor binding

125

site within 2019-nCoV RBD. It could be hypothesized that Asn-linked glycosylation

126

may occur, rendering the computationally simulated models far from the native

127

structures. Further studies are needed to solve the high-resolution structure of

128

2019-nCoV RBD and understand why it could not be recognized by these antibodies.

129

Notably, one SARS-CoV-specific antibody, CR3022, was found to bind potently

130

with 2019-nCoV RBD as determined by ELISA and BLI (Figure 1e, 1f). It followed a

131

fast-on (kon of 1.84×105 Ms-1) and slow-off (koff of 1.16×10-3 s-1) binding kinetics,

132

resulting in a KD of 6.3 nM (Figure 1f). This antibody was isolated from blood of a

133

convalescent SARS patient, and did not compete with the antibody CR3014 for

134

binding to recombinant S protein [5]. To further elucidate the binding epitopes of

135

CR3022, we measured the competition of CR3022 and human ACE2 for the binding

136

to 2019-nCoV RBD (Supplementary Methods). The streptavidin biosensors labelled

137

with biotinylated 2019-nCoV RBD were saturated with human ACE2 in solution,

138

followed by the addition of the test antibodies in the presence of ACE2. As shown in

139

Figure 1g, the antibody CR3022 did not show any competition with ACE2 for the

140

binding to 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022, distinct from the

141

other two SARS-CoV antibodies, recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the

142

ACE2 binding site of 2019-nCoV RBD.

143

The RBD of 2019-nCoV differ largely from the SARS-CoV at the C-terminus

144

residues (Figure 1c). Our results implied that such difference did not result in drastic

145

changes in the capability to engage the ACE2 receptor, but had a critical impact for

146

the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies. Some of the most potent

147

SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the

148

receptor binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein,

149

indicating that it is necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind

150

specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD. Interestingly, it was reported that the antibody

151

CR3022 could neutralize the antibody CR3014 escape viruses, and that no escape

152

variants could be generated with CR3022 [5]. Furthermore, the mixture of CR3022

153

and CR3014 neutralized SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different

154

epitopes on RBD [5]. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as

155

candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for

156

the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. We expect more cross-reactive
