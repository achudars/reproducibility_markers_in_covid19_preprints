Abstract

48

COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people with mortality exceeding 300,000. There is

49

an urgent need to find therapeutic agents that can help clear the virus to prevent the severe

50

disease and death. Identifying effective and safer drugs can provide with more options to treat

51

the COVID-19 infections either alone or in combination. Here we performed a high throughput

52

screen of approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to identify novel therapeutic agents

53

that can effectively inhibit replication of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our two-step

54

screen first used a human coronavirus strain OC43 to identify compounds with anti-coronaviral

55

activities. The effective compounds were then screened for their effectiveness in inhibiting

56

SARS-CoV-2. These screens have identified 24 anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs including previously

57

reported compounds such as hydroxychloroquine, amlodipine, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone

58

2HCl, dronedarone hydrochloride, and merfloquine hydrochloride. Five of the newly identified

59

drugs had a safety index (cytotoxic/effective concentration) of >600, indicating wide therapeutic

60

window compared to hydroxychloroquine which had safety index of 22 in similar experiments.

61

Mechanistically, five of the effective compounds were found to block SARS-CoV-2 S protein-

62

mediated cell fusion. These FDA approved compounds can provide much needed therapeutic

63

options that we urgently need in the midst of the pandemic.

Introduction

71

Novel coronavirus mediated disease (COVID-19) emerged as a major pandemic and has spread

72

across the world in such a short span of time since Dec 2019. As of May 15, 2020, more than 4.5

73

million confirmed infections have been reported with approximately 308,000 deaths (WHO,

74

situation report 116). These numbers may be a vast underestimation as many of the infected

75

patients may remain asymptomatic and can only be detected by antibody testing1. Similarly,

76

many of the deaths may not be accounted due to lack of testing. The disease is caused by a novel

77

coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2 which belongs to the Coronaviridae family and is the third

78

major coronavirus pandemic in last 20 years after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

79

and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)2-7. The lack of available therapeutic options is a

80

major limiting factor in treating these infections which leads to excessive mortality.

81

Currently, there is an urgent and unmet need of effective antiviral therapy that can not only

82

decrease the disease burden in the patient but can also decrease the ability of the person to infect

83

others. Developing a novel drug many take years to confirm the safety and efficacy, which may

84

not be practical to deal with a widespread pandemic that is killing thousands of people every day.

85

Alternatively, it sounds a lucrative option to repurpose US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

86

approved drugs for their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Earlier screens have found antiviral

87

efficacy of approved therapies such as hydroxychloroquine8-12, however, these therapies failed to

88

provide any beneficial effects in COVID-19 due to their toxic side effects13-18. Finding efficacy

89

of an approved drug against SARS-CoV-2 with minimal toxicity can provide much needed

90

therapeutic option to treat COVID-19.

91

Here we screened approximately 1700 US FDA approved compounds to test their ability to

92

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data report finds 24 compounds that are highly effective in

93

inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication at concentrations that were significantly lower than those

94

having cytotoxic effects. We also investigated possible mechanism of these compounds.

95

Results

96

Inhibitory potential of FDA approved drugs against human coronavirus OC43. Initial

97

screening was performed using HCoV-OC43 due to its low biosafety concerns. OC43 is a human

98

coronavirus that usually causes mild disease in humans and cattle19. The experimental protocol is

99

demonstrated in Fig. 1A using LLC-MK2 cells which were infected with OC43 at a MOI of 1 for

100

48 h in presence of the US FDA licensed compounds. The inhibitory potentials of these

101

compounds were measured with the treatment of compounds at 10 μM for 48 hours. The viral

102

presence was detected by immunostaining for the virus and DAPI staining for the cell nuclei.

103

The inhibitory capacity was measured by using the ratio of viral fluorescence to the DAPI and is

104

depicted in Fig. 1B. The initial screen obtained 231 compounds that had ability to inhibit OC43

105

replication >95%. The remdesivir was used to as a positive control (Fig. 1 C and D).

106

Calculation of IC50, CC50 and SI of FDA approved drugs against OC43. Next, we sought to

107

determine the effective concentrations of positively screened drugs in our initial approach and

108

test the toxicity profile of these drugs in relation to their viral inhibitory concentrations. Our data

109

show that vast majority of the positively screened drugs were effective in inhibiting the viral

110

replication at sub-micromolar concentrations including many of them can almost completely

111

inhibit the viral replication at micromolar range (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, the effective drugs against

112

the coronavirus belonged to a wide range of therapeutic groups including those used for

113

neurological diseases, hormones, enzymes and antimicrobial agents among others (Table 1). The

114

cytotoxic concentration to kill 50% cells (CC50) was noted for these drugs by measuring cell

115

viability over similar concentrations. The selective index in our study was found to be >600 for 5

116

of the screened compounds. The SI for the hydroxychloroquine was 22 in our study, indicating

117

increased safety of newly identified drugs compared to the hydroxychloroquine.

118

Testing the antiviral effectiveness of positive drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we sought

119

to determine whether these compounds can show efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative

120

agent of COVID-19. Positive compounds from the initial screen were tested for their antiviral

121

efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. SARS-CoV-2 replicates within the Vero cells and

122

causes cytopathic effects in these cells in absence of any antiviral treatment. We generated the

123

dose response inhibition curves along with the cytotoxicity curves for these compounds in

124

presence of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3). Our data show that 24 of these compounds show significant

125

efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication with sub micromolar IC50 for many of these

126

drugs such as nilotinib, clofazimine and raloxifene. The effects also confirmed by

127

immunofluorescence assay (data not shown). These compounds also belong to a wide variety of

128

classes including cardiac glycosides, anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, cyclooxygenase-2

129

inhibitors and ion channel blockers, among others. The IC50, CC50 and SI of these compounds

130

is shown in Table 2.

131

Five candidate drugs inhibit cell fusion. Finally, in order to clarify the mechanism by which

132

the compounds inhibit SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the effects of these candidates on virus

133

entry. First, we constructed the cell-cell fusion assays. As indicated in Fig 4, SARS-CoV-2 S

134

protein expression can initiate cell fusion with ACE2-overexpressed cells, but the control vector

135

did not. Then, we detected the effects of these indicated drugs on S protein-mediated cell fusion.

136

Indicated drugs were added to cells before co-incubation of the cells. We found that digoxin and

137

ouabain octahydrate induced cell death, but not other indicated drugs. Interestingly, fendiline

hydrochloride, monensin sodium salt, vortioxetine, sertraline hydrochloride, and raloxifene

139

hydrochloride inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell fusion (Fig. 4).

140

Discussion

141

The current pandemic of COVID-19 is the third major outbreak in this century and the largest

142

outbreak of the coronavirus in known human history. The three novel coronavirus outbreaks in

143

such a short span of time are strong indicators of potential threat posed by coronaviruses. While

144

majority of the respiratory viral infection research has been focused on influenzas viruses which

145

causes huge burden of seasonal flu and occasionally pandemic outbreaks, coronavirus is likely to

146

emerge a similar or more severe pathogen than flu in long term.

147

Given the scale and devastation of the current COVID-19 outbreak, and persistent threat of

148

coronaviruses in causing human disease, there is urgent need to find effective and safe therapies

149

that can treat these patients. Currently, there are no approved therapies for coronaviruses

150

including SARS-CoV-2. The experimental therapies being used with known antiviral agents

151

either show limited efficacy (remdesivir) or have high systemic toxicity (hydroxychroquine),

152

limiting their usefulness20-22. Finding new therapies that are effective and safe are urgently

153

needed. In this study, we have identified many FDA approved therapies that are highly effective

154

against coronaviruses, including 24 of the agents that are effective against SARS-CoV-2. This

155

screening

156

hydroxychroquine, amlodipine besylate, arbidol hydrochloride, tilorone 2HCl, dronedarone

157

hydrochloride, tetrandrine, merfloquine, and thioridazine hydrochloride8-10, 23, while identifying

158

additional 14 drugs. The underlying mechanisms of viral replication inhibition by these drugs is

159

not clear. It is highly unlikely that these compounds will have similar antiviral mechanisms given

160

161

study. However, it is clear from other viral studies such as influenza or HIV, where antiviral

162

drugs can affect various steps in the viral life cycle including attachment, entry, replication,

163

assembly and budding of viral progeny. Five drugs may inhibit S-mediated cell fusion as

164

indicated by our data (Fig. 4). Further studies are required to understand the precise mechanisms

165

of each of the effective compounds found in this study.

166

Toxicity is one of the limiting factors in the therapeutic application of many drugs despite their

167

known antiviral activities. Many of these drugs had SI of > 600, showing promise of their

168

usefulness at safe doses. For comparison, the SI of hydroxychloroquine was found to be 22 in

169

our study while SI of amlodipine besylate was found to be ~3, demonstrating much lower safety

170

profile of this drug. Similarly, other drugs that are known to have low selective index such as

171

digoxin for their approved use, also show lower SI in our screen. Five of the drugs with SI

172

of >600 include tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib, antibiotics such as clofazimine and actidione,

173

selective estrogen receptor modulator such as raloxifene and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory

174

drug celecoxib.

175

etacoronaviruses have raised great public health threats to human beings, as most known HCoVs

176

including all the three virulent HCoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) and two

177

seasonal HCoVs (OC43 and HKU1) belong to this species3-7, 19, 24. It is of great value to identify

178

antivirals against a broad spectrum of HCoVs, particularly the Betacoronaviruses, to tackle such

179

threats by pharmaceutical interventions. To this end, we first screened the compounds which

180

showed apparent activity of anti-OC43, the most prevalent HCoV circulates worldwide25. We

181

then narrowed down the candidates by the screening on SARS-CoV-2, resulting in the

182

identification of 24 compounds which can inhibit both OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. Our study

183

provides a foundation for subsequent anti-HCoVs drug screening of broad spectrum. However,

184

further tests are warranted to verify their efficacies.

185

In summary, our screen identified 14 previously unknown FDA approved compounds that are

186

effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 beside confirming the antiviral properties of ten previously

187

reported compounds, validating our approach. This screen identified five new compounds that

188

are highly efficacious in inhibiting the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 with SI >600. Further

189

studies are needed to confirm the in vivo efficacy of these drugs in humans and COVID-19

190

relevant mouse models such as those with human ACE2 transgene26.

191

Materials and Methods

192

Cells and Viruses: LLC-MK2 cells (Rhesus monkey kidney cells) were cultured in 64% Hank’s

193

MEM and 32% Earle’s MEM (Gibco, New York, USA) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine

194

serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Utah, USA) and 1% glutamine (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA). Vero

195

cells (African green monkey kidney cell) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium

196

(DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS.

197

Human coronavirus (HCoV) strain OC43 was propagated in LLC-MK2 cells in 0.5% FBS MEM

198

and virus titers were determined via TCID50 with LLC-MK2 cells. SARS-CoV-2 virus was

199

isolated from the respiratory samples of patients in Wuhan of Hubei Province (3). SARS-CoV-2

200

virus was propagated in Vero cells and used in this study. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2

201

virus were conducted in BSL-3 laboratory.

202

HEK293T cells stably expressing recombinant human ACE2 (293T/hACE2) were maintained in

205

Antibodies: Mouse polyclonal against OC43 N antibody was prepared in the laboratory. Rabbit

206

polyclonal against SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibody was purchased from Sino Biological

207

(Beijing, China). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated

208

goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Thermo.

209

Screening of FDA-approved drugs: US FDA-approved drug library which contain 1700

210

compounds was purchased from TargetMol (Massachusetts, USA). LLC-MK2 cells were seeded

211

at 2×104 cells per well in 96-well plates and incubated at 37℃ and 5% CO2. The next day, LLC-

212

MK2 cells were treated with the compounds at a concentration of 10μM. After 1 h of treatment,

213

cells were infected with OC43 at MOI of 1. At 48 h post infection (hpi), cells were fixed with 4%

214

paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Immunofluorescence staining was performed

215

using mouse anti-OC43 NP antibody, followed by anti-mouse Alexa Flour 488 and DAPI (Sigma,

216

St. Louis, MO). Images were captured by Operetta (PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA) at the

217

magnification of 20×objective. The infection ratios were calculated using automated image

218

analysis software (Harmony 3.5.2, PerkinElmer). Remdesivir and DMSO were used as positive

219

and negative controls, respectively.

220

The positively identified drugs from this screen were used to perform dose response curves

221

against OC43 on LLC-MK2 and against SARS-CoV-2 using Vero cells as described below.

228

cells

229

Immunofluorescence was conducted with mouse anti-OC43 N protein antibody, or rabbit anti-

230

SARS-CoV-2-NP antibody, and followed by anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit Alexa Flour 488 and

231

DAPI. Images were performed by Operetta with 20× objective. The IC50 were calculated using

232

automated image analysis software (Harmony 3.5.2, PerkinElmer).

233

For CC50, cells were pre-treated with each drug at concentrations 0.013, 0.041, 0.123, 0.370,

234

1.111, 3.333, 10, 30 μM, respectively. After 48h (LLC-MK2 cells) or 24h (Vero cells) post

235

treatment, cell viability was evaluated by using a CCK8 kit (Yeasen, Beijing, China) according

236

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Selectivity index was calculated using following formula:

237

SI=CC50/IC50. Graphpad Prism 7.0 was used for analyzing IC50 and CC50.

238

Immunofluorescence: Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room

239

temperature, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were then blocked

240

with 5% BSA and stained with primary antibodies, followed by staining with an Alexa Fluor 488

241

secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.

242

Quantitative RT-PCR: Vero cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of drugs for

243

1h and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 at 0.1 MOI for 1h. Then, cells were washed with opti-MEM

244

for one time and incubated with indicated concentrations of drugs. At 24 hpi, supernatants were

245

collected and viral RNA in the cell supernatants were extracted by using Direct-zol RNA

246

MiniPrep kit (Zymo research, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral

247

copy numbers were measured by RT-PCR using primers and probe targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N

248

gene. The reference standard was tenfold diluted from 1×109 copies to 1×104 copies. PCR

249

amplification procedure was 50℃, 15min, 95℃, 3min; 95℃, 15s, 60℃, 45s+Plate Read, 50

all completed by fluorescence quantitative PCR and its own software (Bio-Rad CFX Manager).

252

The copies of virus were calculated according to the standard curve. The inhibition ratio was

253

obtained by dividing the number of copies of the virus in the vehicle control group. The data

254

were nonlinear fitting by graphpad 7.0 software to calculate IC50 of each drug.

255

Cell-cell fusion assay: Cell-cell fusion assays were performed as described previously (19).

256

Briefly, HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with SARS-CoV-2-S glycoprotein and eGFP. At

257

24 h post transfection, cells were digested with trypsin (0.25%) and overlaid on a 50% confluent

258

monolayer of 293T-ACE2 cells at a ratio of 1:1 which were treated with candidate drugs for 1h.

259

After 24h incubation, images of syncytia were captured with Operetta (PerkinElmer,

260

Massachusetts, USA).

357

antiviral drugs that effectively inhibit OC43 replication. LLC-MK2 cells were pretreated with

358

FDA-approved drugs at 10μM for 1h and infected with 1 MOI of OC43 for 48h. Cells were then

359

fixed and stained to calculate the infection ratio with Operetta software. B. Primary screening

with the rate of OC43 inhibition. C. Image samples show signals of OC43 infection in cell

362

cultures. LLC-MK2 cells were treated with indicated doses of remdesivir for 1h, and then cells

363

were infected with OC43 for 48 h. D. Cell viability of remdesivir to LLC-MK2 cells were

364

measured by CCK-8 assays. The % inhibitions were calculated according to the data in C.
