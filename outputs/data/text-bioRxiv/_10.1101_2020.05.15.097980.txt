Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has several enzymes that could be
targeted by antivirals including a 2'-O RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is involved in the viral RNA
cap formation; an essential process for RNA stability. This MTase is composed of two nonstructural
proteins, the nsp16 catalytic subunit and the activating nsp10 protein. We have solved the crystal
structure of the nsp10-nsp16 complex bound to the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin in the active site.
Based on the structural data we built a model of the MTase in complex with RNA that illustrates the
catalytic reaction. A structural comparison to the Zika MTase revealed low conservation of the catalytic
site between these two RNA viruses suggesting preparation of inhibitors targeting both these viruses
will be very difficult. Together, our data will provide the information needed for structure-based drug
design.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the global pandemic of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which has currently led to hundred thousands of deaths and threatens
to decimate lives of millions if not billions by causing a global economic crisis.[1] Coronaviruses have
long been a threat, but recent developments show that they should be classified as extremely dangerous
pathogens and that we must develop effective means to suppress and treat the diseases caused by these
viruses.[2] Currently, there is no approved treatment for diseases caused by coronaviruses and therefore
there is a pressing need for the discovery and development of novel therapeutic agents for treatment of
COVID-19 and other coronavirus infections.[3] Directly acting antiviral agents have revolutionized the
treatment of numerous viral disease such as hepatitis B and C and AIDS [4, 5] and such a compound,
remdesivir, was also very recently FDA approved for emergency treatment of COVID-19 patients.
These therapeutics directly aim at a certain viral protein and, therefore, a deeper understanding of the
function of individual viral proteins is needed to develop future therapies of COVID-19 and other
possible coronavirus infections.
Coronaviruses have the largest genomes of all RNA viruses. In particular, the genome of SARS-CoV-2
has ~29 800 bases, which encodes four structural and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1 - nsp16) that
are essential for the replication of this virus. [6, 7] As all positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses
(+RNA viruses), SARS-CoV-2 is able to take full advantage of the cell environment and use it for its
replication. [8] Importantly, viral RNA must be protected from the cellular innate immunity. One of the
most important elements that ensures the integrity of viral RNA is the cap, a specific arrangement at the
5 'end of the RNA molecule that consists of a N-methylated guanosine triphosphate and C2’-O-methylrybosyladenine (type 1 cap, Figure 1). This arrangement resembles the native mRNA of the host cells,
stabilizes the RNA, and ensures effective process of its
translation. In human cells, however, the cap is installed
on newly transcribed mRNA already in the nucleus, to
which coronaviruses do not have access. Instead, they
possess their own cap-synthesizing enzymes. Clearly,
this process is essential for the survival and further
replication of viral RNA in cells. In principle, four
different processes are necessary for installation of a type
1 cap on RNA (either human mRNA or coronavirus
RNA). First, the -phosphate from a 5’-triphosphate end
of the nascent RNA is removed by 5’-RNA
triphosphatase. Second, a guanosine monophosphate
(GMP) is attached to the formed 5’-diphosphate end of
RNA by a guanylyltransferase using GTP as the source
of GMP. Finally, the methylation steps take place. In this
case, two separate enzymatic steps are required: one for

of the following nucleotide.
Coronaviruses use sequence installation of the cap that is performed by several nonstructural proteins
(nsp) encoded by their genome. For coronaviruses, nsp10, 13, 14 and 16 proteins appear to be involved
in this process.[9] The primary function of nsp13 protein is the unwinding of viral RNA during the
replication. Therefore, it is considered to be essentially the helicase. However, it is also a protein with a
5’-RNA triphosphatase activity responsible for cleaving monohosphate at the 5’-end of the nascent RNA

to provide a diphosphate.[10] There is still no clear evidence for any of the coronavirus proteins to
possess the guanylyltransferase function associated with the cap creation.[9] Nsp14 and nsp16 are
responsible for the methylation of the cap on the guanine of the GTP and the C2’ hydroxyl group of the
following nucleotide, respectively. Both nsp14 and nsp16 are S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent
methyltransferases (MTases) and seem to be essential for the viral life-cycle.[7] In particular, nsp16
appears to be a very promising molecular target from the perspective of medicinal chemistry and drug
design. It has been shown that this 2’-O methyltransferase (MTase) is indispensable for replication of
coronaviruses in cell cultures.[11, 12] Enzymatic activities of both these MTases (nsp14 and nsp16) are
significantly enhanced by nsp10, which is a necessary cofactor for their proper function.[12-16]
Here we report on the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 in complex with sinefungin, a panMTase inhibitor originally isolated from Streptomyces griseoleus.[17] The structure reveals an overall
fold similar to SARS-CoV nsp10-nsp16, and, importantly, reveals atomic details in how sinefungin
inhibits the nsp16 MTase. This provides the starting point for specific inhibitor design.
Results
To obtain the nsp10-nsp16 protein complex we co-expressed the appropriate genes together in E. coli.
The complex was stable during protein purification suggesting suitability for structural analysis. The
nap10-nsp16 complex was supplemented with the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin and started
crystallization trials. Eventually we obtained crystals that diffracted to 2.4Å resolution. The structure
was solved by molecular replacement and revealed a mixed alpha-beta fold with sinefungin bound in a
central canyon (Figure 2). A central feature of the nps16 MTase is a strip of parallel and anti-parallel βsheets (as they appear in the structure from the nsp10 interface: β4, β3, β2, β6, β7, β9, β8, β1) in the
shape of the letter J which is stabilized from the inside by surrounding helices α3 and α4 and from the
outside by helices α5-α9.

Nsp10 could be divided in two subdomains a helical α-subdomain composed of helices α1-α4 and α6
and a β-subdomain composed of two anti-parallel β-sheets (nsp10 β1 and β2), a short helix α5 and
several coiled-coil regions. A key feature of the nsp10 fold are two zinc binding sites. One is formed by
three cysteine residues (Cys74, Cys77, Cys90) and a histidine residue (His83) and is located between
the helices α2 and α3 and appears to stabilize them in the observed conformation. The other zinc binding
site is formed by four cysteine residues (Cys117, Cys120, Cys128, Cys130) and stabilizes the very Cterminus of the nsp10 protein.

The nsp10-nsp16 dimer interface is 1983 Å2 large and it is formed by the nsp10 helices α2, α3, α4 and
a coiled-coil region connecting helix α1 and the sheet β1 (residues Asn40 to Thr49) and the inner side
of the nsp16 J-motif including sheets β4 and helices α3, α4 and α10 (Figure 3). Nsp10 and nsp16 interact
through a large network of hydrogen bonds often mediated by water molecules (SI Figure 1) or through
hydrophobic interactions. Two residues Val42 and Leu45 of nsp10 are immersed into hydrophobic
pockets formed by helices α3, α4 and α10 of nsp16 (Figure 3F). Nsp10 Val42 is anchored in a nsp16
hydrophobic pocked formed by residues Met41, Val44, Ala73, Val78, and Pro80. Similarly, Leu45 is
anchored in a deep hydrophobic pocket formed by nsp16 residues Pro37, Ile40, Val44, Thr48, Leu244
and Met247. Further on, the main chain of the aforementioned nsp10 Leu45 also participates in two
hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl group of Leu45 hydrogen bonds with Glu87 of nsp16 directly, while the
amine group of the mainchain of Leu45 is connected with residue Thr48 of the nsp16 via water bridge
mediated by hydrogen bonds (SI Figure 1). Among other interactions, a positively charged Lys93 of
nsp10 forms three hydrogen bonds with two water molecules (waters #54 and #170). They bridge nsp16
with further hydrogen bonds with the side chain of nsp10 Thr106 and the main chain carbonyl group of
nsp10 Ala107 and amine group of Ser105 (SI Figure 1). This large and complex interface explains the
observed stability of the nsp10-nsp16 complex.
Electron density for sinefungin was clearly visible upon molecular replacement. Sinefungin is bound in
the SAM binding pocket that is localized in a canyon within nsp16 (Figure 4). The nsp10 adjacent side
is formed by ends of the parallel sheets β2, β3 and β4 and helices α5 and α4. The opposite site of the
ligand binding canyon is formed by the sheet β6 and helices α3 and α6. The ligand binding site could
also be divided into nucleoside and amino acid (methionine) binding pockets. The nucleoside forms
hydrogen bonds with several residues including Asp99, Asn101 and Asp114 while the amino acid part
is recognized by Asn43, Asp130 and Lys170 (Figure 4B). These six residues are absolutely conserved
among SARS-CoV-2, SARS and MERS (SI Figure 2) highlighting the importance of RNA methylation
for coronaviruses.

We were also interested in the possible binding mode of
the RNA substrate. We analyzed the electrostatic surface
potential to reveal a putative RNA binding site. A
positively charged canyon proximal to the SAM binding
pocket could be easily spotted (Figure 5A). To figure out
the orientation of RNA in the binding pocket we took
advantage of the existing structure of human mRNA
(nucleoside-2'-O-)-methyltransferase
that
was
crystallized with a short piece of RNA (PDB code:
4N48).[18] This structure can be superposed with our
structure (SI Figure 3) accurately enough to elucidate the
RNA binding mode. The first nucleoside, 7N-methylated
guanosine is bound in the upper part of the RNA binding
canyon while the second nucleoside is positioned in the
central part of the canyon in a way that its ribose ring gets
in close proximity to the amino group of

the interface of the RNA and SAM binding pockets.
Discussion
Coronaviruses have the longest genome among RNA viruses. The size of the RNA genome is limited
by the (in)stability of the RNA, fidelity of the RdRps, its ability to correct excessive mutations and by
the limited space for nucleic acid within the icosahedral capsid. Every viral enzyme is a potential drug
target because RNA viruses do not have the luxury to encode non-essential accessory proteins. In this
study, we have structurally analyzed SARS-CoV-2 2'-O-ribose methyltransferase, an essential enzyme
involved in RNA cap formation which ensures stability of the viral RNA because non-methylated RNA
located in cytoplasm is prone to degradation and cannot be efficiently translated. Our analysis revealed
overall fold similarity between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complexes (RMSD = 0.747) and
also a high conservation of the SAM binding site among coronavirus, in fact, all the residues that are
involved in ligand-hydrogen bonding are absolutely conserved between SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and
MERS. The co-crystal structure we obtained is, however, not with the natural methyl donor, SAM, but
with the pan-MTase inhibitor sinefungin.
Interestingly, the nps16 MTase is not active without the accessory protein nsp10. The mechanism of
nsp16 activation is elusive because we do not have a structure of any unliganded coronaviral nsp16
protein. Structural analysis of the SARS-CoV nsp10 protein in an unliganded form and in complex with
nsp16 reveals no significant conformational change of the nsp10 upon nsp16 binding.[19] Therefore, it
is expected that nsp10 induces a conformational change in the nsp16 MTase that switches nsp16 in a
productive enzyme. In principle, the nsp10-nsp16 interface is a drug target. However, given the large
area of this interface and complex network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions it is unlikely
that it could be targeted by a small drug-like molecule.
The structure of nsp10-nsp16 complex reveals several important factors that can be exploited to target
the installation of a viral cap on a nascent viral RNA molecule in a therapeutic design. Nsp10 - nsp16
complex must be able to bind the previously introduced methylated GTP, and recognize at least the first

nucleotide of the RNA strand, as well as the substrate for the methylation reaction, SAM. Based on the
position of sinefungin in our structure, it is apparent where both of these two reaction partners bind to
nsp16. These two binding sites form well-defined canyons in the structure of nsp16 as seen in Figure 5.
The binding site for sinefungin must be in direct contact with the 2′-hydroxy group on the first nucleotide
following the introductory methylated GTP moiety. In particular, the chiral amino at C6' of sinefungin
has to be directed towards the RNA cap binding site. Therefore, modifications on this part of the
molecule, based on a rational structural-based design, has led to the preparation of highly active
inhibitors of various methyltransferases as shown previously on various sinefungin-related
derivatives.[20]
Also detailed knowledge of the amino acid moiety on the sinefungin binding site is extremely important
for design of potential SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, since the possible design of specific bioisosteres of
the amino acid scaffold may play a vital role in the development of novel cell permeable compounds as
potential inhibitors of this essential MTase.
We next sought to determine whether an inhibitor of a coronaviral methyltransferase could be potentially
active against flaviviral methyltransferases. We performed a structural alignment of the SARS-CoV-2
MTase and the ZIKV MTase (Figure 6).[21] The structural comparison illustrates that development of
an MTase inhibitor active against both
corona- and flaviviruses is highly unlikely
unless it would be a promiscuous inhibitor
closely resembling the substrate such as
sinefungin. However, two residue pairs are
conserved among corona- and flaviviruses: i)
the Zika Asp114 and CoV-2 Asp131 that
make a hydrogen bond with the adenine base
which is essential for its recognition and ii)
Zika Asp130 and CoV-2 Asp146 that are close
to the methylation reaction center and
important for catalysis. Also, this shows that
there is a significant lipophilic cavity in close
proximity to the adenine nucleobase of
sinefungin in both SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV
MTase. In the case of flavivirus MTases, it has

we believe, that this part of the nsp16 protein
may play a very important role in future design
of novel COVID-19 therapeutics.
In conclusion, we have acquired a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp10-nsp16 complex, the activated
2'-O-methyltransferse, which is essential for RNA capping during the viral cycle. Since this process is
essential for viral survival and replication in cells, it can be targeted by novel chemical compounds based
on this structural information.

Materials and methods
Cloning, protein expression and purification - Artiﬁcial codon optimized genes encoding SARS-CoV2 nsp10 and nsp16 proteins were commercially synthesized (Invitrogen) and cloned in a pSUMO vector
that encodes an N-terminal His8x-SUMO tag. The proteins were expressed and purified using our
standard protocols [22, 23]. Briefly, E. coli Bl21 (DE3) cells were transformed with the expression
vector and grown at 37°C in LB medium supplemented with 25 µM ZnSO4. After OD600 nm reached 0.5,
the protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG to final concentration 300 µM and the protein
was expressed overnight at 18°C. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 20 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 3 mM βmercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation. Next, the
supernatant was incubated with NiNTA agarose (Machery-Nagel), extensively washed with the lysis
buffer and the protein was with lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. The proteins were
dialyzed against lysis buffer and digested with Ulp1 protease at 4°C overnight. The SUMO tag was
removed by a second incubation with the NiNTA agarose. Finally, the proteins were loaded on HiLoad
16/600 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in SEC buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150
mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP). Purified proteins were concentrated to 7 mg/ml and stored in 80°C until needed.
Crystallization and structure refinement - Crystals grew in sitting drops consisting of 300 nl of the
protein and 150 nl of the well solution (200 mM NaCl, 100 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 10% w/v PEG 4000) in
five days. Upon harvest the crystals were cryo-protected in well solution supplemented with 20%
glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the home source. The crystals
diffracted to 2.4 Å and belonged to the trigonal P3121 spacegroup. Data were integrated and scaled
using XDS [24]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement (nps10-nsp16 complex PDB ID
6W4H as the search model) and further refined in Phenix [25] and Coot [26] to good R-factors (Rwork =
18.05% and Rfree = 20.86%) and good geometry as summarized in Table 1.

The crystal structure was deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, www.pdb.org under an accession code 6YZ1.
