Summary

Biotin-labeled molecular probes, comprising specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, would
be helpful in the isolation and characterization of antibodies targeting this recently emerged
pathogen. To develop such probes, we designed constructs incorporating an N-terminal
purification tag, a site-specific protease-cleavage site, the probe region of interest, and a Cterminal sequence targeted by biotin ligase. Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain
as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the
ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5
mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized
for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was
determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities
and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design
coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined
development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in 2019 and rapidly spread, infecting millions,
overwhelming health-care systems, and impacting economies worldwide (Callaway et al., 2020;
Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020). To respond, a global effort has been initiated to develop vaccines
and therapeutic agents. For COVID-19 vaccine development (reviewed in Callaway, 2020), the
trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike – a type 1 fusion machine that facilitates virus-cell entry through
interaction with the ACE2 receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020) – is a lead target, as
antibodies against it can block virus entry (Jiang et al., 2020). Most of the SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibodies so far isolated target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike
protein (Brouwer et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Chi et al., 2020; Ju et al., 2020;
Liu et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Seydoux et al.,
2020; Wang et al., 2020a; Wrapp et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020; Zost et al.,
2020) , but there are other sites in the N-terminal domain and S2 stem domain that have also
been associated with neutralizing activity against other betacoronaviruses (Pallesen et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2018b). Such virus-neutralizing antibodies are sought as therapeutic and
prophylactic agents (Cao et al., 2020; reviewed in Graham et al., 2013; Zhou and Zhao, 2020).
Biotin-labeled molecular probes, comprising the SARS-CoV-2 spike as well as its
discrete domains, can accelerate development of both vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. For
vaccine development, such probes can be used to track humoral responses longitudinally (Liu et
al., 2011; Yongchen et al., 2020) and to quantify elicited responses against spike and its domains,
as correlating such responses with neutralization should provide crucial insight into sites of spike
vulnerability. For antibody identification, probes are used in B cell sorting to identify B cells

encoding antibodies capable of recognizing the spike or particular spike domains as well as
characterization of antibody binding affinities through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or biolayer interferometry (BLI) analyses.
Here we describe the structure-based design of molecular probes, encompassing SARSCoV-2 spike and its domains. We first designed a construct that allowed for tag-based
purification and on-column biotinylation. Next, we incorporated the SARS-CoV-2 spike
ectodomain, with prefusion stabilizing mutations and a C-terminal trimerization motif, which we
expressed, biotinylated, purified, and characterized, including by cryo-EM. Based on the
structure-defined spike-domain organization (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b), we also
created and characterized separate molecular probes comprising the N-terminal domain (NTD),
the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and RBD with spike domain 1 (RBD-SD1). We also used
the structure of RBD with ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b; Yan et al., 2020a) to
define mutations that could inhibit ACE2 interaction, which we incorporated into mutant RBD
probes with ACE2-recognition ablated. Finally, we characterized properties of the devised
probes including degree of biotinylation, antibody-binding specificity, and use in sorting yeast
cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding antibodies or B cells from a COVID-19
convalescent donor. Overall, our findings demonstrate how structure-based design can be used to
develop molecular probes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike.

Results
Strategy for Tag-Based Purification with In-Process Biotinylation
To facilitate purification and biotinylation, we devised a probe construct using the
constant portion of an antibody (Fc) as an N-terminal purification tag. Fc expresses and folds

efficiently and can be effectively captured by protein A resins (Jager et al., 2013). To prevent
intermolecular dimer formation of the Fc-tag, we used a single chain-Fc (scFc) with ‘knob-inhole’ feature (Ridgway et al., 1996), in which a “knob” comprising a protruding tyrosine
(T366Y) was incorporated into the N-terminal-half of the Fc-interface, followed by a 20-residuelinker (GGGGS)4 and a “hole” comprising a recessed threonine (Y407T) was incorporated into
the C-terminal-half Fc-interface [Kabat antibody residue numbering (Johnson and Wu, 2000)]
(Figure 1A).
Between the scFc and the target region of interest (Figure 1B), we added a cleavage site
for the human rhinovirus 3C (HRV3C) protease (Cordingley et al., 1990), a highly specific
protease that recognizes the sequence LEVLFQGP, cleaving after Q and leaving a GP dipeptide
at the start of the target. This allowed us to remove the target protein from the protein A-capture
resin by protease treatment, avoiding low pH elution that is known to alter the conformations of
type 1 fusion machine and could potentially alter the conformation of the probe. After the target
sequence of interest, we incorporated a 10-residue linker followed by a biotin ligase-specific
sequence (10lnQQ-AVI). This construct design enabled capture by protein A and on-column
biotinylation (Figure 1B). As buffers for biotinylation and HRV3C cleavage are compatible, the
entire process of biotinylation, HRV3C cleavage, and purification could in principle be
accomplished with a single column, though we have generally added a polishing size exclusion
chromatography step to ensure size homogeneity.

Molecular Probe of Stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike Trimer with Biotinylation
To obtain a molecular probe of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, we incorporated stabilizing
mutations into the spike target protein residues 14 to 1208 (Wrapp et al., 2020b), replacing

RRAR at the S1/S2 cleavage site with GSAS and KV between domains HR1 and CH with PP
(Figure 2 and Table S1) and adding the T4-phage fibritin trimerization domain (foldon) at the Cterminus (Efimov et al., 1994; Miroshnikov et al., 1998) (this construct is hereafter referred to as
S2P), and expressed it by transient mammalian cell transfection. We observed cleavage by
HRV3C protease to be impeded with the glutathione-S-transferase-tagged, but not the His-tagged
version of the protease, suggesting partial steric constraints on access to the HRV3C site; overall
we could obtain ~0.5 mg of the purified S2P probe per liter cell culture after 24 h incubation at 4
°C with the His-tagged HRV3C.
The protease-liberated probe SARS-CoV-2 S2P ran primarily as a single peak on sizeexclusion chromatography and a major band on SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A, B), appeared
homogeneous by negative-stain EM (Figure 3C), and was recognized by the RBD-binding
antibody CR3022 (Tian et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). We also characterized binding to three
antibodies from a SARS-1 convalescent donor S652: S652-109, which recognizes the RBD,
S652-112, which recognizes an epitope in S2, and S652-118, which recognizes the NTD. All
three of these antibodies bound well to the S2P probe, as did the ACE2 receptor, but not to
soluble CD4 (D1D2-sCD4) or antibody VRC01 (Wu et al., 2010), which bound a control probe
encompassing HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer BG505 DS-SOSIP (Figure 3D). We note that
the IgGs of CR3022, S652-109, S652-118 and S652-S112 showed stronger binding than
corresponding antigen-binding fragment (Fab), potentially due to avidity. All of these properties
suggested the SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe to be a good biological mimic of the prefusion SARSCoV-2 spike ectodomain.

To provide atomic-level insight into the mimicry of spike by probe, we determined the
cryo-EM structure of the biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe (Figures 3E and S3; Table S2).
The cryo-EM grids were frozen with the biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe in PBS at pH 7.4.
We observed two distinct conformations, one with all three RBDs in the “down” position,
displaying C3 symmetry, and the other with one RBD in the “up” position and the other two
RBDs in the “down” position, C1-symmetric. We observed more particles (43,176) in the RBDs
down conformation, which contributed to a 3.45 Å resolution map, whereas the 1 RBD up state
(34,223 particles) 3D reconstruction achieved an overall resolution of 4.00 Å. The two final
atomic models were very similar to published cryo-EM spike-ectodomain structures (Walls et al.,
2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b). The C1-symmetric structure included residues 27-1147, while
residues 27-1152 were modeled for the C3-symmetric structure; in both cases some regions
could not be modeled because of their intrinsic flexibility. Five additional residues at the Cterminal region (1148-1152) were visible in the reconstruction density of the RBDs down
structure, but - similar to published structures (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b) - the Cterminal region of the S2 domain (and in our case the rest of the probe) were not sufficiently
ordered to be modeled. The two structures were similar except for the single RBD that was in the
“up” position in the C1 symmetry structure. Excluding this single RBD, the RMSD was 0.95 Å
between the two probe structures for 2738 aligned Cα atoms.

Molecular Probes Comprising SARS-CoV-2 NTD, RBD and RBD-SD1 Regions
The domain structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike was clearly evident in our cryo-EM
structure and consistent with published accounts (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020b). Based
on these structures, we created constructs incorporating NTD, RBD and RBD-SD1 regions as

separate molecular probes (Figure 4). Transient transfection yield for each of these constructs
was greater than 5 mg/L. Both NTD and RBD eluted as a single peak on size-exclusion
chromatography and exhibited a single band on SDS-PAGE (Figure 5A,B). RBD-SD1 eluted as
two peaks on SEC, a disulfide-bonded dimer and a monomer (Figure 5A,B). We chose the
monomeric form for further studies, as there is no biological basis for a higher association.
Receptor recognition of these domain probes was specific for each construct, with ACE2 binding
to RBD and RBD-SD1 probes, but not the NTD probe (Figure 5C, left). Similarly, antibodies
CR3022 and S652-109 recognized RBD and RBD-SD1, while the S652-112 showed no binding
to these two probes (Figure 5C, right); and antibody S652-118 recognized only the NTD probe.
These results indicate that the truncated domain probes folded properly and retained the native
conformation as on the full-length S2P probe.

Molecular Probes Comprising Specific Knockouts of ACE2 Interaction with RBD
Structural information can define not only domain boundaries, but also biological
interfaces. Based on the structure of the RBD domain with ACE2 (Lan et al., 2020) (Figure 6A),
we designed constructs with ACE2-interface residues mutated to Arg to knockout ACE2 affinity
(Figure 6B). We expressed and purified two double-Arg mutants (RBD-L455RA475R-AVI and
RBD-L455RG496R-AVI) and one triple-Arg mutant (RBD-L455RA475RG502R-AVI). All
three eluted in a single peak on size-exclusion chromatography and exhibited a single band on
SDS-PAGE (Figure 6C,D). All three mutants completely ablated ACE2 binding as designed
(Figure 6E, left). By contrast, CR3022 recognition by all three mutants was mostly retained as
the epitope of CR3022 and ACE2-binding site are located at different locations on RBD; S652109 IgG recognition by the double-Arg mutants was mostly retained and its IgG recognition by

RBD-L455RA475RG502R-AVI was reduced but at detectable level, indicating a potential
epitope overlapping the G502 region. Similar to observations with S2P-AVI, RBD-AVI and
RBD-SD1-AVI, S652-109 Fab recognition by all three mutants was substantially reduced
(Figure 6E, right). Our results indicated that the ACE2-interface-mutant probes can be used to
specifically distinguish antibodies targeting the ACE2-binding site and other epitopes on the
RBD.

Validation of Biotinylated Probes
To assess the molecular probes for their quality and function, we first performed kinetic
analyses of ACE2 receptor and antibodies binding to the probes by SPR (Figure 7A). Purified
biotinylated probes were immobilized on streptavidin sensor chip surface, and ACE2 and
antibodies were in the mobile phase. ACE2 bound the full-length ectodomain probe S2P with a
KD of 46.5 nM, and its affinity to the isolated RBD domain probe was somewhat lower with a
KD of 121 nM. We found the S2P probe to be sensitive to chip regeneration required to remove
antibody, so we used single-cycle kinetics to analyze the interaction with the Fabs of antibodies
CR3022, S652-109, S652-112 and S652-118. These all bound SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe with
high affinity (Figure 7A, top row). Interestingly, the binding on-rates for all three of the
antibodies were comparable, but the off-rates varied. CR3022, an antibody known to bind RBD
but not neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Yuan et al., 2020), bound to SARS-CoV-2 S2P at a
lower affinity than ACE2 (91.4 vs 46.5 nM, respectively), although CR3022 had a higher affinity
to the RBD probe (25.0 nM) than to S2P (91.4 nM). Another RBD-binding non-neutralizing
antibody, S652-109, bound to the RBD and S2P probes at 1.63 and 3.96 nM, respectively.
Antibody S652-112, also non-neutralizing, did not bind NTD or RBD probes (Figure 5C), but

did bind S2P probe with a KD of 0.32 nM, consistent with it being S2 directed. An NTD-specific
antibody, S652-118, which does have some neutralizing capacity, bound NTD and S2P probes at
1.74 and 1.46 nM, respectively. These results confirm that the biotinylated probes have the
binding specificity for the receptor and antibodies and are functioning properly as expected.
We next tested the probes for sorting antigen-specific yeast cells displaying SARS-CoV2 antibodies (Figures 7B, S4 and S5). We expressed antibodies S652-109, S652-112, and S652118 on yeast cell surface. The biotinylated probes, S2P, RBD-SD1 and the ACE2-knockout
triple-Arg mutant RBD-L455RA475RG502R, were freshly labeled with fluorochromes and used
to sort the yeast cells. As expected, the S2P probe recognized all cells expressing S652-109,
S652-112 and S652-118, but not those with the control antibody, whereas the RBD-SD1 probes
recognized only cells expressing S652-109 (Figure 7B and S5). The triple-Arg mutant RBDL455RA475RG502R also recognized S652-109 (Figure S5), consistent with the BLI binding
assay above that showed residual binding was retained (Figure 6E). These results confirm the
utility of the probes for sorting cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike specific antibodies on cell
surface.
Having established the cell-sorting utility of the probes, we next set out to test the probes
in sorting and enriching natively paired VH:VL yeast display libraries of convalescent COVID19 donors for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies (Figures 7C and S6) (Wang et al., 2018a).
Depending on the initial level of antigen-specific antibodies present, just one or two rounds of
sorting and enrichment could increase the antigen-specific cells by several orders of magnitude,
indicating substantial utility of the probes for cell sorting.
To further demonstrate the utility of the probes in sorting of human B cells, we obtained
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patient and

sorted the cells with fluorochrome-labeled probes (Figures 7D and S7). S2P-positive, RBD-SD1positive, and RBD-positive B cells were identified from the convalescent patient PBMCs but not
from pre-pandemic healthy control PBMCs (Figure 7D, left three panels). The double-Arg
mutant RBD-L455RA475R, by contrast, recognized only about 2-fold more B cells than the
control (Figure 7D, far right panel), with only a small proportion of B cells not binding mutant
versus RBD-SD1 (Figure 7D, comparing 3rd and 4th panels).
Overall, the designed probes were found to be functional in SPR and in sorting yeast cells
or B cells with spike-reactive antibodies.

Discussion
Molecular probes comprising key targets such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike and its domains
can be of broad utility. For vaccine development, such probes can be used to define and monitor
the elicited responses, and for antibody characterization, such probes can serve as critical
molecular tags, facilitating the identification of the highly effective antibodies which could be
used for passive therapy (Cao et al., 2020; reviewed in Casadevall et al., 2004; Graham and
Ambrosino, 2015; Walker and Burton, 2018). In diagnostics, they can be employed to assess sera
reactivity and to provide sensitive markers of infection (Perera et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020b;
Zhao et al., 2020). In pathogenesis, they can assist in delineating susceptible cells that virus
might infect or in tracking viral variants, including those that might have selective advantages
(Korber et al., 2020). Here we show how structure-based design coupled to incorporation of (i) a
purification-tag based construct, (ii) a sequence-specific protease, and (iii) a sequence-specific
biotin ligase, enable streamlined probe development.

For probe construction, we used a process incorporating the ‘cut-and-paste’ assembly of
necessary components, employing an N-terminal purification tag and sequence stretches targeted
by sequence-specific enzymes: the HRV3C protease and biotin ligase. Other sequence-specific
cleavage sites such as thrombin could be incorporated, to further control the presence of
components surrounding the target protein of interest. Such protease-specific cleavage, however,
can lead to the addition of residual amino acids at resultant N- and C-termini after protease
cleavage; we note in this context that an N-terminal HRV3C site appends only a dipeptide, GlyPro, to the N-terminus of the liberated target. Importantly, structure of the target protein can
define domain boundaries, allowing for separate probes of specific domains or domain
combinations.
The structure-based methods we describe here for probe construction may allow for the
assessment of immune responses of other type 1 fusion machines. We previously created
hemagglutinin trimer probes with a Y96F mutation (Whittle et al., 2014) and used them to
identify broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza (Joyce et al., 2016). We also created
Ebolavirus trimer probes that could be used to identify protective neutralizing antibodies against
Sudan outbreak Ebolavirus strain (Corti et al., 2016; Gaudinski et al., 2019; Misasi et al., 2016).
And we previously used a biotinylated envelope ‘SOSIP’ probe to identify broadly neutralizing,
fusion peptide-directed antibodies against HIV-1 (Kong et al. Science 2016). Overall, the cutand-paste structure-based design described here should be easily adapted to the streamlined
development of molecular probes against not only these pathogens, but also emerging pathogens,
as shown here for SARS-CoV-2.

approved clinical trial protocol, VRC 200 – ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00067054) and a
healthy control donor from the NIH blood bank pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
PBMCs for experimental sorting of natively paired antibody heavy:light yeast display
libraries were obtained from 2 participants enrolled in the COVID-19 Cohort Study at Columbia
University Irving Medical Center. Participants were both men in their 50’s, hospitalized for
severe respiratory decompensation requiring mechanical ventilation after confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection. Specimens were obtained at 25 days (1605) and 32 days (NYP01) after symptom
onset. Patient samples were collected after obtaining informed consent and appropriate
Institutional Review Board approval (IRB#AAAS9517).

Cell lines
Expi293F and FreeStyle 293-F cells were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The
cells were used directly from the commercial sources following manufacturer suggestions as
described in detail below.

METHOD DETAILS
Construction of expression plasmids for SARS-CoV-2 probes
DNA sequences coding for the SARS-CoV-2 spike or its domains were cloned into a
pVRC8400-based expression vector by GeneImmune. The gene of interest was placed after the
DNA sequence encoding a N-terminus single chain human Fc with knob-in-hole mutations, a
“GGSGGGGSGG” linker and an HRV3C protease cleavage site for purification with protein A
column and on-column cleavage. DNA sequence encoding a C-terminus “GGGLVPQQSG”

linker named10lnQQ and an AVI tag was placed after the gene of interest for biotinylation
(Table S1).
For the scFc-SARS-CoV-2 S2P-AVI construct, the cloned insertion included the spike
protein residues 14 to 1208 with GSAS replacing the RRAR at the S1/S2 cleavage site and
K986P and V987P stabilization mutations, a GSG linker and the T4-phage fibritin trimerization
domain (foldon) as described by Wrapp and colleagues (Wrapp et al., 2020b). For the scFcSARS-CoV-2 NTD-AVI construct, spike gene encoding residues 14-305 was cloned. For the
scFc-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-AVI construct, spike gene encoding residues 329-526 was cloned. For
the scFc-SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1-AVI construct, spike gene encoding residues 319-591 was
cloned. The constructs comprising specific mutations for knocking out ACE2 interaction with
RBD were made by site directed mutagenesis in the scFc=SARS-CoV-2-RBD-AVI plasmid,
either in double Arg substitutions at L455 and A475 (L455RA475R), or at L455 and G496
(L455RG496R), or in triple Arg substitutions at L455, A475, and G502 (L455RA475RG502R).
A model of the 10lnQQ linker and AVI tag was obtained on the PEP-FOLD server (Shen et al.,
2014; Thevenet et al., 2012) to show the location of this C-terminal addition in Figure S1.

Expression and preparation of SARS-CoV-2 probes
Single chain Fc tagged SARS-CoV-2 probes were produced by transient transfection of
293 Freestyle cells as previously described (Wrapp et al., 2020b). One liter of cells was
transfected with 1 mg of SARS-CoV-2 probe plasmid, pre-mixed with 3 ml of Turbo293
transfection reagent. The cells were allowed to grow for 6 days at 120 rpm, 37 °C, and 9 % CO2,
after which the supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and filtered. The cleared supernatant
was incubated with 5ml of PBS-equilibrated Protein A resin for two hours, after which the resin

was then collected and washed with PBS. The captured SARS-CoV-2 probe was then
concurrently biotinylated with 10-80 μg BirA enzyme (~2.5 μg per 10 nmol AVI substrate) and
100 μM biotin, as well as cleaved from the Fc purification tag with 200 μg of HRV3C, which
was prepared as described (Antoniou et al., 2017), in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 50 μM bicine, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM Mg(OAc)2. For RBD and NTD domains, addition of
100 μM DTT in the reaction may facilitate the cleavage but it is optional. After incubation at 4°C
overnight, the cleaved protein was collected, concentrated and applied to a Superdex 200 16/60
gel filtration column equilibrated with PBS. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1
mg/ml.

Expression and preparation of the ACE2 receptor
The human ACE2 (1-620aa) expression plasmid was constructed by placing an HRV3C
cleavage site, a monomeric Fc tag and an 8xHisTag at the 3’-end of the ACE2 gene. After
transient transfection of 293F cells, the cell culture supernatant was harvested 4 days post
transfection and loaded onto a Protein A affinity column. The Fc-tagged protein was eluted with
IgG elution buffer and then dialyzed against PBS before overnight HRV3C digestion at 4 oC.
Cleaved protein was passed over a protein A column to remove the Fc tag. ACE2 from the
protein A column flow through was further purified with a Superdex 200 16/60 column in 5 mM
HEPES, pH7.5 and 150 mM NaCl.

Expression and preparation of antibodies
DNA sequences of antibody heavy and light chain variable regions of antibody CR3022
(Yuan et al., 2020) and of donor S652 antibodies, S652-109, S652-112, and S652-118, were

synthesized and subcloned into the pVRC8400 vector, as described previously (Wu et al., 2011).
Antibody expression was carried out by co-transfection of both heavy and light chain plasmids in
Expi293F cells (Thermo Fisher) using Turbo293 transfection reagent (Speed BioSystems). On
day 6 post transfection, the culture supernatant was harvested and loaded on a protein A column.
After washing with PBS for 3 column volumes, IgG was eluted with an IgG elution buffer
(Pierce) and immediately neutralized by addition of one tenth volume of 1M Tris-HCl pH 8.0.
The Fab fragments were generated by overnight Endoproteinase LysC (New England Biolabs)
digestion at 37oC with a LysC:IgG ratio of 1:2000 (w/w) and passed through a protein A column
to remove uncut IgG and Fc fragments.

Bio-Layer Interferometry
A FortéBio Octet HTX instrument (FortéBio) was used to analyze biotinylation level,
antigenicity, and receptor recognition of the molecular probes. Assays were performed at 30°C in
tilted black 384-well plates (Geiger Bio-One) in PBS + 0.02% Tween20, 0.1% BSA, 0.05%
sodium azide with agitation set to 1,000 rpm. Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (80 μg/ml), NTD
(40 μg/ml), RBD (5 μg/ml), RBD-SD1 (5 μg/ml), RBD-L455RA475R (5 μg/ml), RBDL455RG496R (80 μg/ml), RBD-L455RA475RG502R (15 μg/ml) and HIV Env (20 μg/ml) were
loaded on to streptavidin biosensors for 150 seconds. Binding to biotinylated probes was
measured by dipping immobilized probes into solutions of receptors and antibodies at 500 nM
for 180 seconds. Receptor and antibody binding were assessed in triplicate. Parallel correction to
subtract systematic baseline drift was carried out by subtracting the measurements recorded for a
loaded sensor dipped into buffer only control well. The reference corrected response values are
reported as averages of maximum signal during the association step.

Surface plasmon resonance
SPR binding experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 biosensor, equipped with
either a Series S SA chip for the Fab binding assays, or a Series S CM4 chip immobilized with
NeutrAvidin, for the ACE2 binding assays. All measurements were performed at 25°C in a
running buffer of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20.
Biotinylated spike, RBD, and NTD were captured over independent flow cells at 10001100 RU, 300-500 RU and 260 RU, respectively. ACE2-analyte samples were prepared in
running buffer at a concentration range of 300-1.2nM using a three-fold dilution series. Binding
over the spike and RBD or NTD surfaces as well as over a neutravidin reference surface was
tested for 180s followed by a 300s dissociation phase at 50μL/min. Blank buffer cycles were
performed throughout the experiment by injecting running buffer instead of ACE2 to subtract
systematic noise from the binding signal. The data was processed and fit to 1:1 binding model
using Scrubber 2.0 (BioLogic Software).
To avoid the need for surface regeneration that arises with the low off-rate Fabs, we used
single-cycle kinetics for the Fab binding experiments. Each Fab was tested at analyte
concentrations 180-6.66nM prepared in running buffer using a three-fold dilution series. Binding
over the spike or RBD surface or the NTD surface for S652-118, was monitored for 120s,
followed by a dissociation phase of 120s-900s depending on the interaction. Four blank buffer
single cycles were performed by injecting running buffer instead of Fab to remove systematic
noise from the binding signal. The data was processed and fit to 1:1 single cycle model using the
Scrubber 2.0 (BioLogic Software).

Negative-stain electron microscopy

Purified SARS-CoV-2 S samples were diluted to approximately 0.02 mg/ml with a buffer
containing 10 mM HEPES, pH 7, and 150 mM NaCl. A 4.7-µl drop of the diluted sample was
applied to a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid. The grid was washed with the same
buffer, and adsorbed protein molecules were negatively stained with 0.75% uranyl formate.
Micrographs were collected at a nominal magnification of 100,000x (pixel size: 0.22 nm) using
SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005) on an FEI Tecnai T20 electron microscope operated at 200 kV
and equipped with an Eagle CCD camera. Particles were picked automatically using in-house
written software (Y.T., unpublished). Reference-free 2D classification was performed with
Relion 1.4 (Scheres, 2012).

Cryo-EM data collection and processing
Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike probe was diluted to a final trimer concentration of 0.33
mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4. The sample (2 µL) was applied to a glow-discharged carbon-coated
copper grid (CF 1.2/1.3) and vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV with a wait time of 30 seconds
and a blot time of 3 seconds.
Data were collected using the Leginon software (Suloway et al., 2005) installed on a
Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan K3-BioQuantum
direct detection device. The total dose was fractionated for 3 s over 60 raw frames. Motion
correction, CTF estimation, particle picking and extraction, 2D classification, ab initio model
generation, 3D refinements and local resolution estimation were carried out in cryoSPARC 2.14
(Punjani et al., 2017). The 3D reconstructions were performed using C3 symmetry for the RBDs
down map while C1 symmetry was applied for the 1 RBD up map. Local refinement (beta) with
C1 symmetry was performed on the RBDs down map using a mask focused on the C-terminal

helices, which included the bottom of the S2 subunit spanning from residue 1070 to the C
terminus. The overall resolution was 3.45 Å for the RBDs down map, 4.00 Å for the 1 RBD up
map, and 4.28 Å for the RBDs down local refinement map, confirmed by providing the half
maps to Resolve Cryo EM in Phenix (Adams et al., 2004).

Cryo-EM model fitting
The coordinates of SARS CoV-2 spike ectodomain structures, PDB entries 6VXX and
6VYB (Walls et al., 2020), were employed as initial models for fitting the cryo-EM map of the
RBDs down and the 1 RBD up conformation respectively. In both structures, the RBDs in the
“down” position were modeled using the crystallographic structure of RBD in complex with
CR3022 Fab (PDB entry 6W41) (Yuan et al., 2020) as a template. For the RBD in the “up”
position the map quality did not allow visualization of most side chains which were then
modeled as poly-Ala, consistent with what observed for 6VYB (Walls et al., 2020). Manual and
automated model building were iteratively performed using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004)
and real space refinement in Phenix respectively, in order to accurately fit the coordinates to the
electron density map. Half maps were provided to Resolve Cryo EM tool in Phenix to support
manual model building. EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015) and Molprobity (Davis et al., 2004) were
used to validate geometry and check structure quality at each iteration step. UCSF Chimera
(Pettersen et al., 2004) was used for map-fitting cross correlation calculation (Fit-in-Map tool)
and for figure preparation.

Probe conjugation

Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 spike probes were conjugated using either allophycocyanin
(APC)-, phycoerythrin (PE)-, BV421-, BV711-, or BV786-labeled streptavidin. Reactions were
prepared at a 4:1 molecular ratio of protein to streptavidin, with every monomer labeled. Labeled
streptavidin was added in  increments, with incubations at 4°C (rotating) for 20 minutes in
between each addition.

Monoclonal yeast display analysis
Yeast display analysis using monoclonal yeast were created, expressed and analyzed as
previously published (Wang et al., 2018a). Briefly, VH and VL regions of S652-109, S652-112
and S652-118 were codon optimized for yeast expression, synthesized and cloned into pCTVHVL-K1 or pCT-VHVL-L1 yeast expression vectors (Genscript). Yeast display vectors were
linearized and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AWY101 (MATα AGA1::GAL1-AGA1::URA3
PDI1::GAPDH-PDI1::LEU2 ura3-52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL)
was transformed. Yeast cells were maintained in YPD medium (20 g/l dextrose, 20 g/l peptone,
and 10 g/l yeast extract); after library transformation, yeast cells were maintained in SDCAA
medium (20 g/l dextrose, 6.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base, 5 g/l casamino acids, 8.56 g/l
NaH2PO4·H2O, and 10.2 g/l Na2HPO4·7H2O). Fab display was induced by incubating yeast in
SGDCAA medium (SDCAA with 20 g/l galactose, 2 g/l dextrose). Two days after induction,
1x106 yeast were incubated in staining buffer (phosphate buffered saline + 0.5% BSA + 2mM
EDTA) containing anti-Flag fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (2 µg/mL; clone M2, SigmaAldrich) and the probes for 30 minutes on ice prior to washing 2 times in ice cold staining buffer.
Fab expressing yeast (FLAG+) were analyzed for their capacity to bind to the indicated probes
using a FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences). For single probe stain experiments yeast were incubated

Non-B cells were depleted (EasySep Human B cell enrichment kit w/o CD43 Depletion,
STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and CD27+ antigen-experienced B cells were
isolated by positive magnetic bead separation (CD27 Human Microbeads, Miltenyi Biotec,
Auburn, CA, respectively) (Lagerman et al., 2019). Antigen-experienced B cells were stimulated
in vitro for five days to enhance antibody gene transcription in the presence of Iscove's Modified
Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) (ThermoFisher Scientific, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1 × GlutaMAX, 1 × non-essential amino acids, 1 × sodium pyruvate and 1 ×
penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA) along with 100 units/mL
IL-2 and 50 ng/mL IL-21 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), and were co-cultured with
irradiated 3T3-CD40L fibroblast cells that secrete CD40L to aid B cell expansion. Stimulated B
cells were emulsified in the presence of lysis buffer and magnetic beads for mRNA capture as
previously described (DeKosky et al., 2015). Magnetic beads were collected and re-emulsified in
an overlap-extension RT-PCR emulsion (SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System with
Platinum™ Taq DNA Polymerase, ThermoFisher Scientific, NY, USA) to generate linked
VH:VL amplicons (DeKosky et al., 2013; DeKosky et al., 2015; McDaniel et al., 2016; Wang et
al., 2018a). cDNA was extracted and a nested PCR was performed (Kapa HiFi HotStart PCR Kit,
Kapa Biosystems) to generate ~850-bp VH:VL products for library cloning into yeast display.

100 ng of natively paired cDNA was amplified with primers containing Not1 and AscI restriction
sites for cloning into bidirectional yeast display plasmids (Wang et al., 2018a). Libraries were
transformed for amplification in E. coli, followed by plasmid DNA extraction and subcloning of
a galactose-inducible bidirectional promoter. The resulting native Fab display libraries were cotransformed into electrocompetent AWY101 with AscI/NotI digested pCT vector into yeast cells,
and passaged twice before screening (Wang et al., 2018a). Yeast libraries were cultured in
SGDCAA medium to induce Fab surface-expression at 20°C and 225 rpm for 36 hours prior to
antigen staining. Libraries were stained with an anti-FLAG-FITC monoclonal antibody (clone
M2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and either 20nM of fluorescently labeled S2P or 100nM of
fluorescently labeled NTD or RBD probes, respectively, to isolate antigen binding Fabs. Yeast
cells that were gated for Fab expression and antigen binding and collected via fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) and cultured for 48 hours. Libraries were re-induced and re-stained
for additional rounds of selection and for the analysis of antigen binding after sorting.

PBMC B cell stain
Frozen PBMCs were thawed and immediately stained for viability using the Fixable
Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermofisher). The PBMCs were stained with the following human
surface markers: IgG (G18-145), IgA (S11-8E10), IgM (G20-127), CD8 (RPA-T8), CD3
(OKT3), CD56 (HCD56), CD14 (M5E2), CD27 (O323), CD19 (J3-119), CD38 (HIT2), and
CD20 (2H7), sourced from BD, Biolegend, Beckman, and Miltenyi, as well as SARS-CoV-2
probes (2019 S-2P, RBD, RBD-SD-1, RBD ACE2KO, and NTD) in Brilliant Stain Buffer (BD).
Samples were collected on a BD FACS-ARIA III and analyzed with FlowJo v10.6.1.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analyses for the BLI assessment of probe-antibody binding were
performed using GraphPad Prism. The SPR data were processed and fit to a 1:1 binding model
using Scrubber 2.0 (BioLogic Software).

Figure 1. Strategy for Tag-Based Purification with On-Column Biotinylation
(A) Schematic design of the expression construct of SARS-CoV-2 molecular probes. A single chain human Ig constant
domain (scFc) was added at N terminus to facilitate expression and purification. The AVI tag was placed at the C
terminus after a 10-amino acid linker for biotinylation. The red arrows in the second and fourth Fc domains showed
the “knob-in-hole” mutations to prevent dimerization of the scFc.
(B) Biotinylation and HRV3C digestion. Cell culture supernatant from cells transiently transfected with plasmid was
loaded onto protein A affinity column. Biotinylation and HRV3C cleavage reactions can be carried out in series or
simultaneously, as buffers for both reactions are compatible.

Figure 3. Physical Properties, Antigenic Characteristics, and Cryo-EM Structure of a Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2
S2P Probe
(A) Size exclusion chromatography of the biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe in PBS buffer.
(B) SDS-PAGE of the SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe with and without the reducing agent DTT. Molecular weight marker
(MWM) was run alongside the probe.
(C) Negative stain EM of the SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe. The 2D-class averages were shown below the wide-field raw
EM image in 5-fold magnification.
(D) Biotinylation, antigenicity and receptor recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe. The level of biotinylation was
evaluated by capture of probes at 40 μg/ml onto the streptavidin biosensors. A biotinylated HIV-1 Env stabilized in
prefusion closed conformation by DS-SOSIP mutations and containing the same 10lnQQ-AVI tag at the C-terminus
was used for comparison. Binding was assessed using 80 μg/ml S2P probe, 20 μg/ml HIV Env and receptors, or
antibodies at 500 nM. Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicate measures. Low level non-specific binding
of Fab S652-112 to the HIV-1 Env was observed.
(E) Cryo-EM structures of biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S2P probe. Domains are colored as in Figure 2C sequence. The
C-terminal residues 1153-1208 plus the foldon, 10lnQQ-AVI tag, and biotin were not visible in the electron density.

(A) Size exclusion chromatography of biotinylated NTD, RBD and RBD-SD1 molecular probes.
(B) SDS-PAGE of NTD, RBD and RBD-SD1 molecular probes. RBD-SD1 peak 1 appeared to be partially disulfide
linked, and was therefore removed from further analysis; RBD-SD1 thus refers to the monomeric peak 2.
(C) Receptor binding (left) and antibody binding (right). Both RBD and RBD-SD1 probes bound to the ACE2 receptor
and antibody S652-109 while the NTD probe interacted with antibody S652-118 only. Binding was assessed using
5 μg/ml probe and 500 nM receptor or antibody. Error bars represent standard deviation of triplicate measures. Low
level non-specific binding of S652-112 Fab to RBD and RBD-SD1 was observed.

Figure 6. Molecular Probes Comprising Specific Mutations for Knocking out ACE2 Interaction with RBD
(A) Structural model of the RBD-ACE2 complex, with inset panels highlighting RBD mutations designed to reduce
ACE2 recognition. ACE2 and RBD are shown in cartoon representation and colored blue and cyan, respectively.
Arg mutations are shown in stick representation, with potential clashes with ACE2 highlighted with red discs.
(B) Schematic and sequence of mutant RBD probes with sites mutated to Arg highlighted in magenta.
(C) Size exclusion chromatography of RBDs with mutations altering ACE2 binding.
(D) SDS-PAGE of mutant RBD probes with and without reducing agent as indicated.
(E) Receptor and antibody binding of mutant RBD probes. All the knockout mutations abolished RBD binding to the
ACE2 receptor while retaining binding to both CR3022 and S652-109 antibodies. Binding was assessed using 7.5
μg/ml RBD-L455RA475R, 80μg/ml RBD-L455RG496R, or 15μg/ml RBD-L455RA475RG502R to account for
varying biotinylation levels among the mutants. Receptor or antibodies were at 500 nM. Error bars represent
standard deviation of triplicate measures.

(C) Sorting of yeast cells encoding antibody transcripts from a convalescent COVID-19 donor with S2P, NTD and RBDbased probes.
(D) Sorting of B cells from COVID-19 convalescent PBMCs. (Top row) PBMCs obtained from a SARS-CoV-2-infected
subject 75 days after symptom onset were stained with surface antibodies and probes as outlined in the methods to
allow for identification and specificity-determination of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgG+ and IgA+ B cells. (Bottom
row) PBMCs obtained pre-pandemic from a healthy donor serve as a control for background binding of the probes.
