Abstract
The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a validated antiviral drug target. Several Mpro
inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity,
including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, each containing a reactive warhead
that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. In this study, we report an expedited drug
discovery approach by coupling structure-based design and Ugi four-component (Ugi-4CR)
reaction methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. The most potent compound
23R had cellular antiviral activity similar to covalent inhibitors such as GC376. Our designs were
guided by overlaying the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R), a non-covalent inhibitor
derived from Ug-4CR, with the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + calpain inhibitor
XII/GC376/UAWJ247. Binding site analysis suggests a strategy of extending the P2 and P3
substitutions in ML188 (R) to achieve optimal shape complementary with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Lead optimization led to the discovery of 23R, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV2 viral replication with an IC50 of 0.31 µM and EC50 of 1.27 µM, respectively. The binding and
specificity of 23R to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were confirmed in a thermal shift assay and native mass
spectrometry assay. The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed the P2
biphenyl fits snuggly into the S2 pocket and the benzyl group in the α-methylbenzyl faces
towards the core of the enzyme, occupying a previously unexplored binding site located in
between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study revealed the most potent non-covalent
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date and a novel binding pocket that can be explored for
Mpro inhibitor design.

The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on global economy and public health,
and there is an urgent need for therapeutic interventions. Encouraging progress has been made
in developing mRNA vaccines including the Pfizer BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273. For
small molecule antivirals, the viral polymerase inhibitor remdesivir gained FDA approval on Oct
22nd 2020. The combination therapy of remdesivir with a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor baricitinib
also received the FDA emergency use authorization1. Among the other drug targets being
explored at different stages of preclinical and clinical developments2, the viral main protease
(Mpro), also called 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), is one of the most extensively explored
high profile antiviral drug targets3. Mpro is a cysteine protease encoded in the viral polyprotein as
non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) that cleaves the viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at more than
11 sites. Despite its multiple proteolytic sites, Mpro was shown to have a high substrate
specificity of glutamine at the P1 position4. As such, the majority of the reported Mpro inhibitors
were designed to contain a 2-pyrrolidone at the P1 substitution as a mimetic of the glutamine in
the substrate5. Most advanced Mpro inhibitors including PF-073048146, GC3767,8 and 6j9 all
belong to this category. PF-07304814, an α-hydroxyl ketone prodrug, is being developed by
Pfizer, which has optimal pharmacokinetic properties in humans and recently entered human
clinical trials6. GC376 has in vivo antiviral efficacy in treating cats infected with lethal feline
infectious peritonitis virus10,11. Recently, the GC376 analog 6j was shown to protect mice from
MERS-CoV infection9. These promising results highlight the translational potential of Mpro
inhibitors as potent SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and validate Mpro as an antiviral drug target for
coronaviruses.
Drug discovery is a lengthy process, which involves iterative cycles of design, synthesis,
and pharmacological characterization. In the event of COVID-19 pandemic, an
expedited approach with a fast turnover of this development cycle is highly desired. Using
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a drug target, we report herein a fast-track drug discovery approach

by coupling structure-based drug design and the Ugi four-component reaction (Ugi-4CR)
methodology to the design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors. Specifically, through a screening of a
focused library of protease inhibitors, we recently discovered several non-canonical SARS-CoV2 Mpro inhibitors including boceprevir, and calpain inhibitors II and XII7. These inhibitors differ
from classic Mpro inhibitors such as GC376 in that their P1 substitution does not contain a
glutamine mimetic. The co-crystal structures of calpain inhibitors II and XII with SARS-CoV-2
Mpro revealed a critical hydrogen bond between the methionine side chain from calpain inhibitor
II and pyridinyl substitution from calpain inhibitor XII with the H163 side chain imidazole located
at the S1 pocket8. Similarly, the carbonyl from the pyrrolidone in GC376 also forms a hydrogen
bond with the H163 side chain imidazole7. Given the importance of this hydrogen bond with
H163 for the high affinity binding of inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we hypothesize that noncovalent inhibitors without a reactive warhead targeting the Cys145, but retain the hydrogen
bond capacity with H163 can be designed as potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors. In this study,
we report the structure-based design of non-covalent Mpro inhibitors based on the overlaying
structures of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with existing inhibitors or the peptide
substrate. The design was based on the scaffold of ML188 (R)12, a non-covalent SARS-CoV
Mpro inhibitor, which similarly contains a pyridinyl in the P1 substitution as calpain inhibitor XII.
The overlaying structures revealed a strategy of extending the P2 and P3 substitutions in
ML188 (R) to occupy the extra space in the S2 and S3/S4 pockets of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in order
to increase the binding affinity. The most potent inhibitor from this study 23R showed enzymatic
inhibition and cellular antiviral activity similar to the covalent inhibitor GC376. Its mechanism of
action was characterized in the thermal shift-binding assay, native mass spectrometry binding
assay, and enzyme kinetic studies. An X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex
with 23R was solved, revealing a previously unexplored binding site in between the S2 and S4
pockets. Overall, this study led to the identification of the most potent non-covalent Mpro inhibitor

23R with potent enzymatic inhibition and in vitro cellular antiviral activity with a novel
mechanism of action.

RESULTS
Rational design of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors
Among the non-canonical SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors we recently discovered, calpain
inhibitor XII has an unexpected binding mode showing an inverted conformation in the active
site8 (Fig. 1a). Instead of projecting the norvaline and leucine side chains into the S1 and S2
pockets as one would expect from its chemical structure, the pyridinyl substitution snuggly fits in
the S1 pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with the H163 imidazole (Fig. 1a). This hydrogen
bond is essential, as replacing the pyridine with benzene led to an analog UAWJ257 with a
significant loss of enzymatic inhibition8. Examining the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the PDB database revealed another compound ML188 (R)12, which
shares a similar binding mode with calpain inhibitor XII. ML188 (R) is a non-covalent SARS-CoV
Mpro inhibitor derived from a high-throughput screening hit12. The pyridinyl from ML188 (R)
similarly fits in the S1 pocket and forms a hydrogen bond with the H163 side chain imidazole
(Fig. 1b). In addition, the furyl oxygen and its amide oxygen both form a hydrogen bond with the
G143 main chain amide amine. ML188 (R) was reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV Mpro with an
IC50 value of 1.5 ± 0.3 µM and the SARS-CoV viral replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC50
value of 12.9 µM12. Several follow up studies have been conducted to optimize the enzymatic
inhibition and cellular antiviral activity of this series of compounds, however, no significant
improvement has been made13,14.

complex with ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M). Hydrogen bonds are shown in dashed lines.

The similar binding mode of ML188 (R) with calpain inhibitor XII, coupled with the
convenient synthesis through the one pot Ugi-4CR, inspired us to design non-covalent SARSCoV-2 Mpro inhibitors based on the ML188 (R) scaffold. Specifically, we leverage our
understanding of the Mpro inhibition mechanism based on the X-ray co-crystal structures of
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with multiple inhibitors to guide the lead optimization (Figs. 2a-d)7,8.
Overlaying the X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M) and the
SARS-CoV Mpro H41A mutant + the peptide substrate (PDB: 2Q6G) revealed that the furyl, 4tert-butylphenyl, pyridinyl, and tert-butyl of ML188 (R) fit in the S1’, S2, S1, and S3 pockets
respectively (Figs. 2a and 2d). Therefore, the furyl, 4-tert-butylphenyl, pyridinyl, and tert-butyl
substitutions in ML188 (R) were defined as P1’, P2, P1, and P3, respectively. Next, overlaying
the structure of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + GC376
(PDB: 6WTT) suggested that the tert-butyl at the P3 substitution of ML188 (R) can be extended

to fit in the S4 pocket (Figs. 2b and 2d). Previous structure-activity relationship studies of
GC376 indicate that P4 substitution is important, while P3 substitution does not contribute
significantly to the binding affinity, as it is solvent exposed3,8,9,15. Similarly, the overlaying
structures of SARS-CoV Mpro + ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M) and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro + UAWJ247
(PDB: 6XBH) suggested that the 4-tert-butyl at the P2 substitution of ML188 (R) can be
replaced by phenyl to occupy the extra space in the S2 pocket (Figs. 2c and 2d). Overall, the
design mainly focuses on extending the P2 and P3 substitutions of ML188 (R) to achieve
optimal shape complementarity with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (Fig. 2e). In practice, we adopted a
stepwise optimization procedure in which the P3 and P2 substitutions were optimized
individually in step 1, and then the optimal P2/P3 substitutions were combined in step 2 (Fig. 2e).

Guided by the design rationale elucidated above, a focused library of ML188 analogs were
designed and synthesized (Fig. 3). As the P1’ furyl and P1 pyridinyl both form a critical
hydrogen bond with the Mpro (Figs. 3a-b), the P1’ and P1 substitutions were kept with minimal
variations (Fig. 3c). All designed compounds were synthesized using the one pot Ugi fourcomponent reaction and tested as enantiomer/diastereomer mixtures (Fig. 3c). To circumvent
the need of relying on expansive chiral HPLC column for the separation of enantiomers, we
strategically introduced the chiral isocyanide so that the diastereomer product mixture can be
separated by convenient silica gel column or reverse phase HPLC column purification.

Structure-activity relationship studies of non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors
In total, 39 compounds were synthesized (Figs. 4a-4e) and all compounds were initially
tested as a mixture of enantiomers or diastereomers in the FRET-based enzymatic assay
against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro at 20 µM (Fig. 4f). Compounds showing more than 50% inhibition at
20 µM were further titrated to determine the IC50 values. Next, compounds with IC50 values
lower than 5 µM were selected for cellular cytotoxicity profiling in Vero E6 cells, the cell line
which was used for the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assay. The purpose was to prioritize lead
candidates for the in vitro cellular antiviral assay with infectious SARS-CoV-2. Compounds with

potent enzymatic inhibition (IC50 < 5 µM) but moderate to high cellular cytotoxicity (CC50 < 100
µM) were labeled in red. Compounds with both potent enzymatic inhibition (IC50 < 5 µM) and low
cellular cytotoxicity (CC50 > 100 µM) were labeled in blue (Figs. 4a-4e). As shown in Fig. 4f, the
majority of the designed compounds showed more than 50% inhibition when tested at 20 µM.
Specifically, Fig. 4a lists compounds with P4 variations. As a reference, ML188 (1) (racemic
mixture) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with an IC50 value of 10.96 ± 1.58 µM. It was found that
compounds 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 13 had improved enzymatic inhibition compared to ML188
(1). These results suggest that: a) isopropyl (2), cyclopropyl (3), cyclopentyl (5), cyclohexyl (6),
and phenyl (7 and 8) are the more favorable substitutions at the P3 position than tert-butyl; b)
compound 13 with the (S)-α-methylbenzyl substitution at the P3 position had improved potency,
which suggests that extending the substitutions to the S4 pocket might improve the enzymatic
inhibition (Fig. 2b). Given the advantage of convenient separation of diastereomers over
enantiomers, we therefore decided to fix the P3/P4 substitution as α-methylbenzyl substitution
during the P2 optimization (Fig. 4b). All compounds in Fig. 4b were designed to have extended
substitutions at the 4-position of benzyl to occupy the extra space in the S2 pocket (Fig. 2c).
Consistent with the design hypothesis, several compounds including 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and
23 had significantly improved enzymatic inhibition (IC50 < 3 µM) compared to compound 13.
Replacing the tert-butyl in compound 13 with the bulkier trimethylsilyl led to compound 14 with a
2.9-fold increase in Mpro inhibition. Cyclohexyl (17), thienyl (19), pyrrolyl (20), pyridinyl (21), and
phenyl (23) were found to be the most favorable substitutions at the S2 pocket. Compound 16
with piperidyl substitution had similar potency as compound 13, while compound 15 with O-tert
butyl was less active. Further extending the substitution to benzyl led to compound 22 that was
inactive, suggesting biphenyl might be the largest substitution that can be accommodated at the
S2 pocket.

The P1’ and P1 substitutions (Figs. 4c and 4d) were chosen to retain the critical hydrogen
bonds in ML188 (Fig. 3a). It was found that imidazole (24) was tolerated at the P1’ position (IC50
= 0.96 ± 0.09 µM), followed by isoxazole (25) (IC50 = 2.47 ± 0.27 µM), and oxazole (26) (IC50 =
4.97 ± 0.78 µM). Pyrazine (27) was tolerated at the P1 position (IC50 = 4.93 ± 0.79 µM);
however, pyrimidine (29) and imidazole (30) were not preferred (IC50 > 20 µM).
Next, the above identified favorable P1’, P2, P1, and P3/P4 substitutions were combined
and the designed compounds were shown in Fig. 4e. Compounds 36, 37, and 38 were the most
potent leads with IC50 values of 0.81 ± 0.24, 0.67 ± 0.15, and 0.28 ± 0.07 µM, respectively.
Compound 39 and 40 were also highly active with IC50 values of 1.48 ± 0.56 and 1.05 ± 0.09 µM,
respectively.
Among the active compounds with IC50 value lower than 5 µM, compounds 3, 6, 14, 17, 18,
19, 26, 34, and 36 had moderate to high cellular cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells (Figs. 4a-4e red),
while compounds 5, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 31, 32, 37, 38, 39, and 40 were well tolerated and
the CC50 values were greater than 100 µM.

Given the potent antiviral activity and a high selectivity index of these potent lead
compounds, we then selected compound 23 for further characterization. The two diastereomers
of 23 were separated by reverse phase HPLC (Fig. 5). Both diastereomers were tested in the
FRET-based enzymatic assay. GC376 was included as a positive control. It was found that 23R
is the active diastereomer with an IC50 value of 0.31 ± 0.04 µM, while the 23S diastereomer was
more than 16-fold less active (IC50 = 5.61 ± 0.71 µM) (Table 2). The stereochemistry of 23R was
determined by the co-crystal structure with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as described in the following
section. Compared with the parent compound ML188 (1), the optimized lead 23R had more than
a 35-fold increase in enzymatic inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Compound 23R also
showed comparable potency against SARS-CoV Mpro with an IC50 value of 0.27 ± 0.03 µM.
Neither ML188 (1) nor 23R inhibited the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro) (IC50 > 20 µM)
(Table 2), suggesting the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by 23R is specific.

Next, the antiviral activity of 23R was tested against SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate)
in Vero E6 cells using the immunofluorescence assay. ML188 (1) and GC376 were included as
controls. It was found that compound 23R had an EC50 value of 1.27 µM (Table 2), which was
similar to the antiviral potency of the covalent inhibitor GC376 (EC50 = 1.51 µM). Compound
23R was also not cytotoxic to Vero E6 cells at up to 100 µM. In contrast, the parent compound
ML188 (1) had no detectable antiviral activity when tested at up to 20 µM. To further confirm the

antiviral activity of compound 23R, we performed secondary antiviral assay in the human lung
epithelial Calu-3 cell line, which endogenously expresses TMPRSS2 and is widely used as a
physiological relevant cell line for SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was found that compound 23R
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) replication in Calu-3 cells with an EC50 value of
3.03 µM and it was not cytotoxic at up to 100 µM (Fig. 6). The 2.4-fold difference in antiviral
potency between the Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines might due to differences in cell membrane
permeability or metabolism.

Mechanism of action of 23R in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
The mechanism of action of 23R was characterized using the native mass spectrometry
binding assay, the thermal shift binding assay, and the enzymatic kinetic studies (Fig. 7). In the
native mass spectrometry binding assay, compound 23R showed dose-dependent binding to
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, similar to the positive control GC376, with a binding stoichiometry of one
drug per monomer (Fig. 7a). Similarly, compound 23R showed dose-dependent stabilization of

the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in the thermal shift binding assay with an apparent Kd value of 9.43 µM, a
9.3-fold increase compared to ML188 (1) (Fig. 7b). In the enzymatic kinetic studies, 23R was
shown to be a reversible inhibitor with a Ki value of 0.07 µM (Figs. 7c and 7d top and middle
panels). In comparison, the Ki for the parent compound ML188 (1) is 2.29 µM. The LineweaverBurk or double-reciprocal plot with different compound concentrations yielded an intercept at the
Y-axis, suggesting that 23R is a competitive inhibitor similar to ML188 (1) (Figs. 7c and 7d
bottom panel).

X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R
Using X-ray crystallography, we successfully determined the binding pose of 23R with SARSCoV-2 Mpro at 2.6 Å resolution (Fig. 8a). Electron density reveals the body of 23R extends
throughout the substrate binding channel, with side chains occupying the S1’, S1, S2, and S3
sub-pockets. The binding pose is similar to the previously solved structure of SARS-CoV Mpro
with ML188 (R) (PDB: 3V3M)12, consistent with the similarities between the two compounds and
between the two proteins (Fig. 8b). The furyl moiety of 23R binds to a portion of the P1’ site,
which normally accommodates small hydrophobic residues. While the furylamide carbonyl
group of 23R does not insert into the oxyanion hole, it does form a bifurcated hydrogen bond
with the apical residue of this oxyanion hole, Gly143. However, the furan ring oxygen is likely a
weaker hydrogen bond acceptor than the amide oxygen and it lies outside of the plane of
Gly143’s amide NH. Directly attached to the furylamide moiety is a P2 biphenyl group and a P1
pyridinyl ring. The P2 biphenyl group projects directly into the S2 pocket, which prefers

hydrophobic residues such as leucine and phenylalanine. As expected, the P1 pyridinyl ring
occupies the S1 pocket, which is known for its strict preference for glutamine. While most Mpro
inhibitors bear a pyrrolidinone glutamine mimetic at the P1 position, we determined that more
hydrophobic residues can also bind to the S1 site, and that hydrogen bond formation with
His163 is critical for inhibition8. In this instance, the pyridinyl ring of 23R is nearly
superimposable with the same moiety from calpain inhibitor XII (Fig. 8c) forming a close (2.9 Å)
hydrogen bond with His163. An amide bond connecting the pyridinyl ring to the α-methylbenzyl
moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain of Glu166. The benzyl ring of the αmethylbenzyl moiety is partially positioned both in the S2 and S3 pockets, a novel binding pose
that has not been observed with existing Mpro inhibitors. Normally, a substituent at this position
would be expected to flip away from the enzyme core towards the solvent-exposed S3 pocket,
which explains why P3 substitutions have little to no influence on the enzymatic inhibition4.
However, the hydrophobic nature of the benzyl ring in 23R causes it to project towards the core
near the S2 pocket, forcing Gln189 to rotate outwards (Fig. 8d). This conformation is reinforced
by pi-stacking interactions with the first phenyl of the biphenyl substituent. Notably, the binding
pose of 23R features continuous intramolecular pi-stacking, where the phenyl is sandwiched by
furan and benzyl groups, potentially contributing to its potent inhibition of Mpro. Meanwhile, the
S4 pocket remains largely unoccupied by 23R, leaving room for further improvement. In
summary, the X-ray crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 23R revealed two
interesting structural features: 1) The P2 biphenyl is probably the largest substitution that can be
accommodated in the S2 pocket, which is consistent with our design hypothesis. 2) The benzyl
group from the terminal α-methylbenzyl fits in a previously unexplored binding pocket located in
between the S2 and S4 pockets. As such, the benzyl group faces towards the core of the
enzyme instead of solvent-exposed as seen with other existing Mpro inhibitors. Although this is
unexpected from the design perspective, this novel binding mode suggests that the new binding
pocket in between S2 and S4 that can be explored for inhibitor design.

Discussion
Given the social and economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the need for
effective therapeutics is apparent. Researchers around the globe are racing to come up with
intervention strategies. The viral Mpro is a high profile antiviral drug target and several Mpro
inhibitors are now in animal model studies and human clinical trial6. Among the known Mpro
inhibitors, the majority of them are covalent inhibitors such as GC376 analogs that contain a
pyrollidone in the P1 position as a glutamine mimetic. Several structurally distinct compounds
including ebselen, disulfiram, carmofur, PX-12, tideglusib, and shiknonin were claimed as Mpro
inhibitors16,17, but were later invalidated as promiscuous non-specific cysteine protease
inhibitors18,19. In addition, non-covalent inhibitors such as ML188 (R) were developed and
validated as SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitors5,12. Several follow up studies have been conducted to
optimize the enzymatic potency of this series of compounds against SARS-CoV Mpro and the
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. However, no significant improvement has been made and ML188 (R)
remains the only non-covalent inhibitor with moderate antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (EC50
= 12.9 ± 0.7 µM)13,14. Nevertheless, given the sequence and structure similarities between
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and the common binding mode of ML188 (R) and calpain
inhibitor XII, we hypothesize that ML188 (R) is a promising scaffold for lead optimization. In this
study, we developed an expedited drug discovery approach to the design of non-covalent
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The design was based on the binding pose of calpain inhibitor
XII with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB: 6XFN). The highlights of this study include: 1) The overlaying
X-ray crystal structures with multiple Mpro inhibitors revealed the chemical space that can be
explored for drug design. 2) All designed compounds were synthesized by the one-pot Ugi-4CR,
which greatly facilitated the lead optimization. Indeed, we were able to improve the enzymatic
inhibition potency by 35-fold from a focused library of 39 compounds. This is a significant
advantage compared to covalent inhibitors such as GC376, which involves at least a five-step

synthesis. 3) By introducing the chiral isocyanide, the diastereomer product can be conveniently
separated by either silica gel column or reverse phase HPLC column, bypassing the need for an
expensive chiral HPLC column. This greatly speeds up the co-crystallization. 4) The X-ray
crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 23R reveals a new binding pocket in
between S2 and S4 sites that can be explored for drug design. Overall, using the expedited
drug discovery approach, this study revealed a promising non-covalent Mpro inhibitor 23R with a
confirmed mechanism of action and potent cellular antiviral activity for further development.

Native Mass Spectrometry. Prior to analysis, the protein was buffer exchanged into 0.2 M
ammonium acetate (pH 6.8) and diluted to 10 μM. DTT was dissolved in water and prepared at
a 400 mM stock. Each ligand was dissolved in ethanol and diluted to 10X stock concentrations.
The final mixture was prepared by adding 4 μL protein, 0.5 μL DTT stock, and 0.5 μL ligand
stock for final concentration of 4 mM DTT and 70 μM protein. Final ligand concentrations were
10 µM and 30 µM. The mixtures were then incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature prior
to analysis. Each sample was mixed and analyzed in triplicate.
Native mass spectrometry (MS) was performed using a Q-Exactive HF quadrupole-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer with the Ultra-High Mass Range research modifications (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Samples were ionized using nano-electrospray ionization in positive ion mode using
1.0 kV capillary voltage at a 150 °C capillary temperature. The samples were all analyzed with a
1,000–25,000 m/z range, the resolution set to 30,000, and a trapping gas pressure set to 3.
Between 10 and 50 V of source fragmentation was applied to all samples to aid in desolvation.
Data were deconvolved and analyzed with UniDec.21

at various concentrations was added to each well and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The
enzymatic reaction was initiated by adding 1 µl of 1 mM corresponding FRET substrate (the final
substrate concentration is 10 µM). The reaction was monitored in a Cytation 5 image reader
with filters for excitation at 360/40 nm and emission at 460/40 nm at 30 °C for 1 hr. The initial

For the Morrison plot, 10 µl 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein was added to 190 µl of Mpro
reaction buffer containing testing compound and the FRET substrate, and the reaction was
monitored for 2 hr. The final FRET substrate concentration in this assay is 20 µM. KI was
determined with Morrison equation in Prism 8 as described previously7,8.
For Michealis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots, assay was carried as follows: 50 µl of 50 µM
Mpro protein was added to 50 µl reaction buffer containing testing compound and various
concentrations of FRET substrate to initiate the enzyme reaction. The initial velocity of the
enzymatic reaction with and without testing compounds was calculated by linear regression for
the first 15 min of the kinetic progress curve, the plotted against substrate concentrations in
Prism 8 with Michaelis-Menten equation.

Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The thermal shift binding assay (TSA) was carried
out using a Thermal Fisher QuantStudioTM 5 Real-Time PCR System as described previously7,8.
Briefly, 3 µM SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein in Mpro reaction buffer was incubated with various
concentrations of compound ML188 or 23R at 30 °C for 30 min. 1X SYPRO orange dye was
added and fluorescence of the well was monitored under a temperature gradient range from
20 °C to 90 °C with 0.05 °C/s incremental step. Measured Tm was plotted against compound
concentration with one-site binding function in Prism 8.

Cytotoxicity measurement. Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of compounds were carried out using
the neutral red uptake assay22,23. Briefly, 80,000 cells/mL of the tested cell lines were dispensed
into 96-well cell culture plates at 100 µL/well. Twenty-four hours later, the growth medium was
removed and washed with 150 µL PBS buffer. 200 µL fresh serum-free medium containing
serial diluted compounds was added to each well. After incubating for 5 days at 37 °C, the
medium was removed and replaced with 100 µL DMEM medium containing 40 µg/mL neutral
red and incubated for 2-4 h at 37 °C. The amount of neutral red taken up was determined by
measuring the absorbance at 540 nm using a Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (Fisher
Scientific). The CC50 values were calculated from best-fit dose response curves with variable
slope in Prism 8.
Immunofluorescence assay. Antiviral immunofluorescence assay was carried out as
previously described8. Briefly, Vero E6 cells in 96-well plates (Corning) were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020 isolate) at MOI of 0.05 in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS.
Immediately before the viral inoculation, the tested compounds in a three-fold dilution
concentration series were also added to the wells in triplicate. The infection proceeded for 48 h
without the removal of the viruses or the compounds. The cells were then fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-100, blocked with DMEM containing 10%
FBS, and stained with a rabbit monoclonal antibody against SARS-CoV-2 NP (GeneTex,
GTX635679) and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Hoechst 33342 was added in the final step to counterstain the nuclei.
Fluorescence images of approximately ten thousand cells were acquired per well with a 10x
objective in a Cytation 5 (BioTek). The total number of cells, as indicated by the nuclei staining,
and the fraction of the infected cells, as indicated by the NP staining, were quantified with the
cellular analysis module of the Gen5 software (BioTek).

Antiviral assay in Calu-3 cells. Calu-3 cells (ATCC, HTB-55) grown in Minimal Eagles Medium
supplemented with 0.1% non-essential amino acids, 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS
are plated in 384 well plates. The next day, 50 nL of drug suspended in DMSO is added as an
8-pt dose response with three-fold dilutions between test concentrations in triplicate, starting at
40 µM final concentration. The negative control (DMSO, n=32) and positive control (10 µM
Remdesivir, n=32) are included on each assay plate. Calu3 cells are pretreated with controls
and test drugs (in triplicate) for 2 hours prior to infection. In BSL3 containment, SARS-CoV-2
(isolate USA WA1/2020) diluted in serum free growth medium is added to plates to achieve an
MOI=0.5. Cells are incubated continuously with drugs and SARS-CoV-2 for 48 hours. Cells are
fixed and then immunstained with anti-dsRNA (J2) and nuclei are counterstained with Hoechst
33342 for automated microscopy. Automated image analysis quantifies the number of cells per
well (toxicity) and the percentage of infected cells (dsRNA+ cells/cell number) per well. SARSCoV-2 infection at each drug concentration was normalized to aggregated DMSO plate control
wells and expressed as percentage-of-control (POC=% Infection sample/Avg % Infection DMSO cont).
A non-linear regression curve fit analysis (GraphPad Prism 8) of POC Infection and cell viability
versus the log10 transformed concentration values to calculate IC50 values for Infection and CC50
values for cell viability. Selectivity index (SI) was calculated as a ratio of drug’s CC50 and IC50
values (SI = CC50/IC50).

Mpro crystallization and structure determination. 23R was added to 20 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2
Mpro to a final concentration of 1.75 mM and incubated overnight at 4˚C. This mixture was then
diluted four-fold with protein stock buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) then
spun down at 13,000 × g for 1 min to remove precipitate. Crystals were grown by mixing the
protein-inhibitor sample with an equal volume of crystallization buffer (20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M
NaF) in a vapor diffusion, hanging drop apparatus. Crystals were then transferred to a drop with
crystallization buffer containing 5 mM 23R for 1 h, followed by a brief soaking in a cryoprotectant

solution of 30% PEG 3350 and 15% glycerol with 2 mM 23R. Crystals were then flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen for X-ray diffraction.
X-ray diffraction data for the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structures were collected on the SBC 19-ID
beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Argonne, IL, and processed with the
HKL3000 software suite. The CCP4 versions of MOLREP24 was used for molecular replacement
using a previously solved SARS-CoV-2 Mpro structure, 6YB7. Structural refinement was
performed using REFMAC525 and COOT26. The crystallographic statistics is shown in Table S1.
