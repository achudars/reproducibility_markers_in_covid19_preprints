Abstract

42

The standard dosing of the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine validated in clinical trials

43

includes two doses administered three weeks apart. While the decision by some public health

44

authorities to space the doses because of limiting supply has raised concerns about vaccine

45

efficacy, data indicate that a single dose is up to 90% effective starting 14 days after its

46

administration. We analyzed humoral and T cells responses three weeks after a single dose of

47

this mRNA vaccine. Despite the proven efficacy of the vaccine at this time point, no neutralizing

48

activity were elicited in SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals. However, we detected strong anti-receptor

49

binding domain (RBD) and Spike antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions and cellular

50

responses dominated by the CD4+ T cell component. A single dose of this mRNA vaccine to

51

individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 boosted all humoral and T cell responses

52

measured, with strong correlations between T helper and antibody immunity. Neutralizing

53

responses were increased in both potency and breadth, with distinctive capacity to neutralize

54

emerging variant strains. Our results highlight the importance of vaccinating uninfected and

55

previously-infected individuals and shed new light into the potential role of Fc-mediated effector

56

functions and T cell responses in vaccine efficacy. They also provide support to spacing the doses

57

of two-vaccine regimens to vaccinate a larger pool of the population in the context of vaccine

58

scarcity against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

61

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological

62

agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), responsible for the current pandemic that

63

infected over 120 million people and led to more than 2.66 million deaths worldwide1,2. This

64

pandemic caused a race for the elaboration of an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-23,4.

65

Currently approved vaccines target the highly immunogenic trimeric Spike (S) glycoprotein that

66

facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells via its receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts

67

with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2)5,6. Among these vaccines, four are approved in

68

many countries (Pfizer/BioNtech BNT162b2, Moderna mRNA-1273, AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 and

69

Janssen Ad26.COV2S). The Pfizer/BioNtech BNT162b2 vaccine was developed using a novel

70

technology based on mRNA7. This technology consists in intramuscular injection of a lipid

71

nanoparticle-encapsulated synthetic mRNA vaccine encoding the viral Spike glycoproteins of

72

SARS-CoV-2, which has shown to elicit a robust efficacy against the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, which

73

served as template for their development8,9. This vaccine encodes for a membrane-anchored

74

SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, stabilized in a prefusion conformation by mutating the furin

75

cleavage site and introducing two prolines in the S2 fusion machinery7,10. However, the

76

emergence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein could affect different properties of the

77

virus including affinity for its receptor, resulting in increased infectivity, transmissibility and evasion

78

from humoral responses elicited by natural infection or vaccination11.

79

The D614G Spike mutation appeared very early in the pandemic and is now highly

80

prevalent in all circulating strains12. The B.1.1.7 variant was first identified in the United Kingdom

81

and has been spread rapidly to many countries since its identification. This variant contains

82

several mutations in its S glycoproteins (ΔH69-V70, ΔY144, N501Y, A570D, P681H, T716I,

83

S982A and D1118H) and has increased infectivity13,14. Among the mutations present in the

84

B.1.1.7 strain, the N501Y is also present in many other circulating variants (B.1.351 and P.1) and

3

85

increases the affinity for the ACE-2 receptor15,16. The E484K mutation, is part of the South African

86

B.1.351 variant and is now found in several SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide that spread

87

rapidly17. Studies have shown that this mutation increases affinity of the S glycoprotein for ACE-

88

218 and confers resistance to neutralization mediated by mAbs and plasma from naturally-infected

89

and vaccinated individuals19–22. The S477N mutation confers a higher affinity for the ACE-2

90

receptor and has rapidly spread to many countries in Oceania and Europe23–28. The S477N and

91

N501S mutations are found in several SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Quebec (Laboratoire de Santé

92

Publique du Québec, unpublished data).

93
94

In spite of the proven clinical efficacy of BNT162b2, there are still limitations in the

95

understanding of the protective components of the immune responses elicited by this vaccine.

96

Such protection is mediated through a complex interplay between innate, humoral and cell-

97

mediated immunity29,30. Several reports showed that administration of the mRNA vaccine induced

98

a strong humoral response after two doses, especially against the RBD domain31,32. Robust CD4+

99

and CD8+ memory T cell responses are induced after SARS-CoV-2 infection33,34 and play

100

important roles in resolution of the infection35 including modulating disease severity in humans36

101

and reducing viral load in non-human primates (NHP)37. However, the detection of these specific

102

memory T cells has been poorly studied in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and represent

103

a gap in the understanding of the induced cellular adaptative immune responses which are likely

104

to also play an important role8,38. Among CD4+ T cells, the T follicular helper (Tfh) subset is of

105

particular interest, as it provides help for B cell maturation and development of high affinity

106

antibody responses in the germinal center (GC) of secondary lymphoid organs. Studies have

107

shown that a subset of CXCR5+ in blood, called circulating Tfh (cTfh)39,40 has clonal, phenotypic

108

and functional overlap with GC Tfh and reflect at least in part responses in tissues41,42.

109

Results from phase III clinical trials have shown a vaccine efficacy of >90% starting 14

110

days after the injection of a single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, thus before the

111

administration of a second dose7,9,43. In this report, we characterized the humoral and T cell

112

immune responses in cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 naïve and naturally-infected individuals prior and

113

three weeks after a first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.

115

Results

116

Here we analyzed humoral and cellular responses in blood samples from 16 SARS-CoV-

117

2 naïve donors prior and after vaccination (median [range]: 21 days [16-26 days]). In addition, we

118

examined the same immunological features in 16 individuals that were previously infected around

119

9 months before vaccination (median [range]: 266 days [116-309 days]) and three weeks after

120

vaccination (median [range]: 21 days [17-25 days]). For 11 of these donors, we also longitudinally

121

monitored evolution of the humoral response, from 6 weeks post-symptom onset (PSO, median

122

[range]: 40 days [16-62 days]) to 3 weeks after vaccination. Basic demographic characteristics

123

are summarized in Table 1. In the SARS-CoV-2 naïve group, the average age of donors was 48

124

years old (range: 21-59 years old), and samples were from 3 males and 13 females. In the group

125

of previously-infected individuals, the average age of the donors was 48 years old (range: 23-65

126

years old), and samples were from 8 males and 8 females (Table 1).

127
128

Elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against the full Spike and its receptor binding domain

129

To evaluate vaccine responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and previously-infected individuals,

130

we first measured the presence of RBD-specific antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA) using a previously

131

described enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) RBD assay44–46. As expected, in the SARS-

132

CoV-2 naïve group, we did not observe RBD-specific immunoglobulins (Ig) in samples recovered

133

before vaccination (Figure 1A-D). Three weeks after the first dose, we found a significant increase

134

in the total RBD-specific immunoglobulin levels with the exception of one donor from the SARS-

135

CoV-2 naïve group who didn’t respond to the vaccine at this time-point. With the exception of

136

IgM, vaccination induced similar levels of immunoglobulins (IgA and IgG) targeting the RBD to

137

those present in individuals that were naturally infected 9 months ago (Figure 1A-D). In addition,

138

RBD-specific IgM levels were significantly lower in the vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 naïve group

139

compared to pre-vaccination samples from the previously-infected participants (Figure 1B).

140
141

In the group of individuals that were previously infected, despite a decline in the amount

142

of Ig over time after infection (Figure S1A-D), most donors still had detectable anti-RBD-specific

143

immunoglobulins just before vaccination, especially anti-RBD IgG (Figure 1A-D). For all

144

participants, the first dose of vaccination led to a robust increase in anti-RBD IgG and anti-RBD

145

IgA levels, higher than the first time point measured after the onset of symptoms (16-62 days;

146

median: 40 days) (Figure 1C-D, S1C-D). Vaccination modestly increased the level of RBD-

147

specific IgM (Figure 1B). Among the studied humoral responses, anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralization

148

returned to baseline most promptly, whereas ADCC remained more robust in the convalescent

149

stage while still responding with a significant increase post vaccination (Figure S1E-G).

150
151

To evaluate if vaccine responses were limited to RBD or could be extended to antibodies

152

against the full Spike glycoprotein, we used a cell-based ELISA (CBE) assay to measure levels

153

of antibodies recognizing the native full-length S glycoprotein expressed at the cell surface47. In

154

SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals, the pattern was similar to that observed for the anti-RBD specific

155

response, with a level of total Spike-specific immunoglobulins similar to that observed in

156

previously-infected individuals before vaccination (Figure 1E). As we observed for anti-RBD Abs,

157

vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals elicited higher levels of IgG than IgM or IgA (Figure

158

1F-H). The individual who did not elicit anti-RBD Abs upon vaccination didn’t elicit Abs against

159

other regions of the Spike, with detection levels no higher than our seropositivity threshold level

160

(Figure 1E-H).

161

Thus, vaccination in the SARS-CoV-2 naïve group elicited antibodies against the RBD

162

and full Spike that reached similar levels than in naturally infected individuals 9 months post

163

symptoms onset (Figure 1).

164
165

Recognition of SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants and other Betacoronaviruses

166

SARS-CoV-2 is evolving, and variants of concern are emerging globally. Some harbor

167

specific mutations in Spike that are associated with increased transmissibility and/or immune

168

evasion14,48–51. To evaluate whether a single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine elicits

169

antibodies that are able to recognize a broader spectrum of variants, including Spike with putative

170

escape mutations, we measured the ability of plasma from vaccinated individuals to recognize

171

different Spike variants expressed at the cell surface by flow cytometry, using a method we

172

recently reported44. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing SARS-CoV-2

173

Spikes from the worldwide predominant strain (D614G)52, the B.1.1.7 variant or other individual

174

concerning mutations (E484K, S477N, N501Y) , in parallel with Spike glycoproteins from other

175

Betacoronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1).Transfected cells

176

were stained with plasma samples and incubated with secondary Abs recognizing all Ab isotypes.

177

As expected, none of the SARS-CoV-2 naïve plasma samples obtained before vaccination

178

(baseline) recognized the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (D614G) or any of its variants (Figure 2A-E).

179

However, they were able to recognize Spikes from endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43,

180

HCoV-HKU1) but not Spikes from highly pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV)

181

(Figure 2F-I). In agreement with our CBE results (Figure 1), vaccination elicited antibodies that

182

efficiently recognized the full Spike and all the tested variants (Figure 2A-E), except for the same

183

donor that did not elicit RBD- or Spike-specific Abs. The recognition levels were equivalent to

184

those observed for previously-infected individuals before vaccination. In the latter group, all

185

plasma samples recognized the different Spike variants before vaccination, and the first dose of

186

vaccine led to a significant increase in Spike recognition (Figure 2A-E). When we compared the
7

187

differences in recognition between the SARS-CoV-2 variants, we observed that plasma from

188

vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals recognized the different SARS-CoV-2 variants less

189

efficiently compared to D614G Spike (Figure S2A). Plasma from previously infected individuals

190

recognized all SARS-CoV-2 Spikes before and after vaccination. Vaccination however robustly

191

enhanced recognition in this group, albeit a bit less efficiently for the Spike variants (Figure S2C).

192

We recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits cross-reactive antibodies that can

193

recognize Spike from other human coronaviruses44,45. To evaluate whether vaccination also

194

elicited antibodies able to recognize Spike glycoproteins from other Betacoronaviruses, we

195

evaluated the capacity of the different plasma samples to bind cell-surface expressed Spikes from

196

SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. As shown in Figure 2 (panels F-I),

197

vaccination elicited cross-reactive antibodies in both groups with enhanced recognition of SARS-

198

CoV-1, MERS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 but not HCoV-OC43.

199
200

Functional activities of vaccine-elicited antibodies

201

A single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was shown to be up to 90% efficacious

202

starting two weeks after administration53,43,7. Among the immune responses elicited by the

203

different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, the neutralizing response is thought to be associated with

204

vaccine efficacy7,54,55. To evaluate whether neutralizing responses were elicited within the first

205

three weeks upon vaccine administration, we measured the capacity of plasma samples to

206

neutralize pseudoviral particles carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Briefly, we incubated

207

several dilutions of plasma with pseudoviruses before adding to 293T target cells stably

208

expressing the human ACE-2 receptor, as we reported

209

infectious in this system with SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly B.1.1.7 exhibiting enhanced

210

infectivity (Figure S2D). We observed no neutralizing activity in plasma from vaccinated SARS-

211

CoV-2 naïve individuals (Figure 3A), in agreement with previous findings38. As recently

212

described22,57, we observed that pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were

. All pseudoviruses variants were

44–46,56

213

significantly boosted by a single dose of Spike-encoded mRNA vaccine (Figure 3A). Interestingly,

214

a single dose enlarged the potency of the neutralizing response that was now able to efficiently

215

neutralize pseudoviral particles bearing the B.1.1.7 Spike or from other variants with different

216

concerning mutations (E484K, S477N, N501Y, N501S) (Figure S2E-G). Remarkably it also

217

boosted neutralization activity against pseudoparticles bearing the SARS-CoV-1 Spike (Figure

218

S2H).

219
220

Since no neutralizing activity was detected in SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinated individuals,

221

we decided to measure Fc-mediated effector functions that were also shown to play an important

222

role against SARS-CoV-2 infection58–60. We used a human T-lymphoid cell line resistant to NK

223

cell-mediated cell lysis (CEM.NKr) and stably expressing the full-length S protein on the cell

224

surface (CEM.NKr-Spike) to measure antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). PBMCs

225

from healthy individuals were used as effector cells. ADCC activity was measured by the loss of

226

Spike-expressing GFP+ target cells, as we reported47. In agreement with the lack of Spike-specific

227

antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals did not have detectable ADCC activity prior to

228

vaccination (Figure 3B). The first dose of the vaccine induced a significant increase in ADCC

229

activity, except for one sample, corresponding to the donor who had not developed anti-Spike

230

antibodies. We noted that ADCC activity in vaccinated SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals achieved

231

comparable levels to those of previously-infected individuals before vaccination. Vaccination of

232

this group significantly boosted the ADCC activity (Figure 3B). Based on these results it is

233

tempting to speculate that the generation of antibodies with Fc-mediated effector functions, but

234

without neutralization, might be sufficient to provide a certain level of protection.

235
236

Spike-specific T cell vaccine responses differ between SARS-CoV-2 naïve and previously

237

infected individuals

238

We examined whether prior SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell

239

responses to vaccination. To measure SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific T cells in the two cohorts of

240

naïve persons and individuals with prior infection, we utilized two complementary methodologies,

241

T cell receptor (TCR) dependent activation induced marker (AIM) assays and intracellular

242

cytokine staining (ICS). We performed the cytokine-independent AIM assays as previously

243

described61 with some modifications. We stimulated PBMC for 15h with an overlapping peptide

244

pool spanning the Spike coding sequence and measured upregulation of the markers CD69,

245

CD40L, 4-1BB and OX-40 upon stimulation. We used an AND/OR Boolean combination gating

246

strategy to identify antigen-specific T cell responses (Figure S3A)62. We examined three

247

populations of SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific AIM+ T cells: (i) AIM+ total CD4+ T cells (Figure 4A),

248

(ii) AIM+ circulating memory Tfh (cTfh) cells (Figure 4B) and (iii) AIM+ total CD8+ T cells (Figure

249

4C). We and others have shown that AIM assays can sensitively detect infection- and vaccine-

250

induced cTfh responses63,64, including in SARS CoV-2 infection34.

251

After vaccination, we observed a significant increase in total Spike-specific AIM+CD4+ T

252

cell responses in both groups of participants (Figure 4A) with significantly stronger responses in

253

the prior infection group compared to the naïve group. We observed similar patterns with Spike-

254

specific AIM+ cTfh responses which significantly increased after vaccination in both groups (Figure

255

4B) and stronger in the prior infection group compared to the naïve group. In contrast, there was

256

a significant gain in Spike-specific AIM+ CD8+ T cell responses after vaccination only in the

257

previous infected group. At the post-vaccination time points, AIM+ CD8+ T cell responses were

258

also significantly higher than in the naïve group (Figure 4C). However, the frequencies range of

259

these responses remains significantly lower than that of AIM+ CD4+ T cell responses regardless

260

of the time point studied (Figure S3C).

262

To assess functionality and polarization of the SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific T cell

263

responses, we measured by ICS the cytokines secreted by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response

264

to a 6h stimulation of PBMC with a Spike peptide pool. T cells were analyzed for expression of

265

CD40L, CD107a, interferon (IFN)-γ, Interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-17A and tumor necrosis factor

266

(TNF)-α. IL-17A expression was undetectable for most participants in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell

267

subsets, and CD40L negligible in CD8+ T cells. These subsets were thus not pursued, whereas

268

all other functions were included in further analysis. We defined frequencies of cytokine+ CD4+

269

and CD8+ T cells as percentage of cells positive for one or more cytokines or functional markers

270

(Figure S3B). Consistent with previous results on T cell responses specific for other viruses after

271

natural infection61,63 the magnitude of ICS+ T cells was lower than that of AIM+ T cell responses

272

(Figure S3D-E), but there was a good correlation between both assays (Figure S3F). After

273

vaccination, the ICS+ CD4+ and ICS+ CD8+ T cell responses were significantly increased only in

274

the prior infection group (Figure 4D-E) with stronger responses compared to the naïve group.

275

There were only trends for an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses after this single dose

276

of vaccine in the naïve cohort.

277

To qualitatively assess Spike-specific T cells in naïve and prior infection groups for

278

polyfunctional responses after vaccination, we performed coexpression analysis using Boolean

279

gating and examined each combinations of function (Figure 4F and G). In comparison to naïve

280

individuals, dominant Spike-specific CD4+ T subsets that were preferentially increased by

281

vaccination in prior infection included Spike-specific CD4+ T cells coexpressing CD40L, IFN-γ and

282

TNF-α alone or in combination with other functions (CD107a, IL-2). The frequency of Spike-

283

specific CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-γ or CD107a alone or combined together was also increased

284

in prior infection compared to naïve participants.

286

These data show that while a single dose of mRNA vaccine could induce detectable Spike-

287

specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in most individuals, including Spike-specific cTfh cells,

288

independently of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection status, immunization elicited more robust and

289

functionally skewed responses in participants with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared

290

to naïve people, with preferential expansion of specific functional subsets.

291
292

Relationship between SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific T cell responses and humoral

293

responses

294

Most protective antibody responses are dependent on CD4+ T cell help, which is critical

295

for B cell expansion, affinity maturation and isotype switching. Therefore, we assessed whether

296

pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-Spike-specific CD4+ T cells and cTfh responses were predictive of

297

higher antibody titers and antibody functions, as measured by neutralization capacity and ADCC

298

after vaccination, irrespective of prior infection status (Figure 5A). We observed different patterns

299

of correlations between AIM+ CD4+, AIM+ cTfh and ICS+ CD4+ T cell frequencies measured before

300

vaccination and vaccine-induced antibody responses (Figure 5A). We found that correlations

301

between the function-agnostic AIM+ CD4+ T cell measurements and antibody responses were

302

generally stronger than between ICS+ CD4+ T cell responses and serological measurements

303

(Figure 5A). Notably, the Ig subsets measured after vaccination in the plasma of each participant

304

showed significant positive correlations between pre-existing Spike-specific CD4+ T cell and cTfh

305

responses on the one hand, and anti-Spike IgA and IgG post-vaccination on the other hand

306

(Figure 5C, D, F and G). In contrast, we observed no significant correlations between total Spike-

307

specific CD4+ T cell responses and anti-Spike IgM levels (Figure 5B) and between Spike-specific

308

cTfh responses and anti-Spike IgM levels (Figure 5E). At the functional level, we observed

309

significant correlations between all the pre-vaccination AIM+ Spike-specific memory CD4+ T cells

310

and cTfh with ADCC and neutralization capacity post-immunization (Figure 5A).

311

These results suggest that pre-existing CD4+ T cell responses are beneficial for the

312

generation of specific and effective humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 after a single dose

313

of mRNA vaccine, independently of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.

314
315

Evaluation of vaccine responses

316

Assessing the humoral responses revealed that the vaccine-induced responses (in naïve

317

individuals) show striking similarities with the induced responses upon natural infection. With a

318

few exceptions such as the neutralizing antibody response, at least for the given time points, the

319

induced responses are similar (Figures 1-3). This translates into a similar network of pairwise

320

correlations among all studied parameters when comparing discrete time points before

321

vaccination in infected individuals and post vaccination in naïve individuals (Figure 6). As

322

expected, naïve individuals before vaccination harbor hardly any interrelations between humoral

323

and cellular anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses, which is in line with their overall low and unspecific

324

absolute levels. Notably, when studying the effects of vaccination in previously infected

325

individuals, the pairwise correlations are not getting stronger among our studied parameters, but

326

the network of significant associations is broadened involving more interconnected parameters.

327

It indicates that a heterogeneous boost, in this case a Spike mRNA vaccination boost upon natural

328

infection as prime, brings in new flavors of host responses while diluting others.

329
330

To investigate whether pre-existing humoral responses before vaccination predict the levels of

331

induced/boosted responses upon vaccination, we performed a tandem correlation analysis

332

focusing on pairs of correlations between time points before versus after vaccination (Figure S4).

333

In naïve individuals, as expected, the low and SARS-CoV-2 unspecific responses before

334

vaccination didn’t predict responses induced by vaccination. In contrast, individuals with previous

335

SARS-CoV-2 infection harbor a much broader set of parameters pre-vaccination that predict

336

induced responses post vaccination in the studied data set. Of interest, these correlations differ

Discussion

343

The mRNA vaccines have demonstrated a >90% efficacy starting 14 days after a single dose but

344

the immune correlate of protection after a single dose remains unknown7,9,43. Here we measured

345

several serological and cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve or

346

previously-infected individuals. Surprisingly, despite the proven vaccine efficacy three weeks after

347

vaccination43,53 we observed no neutralizing activity in plasma from SARS-CoV-2 naïve

348

vaccinated individuals. Neutralization is thought to play a central role in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

349

efficacy7,54,55, however, recent observations suggest that they might not be predictive, on their

350

own, of protection65. Affinity maturation through germinal center selection can lead to more potent

351

neutralizing antibody responses. While kinetics may differ according to the antigen used and route

352

of administration, measurable neutralizing titers may take several weeks to develop in humans

353

and NHP after immunization66, and even after neutralization titers begin to decrease, the somatic

354

hypermutation (SHM) process can continue for months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection67. Our

355

results suggest that while the neutralization potency of vaccine-elicited antibodies is being

356

developed, other antibody functions such as Fc-mediated effector functions could contribute to

357

vaccine efficacy early on. Accordingly, three weeks after a single dose we observed strong ADCC

358

but no neutralization activity (Figure 3). Strikingly, vaccination of previously-infected individuals

359

induced a very significant increase of pre-existing humoral immunity including ADCC and

360

neutralization. Neutralization potency was increased enabling neutralization of several variants

361

including the B.1.1.7 variant, Spikes with the E484K mutation and even the phylogenetically more

362

distant SARS-CoV-1.

363
364

We also demonstrated that the patterns of vaccine-induced T cell responses have

365

analogies with those observed for antibody immunity. A single dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine

366

is also capable of generating SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immune responses in both groups of

367

individuals with a dominant CD4+ T cell responses, suggesting efficacy of the priming

368

immunization in generating cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. However, we observed

369

differences in the magnitude and quality of these responses between participants with and without

370

prior infection. Individuals who had already encountered SARS-CoV-2 developed strong Spike-

371

specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, consistent with secondary memory responses to a recall

372

antigen. In contrast, naïve individuals showed significantly weaker Spike-specific CD4+ T cell

373

responses and low to undetectable Spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses by AIM and ICS. Even

374

though pre-vaccination T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein were minimal in

375

almost all naïve participants, it is still possible that the vaccine amplifies preexisting CD4+ cross-

376

reactive T cell responses to endemic human coronaviruses. This suggests that a single dose of

377

mRNA vaccine may be sufficient to elicit robust protective T cell responses in previously infected

378

individuals, naïve persons will likely most benefit from repeat immunization.

379
380

Our results support the parallel use of both AIM and ICS assays for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

381

immunomonitoring. While most clinical trials relied on the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay and/or ICS to

382

measure T cell responses, our data suggest the notion that BNT162b2 and some other SARS-

383

CoV-2 vaccines in advanced clinical evaluation have demonstrated that vaccines for SARS-CoV-

384

2 vaccines preferentially elicit Th1 responses may have to be reconsidered68–71. Indeed, these

385

assays are sensitive for detection of Th1 cytokines and cytotoxic responses, but largely miss other

386

important components of virus-specific cellular immunity. Consistent with this, we found that AIM

387

assays detected vaccine-induced CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in natural infection34. Still, ICS assays

388

were essential to reveal qualitative differences in cellular responses elicited after vaccination in

389

previously infected versus naïve participants. With more proinflammatory and antiviral CD4+ and

390

CD8+ T cell functional profiles in almost all previously-infected individuals, including IFN-γ, TNF-

391

α, and for the CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic functions. Based on current knowledge, we suggest that a

392

balanced humoral and Th1-directed cellular immune response may be important for protection

393

from COVID-19 and the development of effective vaccine-induced immunization.

394
395

Spike-specific CD4+ T cell responses clearly dominated over CD8+ T cell responses, both

396

for AIM and ICS measurements. Because of their role in antigen-specific B cell survival and

397

maturation, we studied the correlation of CD4+ T cell responses with antibody immunity. We found

398

strong positive correlations between Spike-specific AIM+ CD4+ T cell responses measured before

399

vaccination and isotype-switched IgA and IgG antibody responses after vaccination, as well as

400

ADCC and neutralization functions, contrasting with no significant correlations with the

401

unswitched IgM responses. These patterns suggest that pre-existing memory T cell help is a

402

major modulator of humoral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses. While the patterns of predictive

403

associations were overall similar for total AIM+CD4+ T cells and AIM+ cTfh, the correlations were

404

weaker with ICS measurements. Again, this suggests that the widely used ICS assays likely miss

405

CD4+ T cell subsets that are important to sustain the development of vaccine antibody responses.

406

Consistent with our observations on robust cTfh induction by BNT162b2 mRNA, it was shown

407

that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine had a superior capacity, in comparison to rRBD-AddaVax, to

408

elicit potent SARS-CoV-2-specific GC B cell responses after the administration of a single vaccine

409

dose, suggesting that GC B cells and Tfh cells strongly correlated with the production of protective

410

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses72. Our results are also consistent with recent

411

observations in convalescent COVID-19 donors, with reported correlations between antigen-

412

specific CD4+ T cells73 and cTfh cells74 and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. As the CD4 help-

413

dependent development of high affinity antibody responses is a desired outcome after

414

vaccination, our results provide clear rationales for assessing CD4+ T cell responses as part of

415

the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunogenicity and durability of protection, and for

416

including function-agnostic techniques such as the AIM assays.

417
418

The availability of longitudinal sampling with six time points starting from a few weeks post

419

symptoms onset up to three weeks post vaccination enabled us to investigate the predictive

420

capacity of distinct time points in infected/convalescent individuals for vaccine outcome in terms

421

of humoral responses (Figure S5). At the earliest time point, few weeks post symptoms onset, the

422

predictive power of the studied parameters neutralization, ADCC, and ELISA binding responses

423

(IgA, IgG, IgM, and total Ig) were low; however starting time point 2, total Ig, IgG, and ADCC

424

responses gain power to significantly predict stronger IgG responses post vaccination. At the

425

latest time point post symptoms onset, the predictive capacity of IgG and total Ig were partly

426

diluted, but overall broadened, including predictions towards stronger IgA and IgM responses post

427

vaccination.

428
429

We note that vaccination of SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals bring their SARS-CoV-2 specific

430

humoral and T cells responses to similar levels than the ones presented in individuals that were

431

infected around nine months ago. Recent studies showed that natural infection confers up to 80%

432

of protection from re-infection75,76, however whether the same immune responses than those

433

elicited by vaccination confer this protection remains unknown. These results give support to the

434

consideration by various jurisdictions of a widened interval between the first and second dose in

435

the context of vaccine shortage to protect a larger proportion of the population. The United

436

Kingdom has decided to wait up to 12 weeks before administering the second dose of SARS-

437

CoV-2 vaccines77 whereas Canada extended this interval up to 16 weeks78. This is also advocated

438

in the United States in the context of the surging B.1.1.7 variant79. While the duration of a

439

protective immune response elicited by a single dose of mRNA vaccines is unknown, given that

440

memory is a core function of the immune system it is unlikely to decline within these intervals.

441

Nevertheless, addressing this question will be very important as the larger the interval between

Plasmids

557

The plasmids expressing the human coronavirus Spikes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-16,81,

558

HCoV-OC4344 and MERS-CoV82 were previously reported. The HCoV-HKU1 Spike expressing

559

plasmid was purchased from Sino Biological. SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutations were introduced

560

using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The presence of the

561

desired mutations was determined by automated DNA sequencing. The plasmid encoding the

562

Spike of theB.1.1.7 variant was codon-optimized and synthesized by Genscript.

585

incubated with the indicated plasma dilutions (1/50; 1/250; 1/1250; 1/6250; 1/31250) for 1h at

586

37°C and were then added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48h at 37°C. Then, cells

587

were lysed by the addition of 30 µL of passive lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw

624

dataset was tested for statistical normality and this information was used to apply the appropriate

625

(parametric or nonparametric) statistical test. Differences in responses for the same patient before

626

and after vaccination were performed using Wilcoxon matched pair tests. Differences in

627

responses between naïve and previously-infected individuals were measured by Mann-Whitney

628

tests. Differences in responses against the SARS-CoV-2 variants for the same patient were

629

measured by Friedman test. P values < 0.05 were considered significant; significance values are

630

indicated as ∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01, ∗∗∗ p < 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p < 0.0001. Line charts were created with

631

Prism 8.4.3 using normalized data and Akima spline interpolation. For correlations, Spearman’s

632

R correlation coefficient was applied. Statistical tests were two-sided and p<0.05 was considered

633

significant.

Software scripts and visualization

636

Normalized heatmaps were generated using the complexheatmap, tidyverse, and viridis

637

packages in R and RStudio83,84 . Normalizations were done per “Analysis group”, e.g., separately

638

for all neutralization data, T cell responses, etc, except for binding analysis, which was normalized

639

per individual parameter because different antibodies are needed for the detection of IgG, IgM

640

and IgA responses. IDs were grouped and clustered separately according to naïve versus

641

previously-infected individuals, and also according to the time points before vaccination (V0) and

642

after vaccination (V1). Squared correlograms were generated using the corrplot and

643

RColorBrewer packages in program R and RStudio. Edge bundling graphs were generated in

644

undirected mode in R and RStudio using ggraph, igraph, tidyverse, and RColorBrewer packages.

645

Edges are only shown if p < 0.05, and nodes are sized according to the connecting edges’ r

646

values. Nodes are color-coded according to groups of parameters. Area graphs were generated

647

for the display of normalized time series. The plots were created in RawGraphs using

648

DensityDesign interpolation and vertically un-centered values85 . Line charts in overlay were

649

created with Prism 8.4.3 using normalized data per response and Akima spline interpolation.

Supplemental Figure 1. Longitudinal humoral responses in previously-infected SARS-

5

CoV-2 individuals.

6

Serological samples from eleven individuals that were previously infected were collected at

7

different time points after symptoms onset (between 16- and 309-days post-symptoms onset) and

8

three weeks after vaccination37. (A-D) RBD ELISA. Anti-RBD antibody binding was detected using

9

HRP-conjugated (A) anti-human IgM+IgG+IgA (B) anti-human IgM, (C) anti-human IgA, or (D)

10

anti-human IgG. Relative light unit (RLU) values obtained with BSA (negative control) were

11

subtracted and further normalized to the signal obtained with the anti-RBD CR3022 present in

12

each plate, as described in the material and methods section. (E) Neutralizing activity was

13

measured by incubating pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of plasma for 1 h at 37°C before

14

infecting 293T-ACE2 cells. Neutralization half maximal inhibitory serum dilution (ID50) values were

15

determined using a normalized non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. (F)

16

CEM.NKr parental cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with CEM.NKr-Spike cells and were used as

17

target cells. PBMCs from uninfected donors were used as effector cells in a FACS-based ADCC

18

assay. (G) Line charts showing normalized immune responses in overlay over the study period

19

from 293 days before until 25 days post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in individuals with prior SARS-

20

CoV-2 infection. Curves were generated using Monotone X interpolation of data points. Time point

21

D614G. These experiments were repeated three times. Error bars indicate means ± SEM. (E-H)

32

Neutralizing activity was measured by incubating indicated pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of
