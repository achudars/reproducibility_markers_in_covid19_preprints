SUMMARY

29

Improving the standard of clinical care for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a

30

global health priority. Small molecule antivirals like remdesivir (RDV) and biologics such as

31

human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against SARS-

32

CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the efficacy of single agent therapies has

33

not been comprehensively defined over the time course of infection and it is not known if

34

combination RDV/mAb will improve outcomes over single agent therapies. In kinetic studies in

35

a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis model, we show that single-agent therapies exert

36

potent antiviral effects even when initiated relatively late after infection, but their efficacy is

37

diminished as a function of time. RDV and a cocktail of two mAbs in combination provided

38

improved outcomes compared to single agents alone extending the therapeutic window of

39

intervention with less weight loss, decreased virus lung titers, reduced acute lung injury, and

40

improved pulmonary function. Overall, we demonstrate that direct-acting antivirals combined

41

with potent mAb can improve outcomes over single agents alone in animal models of COVID-19

42

thus providing a rationale for the coupling of therapies with disparate modalities to extend the

43

therapeutic window of treatment.

INTRODUCTION
A novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China (Zhou

47

et al., 2020b; Zhu et al., 2020) as the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

48

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 was explosive with ~100 million confirmed cases and >2 million

49

deaths worldwide as of mid-January 2021. Older individuals and individuals with co-morbidities

50

such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are at risk for worse COVID-19

51

clinical outcomes including acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome

52

(ARDS), coagulopathies, kidney damage, cardiac and liver disfunction, admission to the

53

intensive care unit, and death (Chen et al., 2020a; Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Xu et

54

al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). Moreover, long-term COVID-19 symptoms can be debilitating and

55

patients with severe COVID-19 disease can exhibit impaired pulmonary function up to six

56

months post infection (Huang et al., 2021). Therefore, there is a critical need to improve

57

COVID-19 therapies to alleviate disease severity, prevent the most egregious manifestations of

58

pathogenesis, and potentially prevent hospitalization.

59

Remdesivir (RDV, Veklury) is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

60

approved small molecule to treat COVID-19. Prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, RDV

61

showed broad-spectrum activity against highly pathogenic human coronaviruses including

62

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related enzootic viruses, and endemic common-cold causing

63

coronaviruses (CoV) in vitro as well as in various preclinical in vivo models of emerging

64

coronavirus disease (Brown et al., 2019; de Wit et al., 2020; Sheahan et al., 2017; Sheahan et al.,

65

2020a). More recently, RDV was shown to exert potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in

66

vitro (Pruijssers et al., 2020) and therapeutic efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2 rhesus macaque model,

67

which recapitulates mild to moderate respiratory symptomology (Williamson et al., 2020).

68

Collectively, the pre-clinical studies noted above in conjunction with clinical data on RDV

69

administration in healthy volunteers rapidly enabled investigation of RDV in humans with

70

COVID-19 (Humeniuk et al., 2020). In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial

71

(ACTT-1), RDV was shown to shorten recovery time in hospitalized COVID-19 patients by 5

72

days on average as compared to those receiving placebo (Beigel et al., 2020). In contrast, in an

73

open-label, non-placebo-controlled, and non-blinded clinical trial (WHO Solidarity trial) RDV

74

was not shown to improve outcomes in hospitalized patients (2020c). As combinations of RDV

75

with immunomodulators (Baricitinib) have very recently been shown to improve COVID-19

76

outcomes over single-agent treatment (Kalil et al., 2020), it remains unknown whether RDV

77

combinations with antiviral drugs with complementary modalities will yield similarly promising

78

results.

79

Several monoclonal antibodies (mAb) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown

80

to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Jones et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Li et al., 2020a;

81

Li et al., 2020b; Robbiani et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020a; Zost et al., 2020b).

82

Two of the most potent neutralizing mAbs described to date, C144 (IC50 = 2.55 ng/mL) and

83

C135 (IC50 = = 2.98 ng/mL), were isolated from convalescent human patients and target non-

84

overlapping sites on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

85

(Barnes et al., 2020a; Barnes et al., 2020b; Robbiani et al., 2020; Schäfer et al., 2021). C144 can

86

bind to the “down” and “up” RBD positions and has a quaternary epitope that requires contact

87

with two adjacent RBDs, effectively preventing the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike

88

from unfolding and binding ACE2, whereas C135 binds to the RBD outside the ACE2 binding

89

site (Barnes et al., 2020a). Similar to the antiviral efficacy of RDV, monoclonal antibody (mAb)

90

drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in

91

multiple pre-clinical models of viral pathogenesis, and a select few have been authorized for

92

emergency use by the FDA to treat COVID-19 (2020a; Barnes et al., 2020a; Barnes et al., 2020b;

93

Jones et al., 2020; Schäfer et al., 2021). As a result of their early promise in pre-clinical settings,

94

human clinical trials were initiated to examine the therapeutic efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mAbs in

95

infected patients (Chen et al., 2020b; Weinreich et al., 2020). Despite the clear prophylactic

96

benefit of mAbs, the optimal timing of therapeutic mAb treatment is unclear. In fact, a recent

97

study in hospitalized patients with more severe COVID-19 symptoms who received RDV and

98

Ly-CoV555 mAb did not show substantial benefit (2020b). Therefore, it is not known if

99

combination therapy of different antivirals, such as RDV and neutralizing mAbs, in mild or non-

100

severe COVID-19 infections will lead to a more rapid improvement in outpatient settings and

101

early in the course of disease. Thus, a key question in the field is: what is the critical window of

102

intervention with antivirals? The answer is of particular importance, as an understanding of the

103

preferred time to treat with antivirals may help to optimize the benefit of RDV previously shown

104

in recent human clinical trials in hospitalized patients (Beigel et al., 2020).

105

Here, in a robust mouse model of severe SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis (SARS-CoV-2

106

MA10), we define the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of RDV and mAbs used singly and

107

in combination. We show that the prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of RDV or

108

mAb can prevent severe COVID-19 disease symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 MA10-infected mice.

109

Importantly, we show that combination therapy administered at later times during the course of

110

infection improved outcomes compared to either monotherapy thus extending the therapeutic

111

window within which outcomes can be improved. Our data provide the scientific rationale

112

supporting the investigation of RDV and mAb combination therapy in humans with COVID-19.

113
114

RESULTS

115
116

Prophylactic and therapeutic RDV protect against COVID-19 disease in mice.

117

Due to a serum esterase in mice that dramatically reduces RDV stability (carboxyesterase 1c

118

(Ces1c)), we performed all of our RDV efficacy studies in C57BL/6 mice lacking this gene

119

(Ces1c(-/-)) (Sheahan et al., 2017). Although we had previously explored the in vivo efficacy of

120

RDV against SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses (Pruijssers et al., 2020), we had not yet

121

evaluated RDV in mice infected with our recently described mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2

122

(SARS-CoV-2 MA10) (Leist et al., 2020). We initiated twice-daily treatment of mice with a

123

human equivalent dose of RDV (25mg/kg) or vehicle -12 hours prior to infection or +12 (early),

124

24 (mid-late), or 48 (late) hours post infection (hpi) with 1 × 104 particle forming units (PFU) of

125

SARS-CoV-2 MA10. Body weight loss is a crude marker of emerging coronavirus pathogenesis.

126

Unlike the rapid and uniform weight loss observed in mice administered vehicle, body weight

127

loss was prevented with prophylactic RDV treatment (Figure 1A). When initiated after SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.27.428478; this version posted January 28, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

128

CoV-2 infection, only early therapeutic intervention (+12hr) was able to significantly diminish

129

weight loss (Figure 1A). While RDV therapy initiated at 24hr could not prevent weight loss, lung

130

viral load was significantly diminished in this group similar to those receiving prophylaxis (-

131

12hr) or early therapeutic intervention (+12hr) (Figure 1B). Similarly, lung pathological features,

132

such as lung discoloration which is characteristic of severe lung damage observed in the vehicle-

133

treated animals, were diminished in all treatment groups except those where RDV was initiated

134

48hpi (Figure 1C). Lung discoloration is the gross manifestation of various processes of acute

135

lung damage, including but not limited to congestion, edema, and protein exudation. The

136

American Thoracic Society (ATS) created a tool (Matute-Bello lung pathology score) to

137

quantitate the pathological features of ALI in the mouse lung which has recently been employed

138

to describe the pulmonary pathogenesis in BALB/c mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 MA10

139

(Leist et al., 2020; Matute-Bello et al., 2011). Using this tool, three random diseased fields in

140

lung tissue sections per mouse were blindly evaluated by a board-certified pathologist revealing

141

that RDV prophylaxis and therapy at +12 and +24 hpi reduced ALI as compared to vehicle

142

treated animals (Figure 1D). With a complementary histological tool, we similarly scored lung

143

tissue sections for diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) (Figure 1E), the pathological hallmark of ALI

144

(cellular sloughing, necrosis, hyaline membranes, etc.) (Schmidt et al., 2018; Sheahan et al.,

145

2020a) and found these data were consistent with those in Figure 1D. Lastly, pulmonary function

146

was measured daily in a subset of mice per group (N = 4) by whole-body plethysmography

147

(WBP). As shown with the WBP metric PenH, a metric for airway resistance or obstruction

148

(Sheahan et al., 2017), only prophylactic and early therapeutic intervention (+12hpi) with RDV

149

could prevent the loss of pulmonary function observed in the other treatment groups and vehicle.

150

Together, these data show that prophylactic and therapeutic RDV administered prior to peak

151

virus replication in the lung (48hpi) can not only robustly exert an antiviral effect but also can

152

significantly reduce COVID-19 symptomology.

153
154

Prophylactic and therapeutic mAbs reduce SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

155

While the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 has been shown in

156

hamsters and rhesus macaques (2020b; Baum et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020;

157

Schäfer et al., 2021), recent studies reported little benefit in hospitalized patients with advanced

158

COVID-19 disease (2020b; Chen et al., 2020b). In COVID-19 patients with clear onset of

159

symptoms, the turning point in treatment initiation when mAbs lose their therapeutic effect

160

remains unknown. To address this, we determined the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of

161

two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, C144 and C135, singly and in combination in the

162

SARS-CoV-2 MA10 pathogenesis model noted above. We treated C57BL/6 mice with a single

163

dose of single or combination mAb 12hr prior to or 12, 24, or 48hr after infection with 1 × 104

164

PFU of SARS-CoV-2 MA10. Mice treated prophylactically 12 hours before infection with C144

165

alone, C135 alone, or a combination of C144 + C135 were protected against bodyweight loss and

166

lung viral replication measured at day 5 post infection (d5pi) (Figure S1A, Figure S1B, Figure

167

2A, and Figure S2B). Lung pathology as measured by lung discoloration, and two independent

168

lung pathology scoring systems demonstrated complete protection from lung pathology in

169

animals treated with C144 + C135 and in the C135 alone group, whereas negative control HIV

170

mAb treated animals exhibited severe lung pathology (Figure 2C, 2D, 2E and Figure S1C-E, S6).

171

We then evaluated the early (12hpi), mid-late (24hpi), and late (48hpi) therapeutic

172

efficacy of either combinations of these monoclonal antibodies or as single agents in infected

173

mice. Mice that received therapeutic treatment of the C144 + C135 and the mAbs as single

174

agents at 12 and 24hpi were protected against bodyweight loss and lung viral replication

175

compared to mice treated with HIV mAb (Figure 2A, Figure 2B, Figure S2A, S2B, S3A, and

176

S3B). Little protection against bodyweight loss was observed in the 48hpi treatment group

177

(Figure 2A and Figure S4A). In contrast, to the C144 + C135 and to the C135 single agent, mice

178

treated prophylactically and therapeutically at +12, 24, and 48hpi with C144 had low lung viral

179

titer levels (Figure S1B), likely due to a Q493K spike mutation that enabled that mouse-adaption

180

of SARS-CoV-2 and this amino acid residue is important for the binding of C144 (Barnes et al.,

181

2020a; Barnes et al., 2020b; Gaebler et al., 2021; Leist et al., 2020). We also observed treatment

182

initiation time-dependent protection from lung discoloration with the most protection in the C144

183

+ C135 group and little to no benefit in the single agent mAb treatments at 48hpi (Figure 2C,

184

Figures S2C, S3C, S4C, and S6). We again employed the Matute-Bello and DAD lung pathology

185

scoring tools to quantitate ALI in the different therapy groups. We observed the most protection

186

from ALI in the C144 + C135 group early in the course of disease, whereas little to no protection

187

was observed in the single mAb groups at 24 and 48hpi (Figure 2D 2E, Figure S2D, S2E, S3D,

188

S3E, S4D, and S4E). As shown with the WBP metric PenH, prophylactic and early therapeutic

189

intervention (+12hpi) with C144 + C135 fully prevented the loss of pulmonary function

190

compared to vehicle, with some small benefit at 24hpi (Figure 2F). Thus, mAb treatment before

191

peak lung viral replication, which is at 48hpi in this mouse model (Leist et al., 2020),

192

significantly reduces COVID-19 symptomology.

193
194
195
196

Combination RDV and mAb therapy improves multiple outcomes when initiated at 24hpi.
Since treatment with RDV or C144 + C135 mAb treatment failed to improve outcomes
when administered later in infection, we sought to determine if the co-administration of RDV

197

and C144 + C135 could extend the therapeutic window and show clinical benefit where single

198

agents failed. We first performed an efficacy study initiating combination therapy 24hr post

199

infection where both single agents failed to prevent loss of pulmonary function. Here we

200

assessed the following groups: 1) vehicle + HIV mAb (vehicle/control mAb), 2) vehicle + C144

201

+ C135 (vehicle/mAb), 3) RDV + HIV mAb (RDV/control mAb), 4) RDV + C144 + C135

202

(RDV/mAb). While single agents provided some benefit in reducing bodyweight loss, only the

203

RDV/mAb combination consistently reduced weight loss between d4 and d6pi (Figure 3A). By

204

d4pi, RDV/mAb combination-treated group retained the highest % starting bodyweight

205

compared to either the vehicle/control mAb-, the vehicle/mAb-, or RDV/control mAb-treated

206

groups. Both the vehicle/mAb- and RDV/control mAb-treated groups showed improvement at

207

d4-7pi compared to the vehicle/control mAb-treated group albeit it was not as robust as the

208

RDV/mAb combination-treated group (Figure 3A). Forty percent of vehicle/control mAb treated

209

animals succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 disease whereas all other groups survived throughout the

210

experiment (Figure 3B). While we observed some protection against lung discoloration in both

211

the vehicle/mAb- and RDV/control mAb-treated groups, we observed the lowest lung

212

discoloration in the RDV/mAb combination-treated group (Figure 3C). WBP metric PenH

213

showed that RDV/mAb combination-treated group had marked improvement in pulmonary

214

function by d3pi and through d5pi (Figure 3E). Notably, we did not observe a significant

215

improvement in pulmonary function in the 24hpi RDV alone-treated group (Figure 1F) and did

216

not observe an improvement in pulmonary function until d5pi in the 24hpi C144 + C135-treated

217

group (Figure 2F). In summary, the combination of RDV with mAbs leads to improvement in

218

metrics of COVID-19 disease in this stringent SARS-CoV-2 mouse pathogenesis model.

220

Combination RDV/mAb cocktail extends the therapeutic window over single agent therapy

221

As RDV/mAb combination therapy exerted notable improvements in outcomes when

222

initiating treatment 24hpi, we sought to determine if this regimen could improve outcomes at

223

later times. In studies similar to the design in Figure 3, we initiated treatment 36hr after infection

224

with 1 × 104 PFU SARS-CoV-2 MA10 in C57BL/6 (Ces1c (-/-)) mice. Notably, we observed the

225

most significant benefit in groups that received RDV/mAb combination. RDV/mAb

226

combination-treated groups had the most significant protection against bodyweight loss on 4dpi

227

and 5dpi compared to the vehicle/control mAb group (Figure 4A). By 3dpi, only the

228

RDV/control mAb and RDV/mAb-treated groups had lower lung viral titers compared to the

229

vehicle/control mAb-treated group (Figure 4B). While a few of the RDV/control mAb-treated

230

mice had measurable virus in the lung on 5dpi, virus was not detected in lung tissue from mice

231

treated with vehicle/mAb or RDV/mAb (Figure 4C). Remarkably, the RDV/mAb combination

232

group also exhibited the lowest lung discoloration and lung pathology, the Matute-Bello and

233

DAD lung pathology scoring tools, compared to the vehicle/mAb- and RDV/control mAb-treated

234

groups (Figure 4D, 4E, 4F). Finally, the treatment with RDV/mAb reduced the loss of pulmonary

235

function 3 to 5dpi as compared to vehicle/control mAb treatment (Figure 4G). Altogether, our

236

findings demonstrate that the combination of two direct antivirals, RDV and potent neutralizing

237

mAbs, can extend the window of intervention and lead to improved disease symptoms of

238

COVID-19 in a robust animal model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

DISCUSSION
RDV is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug and has therapeutic efficacy against multiple
emerging CoVs in various pre-clinical models (Agostini et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2019; de Wit

et al., 2020; Sheahan et al., 2017). In addition to the in vitro activity of RDV against SARS-CoV-

244

2 in early 2020 (Pruijssers et al., 2020), RDV can exert an antiviral effect and diminish SARS-

245

CoV-2 disease in rhesus macaques which develop mild respiratory disease (Williamson et al.,

246

2020). This study offers the first evaluation of RDV against SARS-CoV-2 in a stringent animal

247

model of SARS-CoV-2 disease that recapitulates several aspects of severe human COVID-19.

248

Importantly, the robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 disease described herein is consistent

with the antiviral effect of RDV against related coronaviruses.

250

Similar to the efficacy results in pre-clinical models (Jones et al., 2020), neutralizing

251

monoclonal antibody treatment with LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016 in outpatients with mild or

252

moderate COVID-19 led to a significant reduction in viral load in load in nasopharyngeal swabs

253

(Gottlieb et al., 2021). In agreement, a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron,

254

REGN-COV2, also showed a reduction in viral load in outpatients (Weinreich et al., 2020).

255

Given the early promise of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in outpatient settings, the FDA

256

issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Eli Lilly’s LY-CoV555 for use in recently

257

diagnosed patients with mild COVID-19 disease symptoms and who are at risk for progressing to

258

severe disease (2020a). However, hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19 disease treated

259

with LY-CoV555 and RDV did not have measurably improved clinical outcomes compared to

260

patients that received the standard of care (2020b). It should also be noted that the failure of LY-

261

CoV555 administered late in the course of COVID-19 is similar to the late failures of antivirals

262

reported in the setting of the influenza antivirals, such as Tamiflu, in hospitalized patients

263

(Muthuri et al., 2014), in that early antiviral intervention offers the most clinical benefit. Like

264

mouse-adapted models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the replication kinetics of mouse-

265

adapted SARS-CoV-2 MA10 in mice is compressed as compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 in

266

humans with peak virus replication occurring in the mouse at 48 hours post infection (Leist et al.,

267

2020). In contrast, the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways of infected humans is

268

more variable with reports estimating peak replication within the first week after the onset of

269

symptoms (Liu et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). Moreover, human patients can shed viral RNA

270

in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract as long as 24 days post infection (Zhou et al., 2020a),

271

underlining that humans sustain viral replication and symptoms of COVID-19 longer than mice.

272

Thus, the window within which to intervene with antiviral therapy prior to the peak of virus

273

replication in humans is dramatically different than in a mouse (~2 days). This is supported by

274

the fact that neither RDV nor mAb therapy could improve outcomes if administered concurrent

275

with peak replication in the mouse lung. Moreover, our mouse model data is in step with the

276

clinical trial findings of RDV and mAbs in that antiviral activity performance and clinical

277

outcomes are improved with earlier treatment with RDV or mAbs.

278

SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations can be selected by single mAb therapies but are less likely

279

to arise in the setting of combinations of monoclonal antibodies with distinct epitope specificities

280

(Weisblum et al., 2020). As SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, mutations may arise in spike that

281

alter mAb binding epitopes and diminish their therapeutic potential. With the emergence of spike

282

variants that contain mutations K417N, Y453F, S477R, N501Y, D614G, and R683G and the

283

increased resistance of these variants to mAbs (Wang et al., 2021), the use of RDV/mAb will be

284

critically important to avoid further selection of escape variants and for a more potent antiviral

285

therapy. Furthermore, the use of RDV/mAb combination therapy could also be deployed in the

286

settings of immunocompromised patients with prolonged viral shedding (Choi et al., 2020) as

287

well as in settings where the virus may develop mutations in the RNA-dependent RNA

288

polymerase that modulate resistance to RDV therapy (Martinot et al., 2020). Thus, in the context

289

of monotherapy, the combination of a polymerase-targeting drug like RDV used in combination

290

with either a single mAb or a two-mAb cocktail may be a more effective tool to prevent the

291

selection of variants that are resistant to monotherapies. Combination therapies comprised of

292

antivirals with disparate and complementary mechanisms of action, like RDV and mAbs, has the

293

potential to improve outcomes if given early enough in the disease course even if circulating

294

strains carry mutations that may negatively impact one component of the regimen.

295

Although our study demonstrates that the combination of RDV and mAbs lead to more

296

rapid recovery from disease in mice, a clear downside is that both RDV and mAbs are generally

297

administered as intravenous treatments which is not a practical method for broad human

298

distribution. Potential strategies to allow the wider dissemination of treatment may include

299

subcutaneous or intramuscular administration of mAbs, which may aid in the more rapid

300

distribution of antiviral treatments in an outpatient setting that can protect against SARS-CoV-2

301

acquisition. Given the improved efficacy of RDV/mAb combination therapy, it will also be

302

critical to develop next-generation antivirals that can be administered orally, which could be

303

more easily combined with mAbs in an outpatient setting, potentially to complement other oral

304

direct-acting antivirals (Sheahan et al., 2020b). As coronaviruses have consistently emerged in

305

the last two decades, and genetically distinct and pathogenic coronaviruses are likely to continue

306

to emerge, refining combination therapies, such as oral antivirals and combinations of mAbs,

307

will better prepare us to combat future coronavirus outbreaks. Altogether, our findings provide

308

the rationale that the combination of broadly neutralizing mAbs against Sarbecoviruses in

309

combination with broad-acting antivirals may be a useful strategy to mitigate future outbreaks

310

with emerging coronaviruses. Our results demonstrate that RDV and neutralizing mAb

311

treatments late in infection offer little benefit in the SARS-CoV-2 mouse model and with regard

to therapeutic use in humans raise the hypotheses that 1) early treatment with direct antivirals

313

and 2) combination therapy with direct-acting antivirals in the early course of COVID-19 will

Animals and virus infections
Twenty-week-old male and female Ces1c (-/-) on a B6 background (C57BL/6J: Jackson

330

Laboratory # 014096) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory. A mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2

331

virus (MA10) was used in all experiments and this virus was previously described (Leist et al.,

332

2020). Briefly, mutations predictive of increased affinity to mouse ACE2 were introduced into a

333

SARS-CoV-2 virus plasmid system and the virus was recovered by reverse genetics (Dinnon et

334

al., 2020). This modified virus was then serially passaged in aged BALBc mice (Envigo #047)

Lung pathology scoring
Acute lung injury was quantified via two separate lung pathology scoring scales: Matute-

393

Bello and Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) scoring systems. Analyses and scoring were

394

performed by a Board Certified Veterinary Pathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups

395

as described previously (Sheahan et al., 2020a). Lung pathology slides were read and scored at

396

600X total magnification.

397

The lung injury scoring system used is from the American Thoracic Society (Matute-

398

Bello) in order to help quantitate histological features of ALI observed in mouse models to relate

399

this injury to human settings. In a blinded manner, three random fields of lung tissue were

400

chosen and scored for the following: (A) neutrophils in the alveolar space (none = 0, 1–5 cells =

401

1, > 5 cells = 2), (B) neutrophils in the interstitial septae (none = 0, 1–5 cells = 1, > 5 cells = 2),

402

(C) hyaline membranes (none = 0, one membrane = 1, > 1 membrane = 2), (D) Proteinaceous

403

debris in air spaces (none = 0, one instance = 1, > 1 instance = 2), (E) alveolar septal thickening

404

(< 2x mock thickness = 0, 2–4x mock thickness = 1, > 4x mock thickness = 2). To obtain a lung

405

injury score per field, A–E scores were put into the following formula score = [(20x A) + (14 x

406

B) + (7 x C) + (7 x D) + (2 x E)]/100. This formula contains multipliers that assign varying

407

levels of importance for each phenotype of the disease state. The scores for the three fields per

408

mouse were averaged to obtain a final score ranging from 0 to and including 1.

409

The second histology scoring scale to quantify acute lung injury was adopted from a lung

410

pathology scoring system from lung RSV infection in mice (Schmidt et al., 2018). This lung

411

histology scoring scale measures diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Similar to the implementation

412

of the ATS histology scoring scale, three random fields of lung tissue were scored for the

413

following in a blinded manner: 1= absence of cellular sloughing and necrosis, 2=Uncommon

414

solitary cell sloughing and necrosis (1–2 foci/field), 3=multifocal (3+foci) cellular sloughing and

415

necrosis with uncommon septal wall hyalinization, or 4=multifocal ( >75% of field) cellular

416

sloughing and necrosis with common and/or prominent hyaline membranes. The scores for the

417

three fields per mouse were averaged to get a final DAD score per mouse. The microscope

418

images were generated using an Olympus Bx43 light microscope and CellSense Entry v3.1

419

software.
