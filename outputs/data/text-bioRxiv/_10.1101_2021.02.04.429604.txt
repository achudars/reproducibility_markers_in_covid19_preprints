Abstract

24

The current COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

25

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus contains a single

26

linear RNA segment that serves as a template for transcription and replication, leading to the

27

synthesis of positive and negative-stranded viral RNA (vRNA) in infected cells. Tools to

28

visualize viral RNA directly in infected cells are critical to analyze its replication cycle, screen for

29

therapeutic molecules or study infections in human tissue. Here, we report the design, validation

30

and initial application of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes to visualize positive or

31

negative RNA of SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaFISH). We demonstrate sensitive visualization of vRNA

32

in African green monkey and several human cell lines, in patient samples and human tissue. We

33

further demonstrate the adaptation of CoronaFISH probes to electron microscopy (EM). We

34

provide all required oligonucleotide sequences, source code to design the probes, and a

35

detailed protocol. We hope that CoronaFISH will complement existing techniques for research

36

on SARS-CoV-2 biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology, drug screening and diagnostics.

Introduction

39

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged by the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, and led to

40

more than 100 million infections and over 2.1 million deaths (Johns Hopkins University

41

Dashboard). Its causative agent, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

42

2), is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Upon infection, viral replication

43

occurs in the host cell’s cytoplasm, which is massively reorganized (V’kovski et al, 2020). The

44

genomic positive-strand viral RNA serves as a template for transcription and replication. The

45

virus synthesizes its own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to generate negative-sense

46

RNA replication intermediates. This negative strand acts as template for replication of new full-

47

length positive-stranded RNA genomes and for transcription of several smaller, subgenomic

48

positive-stranded RNAs (sgRNAs). These sgRNAs are then used to synthesize all other viral

49

proteins in spatially confined replication complexes. Mature virions are exocytosed and released

50

from the infected host cell. Despite recent progress, many aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 viral

51

replication cycle, including the subcellular location of viral RNA synthesis, are still not fully

52

understood and under active investigation (V’kovski et al, 2020).

53
54

Several established techniques allow studying SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with its host.

55

Immunofluorescence (IF) permits the visualization of viral and host proteins in the spatial

56

context of a single cell. However, the development of specific antibodies against novel viruses is

57

time- and cost-intensive, especially if specificity over other closely related viruses is required.

58

Further, the presence in cells of structural viral proteins, such as the Spike protein, does not

59

necessarily imply active viral replication (Cheung et al, 2005; Tang et al, 2020) and their

60

subcellular localization may not reflect that of the vRNA strands. Other molecular methods, such

61

as RT-PCR, provide an accurate, quantitative readout of viral load and replication dynamics, but

62

are bulk measurements over large cell populations that mask variability between cells and

63

provide no information about the subcellular localization of the virus. RNAseq permits a

64

complete view of the transcriptome of both the host and virus, including in single cells, albeit

65

again without spatial information (Kim et al, 2020; Bost et al, 2020).

66
67

Unlike immunostaining, PCR or sequencing methods, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

68

offers the capacity to directly and specifically visualize viral RNA in single cells (Raj et al, 2008;

69

Itzkovitz & van Oudenaarden, 2011; Mueller et al, 2013). In RNA-FISH, single RNA molecules

70

are typically targeted with 10–50 fluorescently labeled probes consisting of short (20-30

71

nucleotides), custom synthesized oligonucleotides with bioinformatically designed sequences.

72

Individual RNAs are subsequently visible as bright, diffraction-limited spots under a microscope,

73

and can be detected with appropriate image analysis methods (Raj et al, 2008; Mueller et al,

74

2013). We recently introduced smiFISH (Tsanov et al, 2016), an inexpensive variant of this

75

approach that has been used in biological samples ranging from single-cell organisms such as

76

bacteria and yeast to whole tissue sections and organs (Trcek et al, 2012; Wu et al, 2018;

77

Wang, 2019; Chen et al, 2016; Skinner et al, 2013), and is ideally suited to visualize RNA

78

viruses and study their subcellular localization and kinetics in host cells (King et al, 2018;

79

Rensen et al, 2020).

80
81

In this study, we designed and validated smiFISH probes against the positive and negative RNA

82

strands of SARS-CoV-2 (CoronaFISH). We demonstrate highly specific viral detection in cell

83

culture, in patient isolates, and in tissue samples. We further demonstrate the flexibility of these

84

probes by adapting them for electron microscopy in situ hybridization (EM-ISH). CoronaFISH

85

provides a flexible, cost-efficient and versatile platform for studying SARS-CoV-2 replication at

86

the level of single cells in culture or in tissue, and can potentially be employed for drug

87

screening and diagnosis.

Results

89

Design of probes specific for SARS-CoV-2

90

Our RNA-FISH approach employs two types of bioinformatically designed DNA oligonucleotides

91

(oligos) (Tsanov et al, 2016): (i) unlabeled primary oligos consisting of two parts: a specific

92

sequence complementary to a selected subregion of the target RNA and a readout sequence

93

that is identical among all primary oligos (FLAP sequence), (ii) a fluorescently labeled

94

secondary oligo complementary to the FLAP sequence, allowing visualization by light

95

microscopy. These oligos are hybridized to each other in vitro before their use for cellular

96

imaging (Fig 1a).

97
98

A cell infected by SARS-CoV-2 can contain the incoming positive strand, the negative-strand

99

replication intermediate, as well as replicated full-length and sub-genomic positive-strand RNA

100

molecules (Fig 1b). We designed two sets of 96 probes, one against the positive strand, and

101

one against the negative strand of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1c). For more details on the probe design

102

workflow,

103

(https://github.com/muellerflorian/corona-fish). In brief, we identified an initial list of more than

104

600 potential probe sequences with our previously described method Oligostan (Tsanov et al,

105

2016). We then further screened these probes to be robust to known genomic variations of

106

SARS-CoV-2 (as of April 2020), while removing probes with affinity to other known β-

107

coronaviruses or viruses frequently causing similar respiratory diseases in human such as

108

Influenza. Lastly, we removed probes overlapping with the transcriptome of several relevant

109

host organisms (human, mouse, African green monkey, hamster and ferret). To establish the

110

final list of 96 probes (Fig 1c), we chose probes targeting regions with the highest NGS

111

coverage. The complete list of probe sequences is provided in Supplementary Table S1.

112

Visualization of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with CoronaFISH

113

To test our probes, we first used Vero cells (African green monkey), which are known to be

114

permissive for SARS-CoV-2 replication (Takayama, 2020) (see Methods). We processed the

115

samples for FISH following the protocol detailed in Supplementary Note 1 and imaged cells

116

18h post infection (p.i.) with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2, as well as uninfected control

117

cells. The positive-strand and negative-strand probe-sets were both labeled with the fluorophore

118

Cy3 and imaged separately in distinct experiments.

119
120

In uninfected samples, cells displayed only weak and diffuse fluorescent signal when labeled

121

with either probe-set, consistent with unspecific background labeling common in RNA-FISH

122

(Tsanov et al, 2016), and occasional bright spots could be observed, mostly located outside

123

cells, presumably due to unspecific probe aggregation (Fig 1d-e and S1a). By contrast, in

124

infected samples, a large proportion of cells showed very strong and localized signal in large

125

regions of the cytoplasm (Fig 1d-e and S1a). Quantification of the fluorescent intensities per cell

126

(see Methods) indicated that 26% of infected cells labeled for the positive strand (n=242) had

127

intensities exceeding a threshold that excluded >99% of uninfected cells (n=83) (Fig 1e). The

128

fluorescence intensity in these cells was on average 23 times higher than this threshold (s.d. 27)

129

(Fig 1e). For the negative strands, we counted 5% of Vero cells with intensities above the

130

similarly defined threshold in infected samples (n=307), vs. <1% for uninfected cells (n=103),

131

with on average 2.5 times higher intensities (s.d. 2.2).

132
133

The fluorescent signal for the positive-strand was remarkably strong compared to the uninfected

134

control images (Fig 1e). This is consistent with an extremely high per-cell viral yield, which has

135

previously been reported for Vero cells (Ogando et al, 2020). The RNA signal was perinuclear

136

and restricted to the cytoplasm, consistent with cytoplasmic replication, as previously reported

137

for other Coronaviridae and recently for SARS-CoV-2 (Snijder et al, 2020; Fung & Liu, 2019;

138

Stertz et al, 2007; Klein et al, 2020). Interestingly, we observed bright foci of different sizes and

139

intensities, some of which displayed hollow structures reminiscent of the replication organelles

140

(RO) or double-membrane vesicle (DMV) structures described previously (Ogando et al, 2020;

141

Klein et al, 2020). The signal of the negative strand was substantially dimmer than for the

142

positive-strand (Fig 1e), in agreement with previous reports that the replication intermediate

143

negative strand is less abundant (Wolff et al, 2020), but potentially also reflecting diminished

144

labeling efficiency of this probe set. The negative-strand RNA likewise forms clusters of different

145

sizes and intensities in the proximity of the nucleus (Fig 1d, Fig EV1a).

146
147

We next wanted to demonstrate the ability of CoronaFISH to simultaneously visualize two RNA

148

species with dual-color imaging (Tsanov et al, 2016). For this purpose, we used different FLAP

149

sequences on the primary probes set (FLAP-X for positive-strand, and FLAP-Y for negative-

150

strand probes), and labeled them with spectrally different fluophores (Atto488 and Cy5). We

151

then imaged infected Vero cells at 18 h p.i. These images clearly show the presence of both

152

positive and negative RNA strands in the same cells and the same subcellular regions, although

153

the relative abundance of both strands appeared to vary from cell to cell and colocalization was

154

only partial (Fig 1f, Fig EV1b). The ability to visualize positive and negative RNA together

155

opens the door to analyzing the intracellular organization of viral transcription and replication

156

dynamics.

157
158

Our data thus show that CoronaFISH probes can sensitively and specifically detect the positive

159

and negative strands of SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero cells.

161

Applicability of CoronaFISH to drug screening

162

We next asked if CoronaFISH can be used to test pharmacological treatments against SARS-

163

CoV-2. To this end, we treated SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells with Remdesivir, an adenosine

164

nucleoside triphosphate analog that reduces viral replication in vitro by inhibiting the RdRP

165

(Gordon et al, 2020). We first established an inhibition curve that showed, in our system, an

166

IC50 concentration of 2.8 µM for Remdesivir (Fig EV1c). We then performed FISH against the

167

positive strand using Atto-488 labeled probes in infected cells left untreated or treated with 10

168

µM of Remdesivir. In untreated samples, 26% of cells (n=143) displayed a strong fluorescence

169

signal (above the 99% threshold defined for n= 273 uninfected cells), as above, whereas

170

Remdesivir-treated cells only showed background signal similar to uninfected cells (0% of

171

n=179 cells above threshold) (Fig 1g,e). These data suggest that our CoronaFISH probes can

172

be used to test molecules for their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication.

173

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human cell lines

174

We next tested the probes in several human cell lines known to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2

175

(Takayama, 2020): Caco-2 (human intestinal epithelial cells), Huh7 (hepatocyte-derived

176

carcinoma cells), and Calu-3 (human lung cancer cells). Each cell line was infected with MOI

177

0.2 and fixed at 36 h p.i. Titration on the supernatants of the infected cells revealed vastly

178

different replication efficiencies as tested by focus forming assay (Table 1). Caco2 and Huh7

179

cells showed rather low virus levels in the same order of magnitude as Vero cells (2-5x103

180

FFU/ml), while Calu3 showed two orders of magnitude higher levels of viral RNA (2x10 5

181

FFU/ml).

182
183

We then performed FISH against the positive RNA strand. As for the Vero cells above, the

184

uninfected controls of all human cell types showed only a weak background signal, while a

7

185

strong signal could be detected in the infected cells (Fig 2a-c). However, depending on the cell-

186

type, the number of infected cells, as well as the amount and cellular localization of vRNA

187

detected by CoronaFISH were very different, consistent with different replication dynamics of

188

SARS-CoV-2 in these cell lines. In Caco-2 cells, only a minority of cells appeared infected (19%

189

of n=1,752 cells above intensity threshold defined from n=229 uninfected cells as above),

190

displaying rather low-intensity values, indicating a low abundance of positive-strand viral RNA

191

(6.2-fold above threshold, s.d. 6.8). Huh7 cells were more permissive for viral infection

192

manifesting in more cells displaying vRNA (74% of n=546 above threshold defined on n=246

193

uninfected cells) and higher RNA signal intensity (11-fold above threshold, s.d. 10). Lastly, all

194

Calu cells were infected (100% of n=773 cells above threshold defined on n=479 uninfected

195

cells) and the signal intensity was higher than in Caco-2 and Huh7 cells (28-fold above

196

threshold, s.d. 14). These data show that CoronaFISH probes can also be used in cell lines of

197

human origin with similar detection performance as in Vero cells.

198

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human tissue

199

Next, we aimed to test if our approach can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples

200

from patients. The major histopathological finding of the pulmonary system of post mortem

201

COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is diffuse alveolar damage

202

in the acute or organizing phases. Lung tissue examination mainly shows evidence of intra-

203

alveolar hemorrhage and edema with fibrin and hyaline membranes developed on alveolar walls

204

at the acute phase and proliferative and fibrotic lesions in the alveolar septal walls at the

205

organizing phase (Hanley et al, 2020; Bradley et al, 2020). However, these lesions are common

206

to multiple forms of ARDS and not specific to COVID-19 and do not shed light on the underlying

207

etiology. CoronaFISH therefore has the potential to specifically detect SARS-CoV-2 infection

208

and characterize viral tropism within the tissue.

210

As a negative control, we imaged a tissue section sample obtained from a deceased adult

211

patient with diffuse alveolar damage from ARDS prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (see

212

Methods). Histological analysis showed diffuse alveolar damage with an important alveolar

213

hemorrhage, an intra-alveolar and interstitial edema with polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate and

214

the presence of early hyaline membrane adjacent to alveolar walls (Fig EV2a). When staining

215

this sample with the positive-strand CoronaFISH probes, no strong fluorescent signal was

216

detected, despite the presence of alveolar damage comparable to patients suffering from

217

COVID-19 (Fig EV2 b-c).

218
219

As a positive control, we used samples from a COVID-19 patient who died 3 days after

220

admission to the intensive care unit. Histological analysis showed diffuse alveolar damage at

221

the organizing phase with intra-alveolar hyaline membranes and fibrin together with interstitial

222

fibrotic lesions with polymorphic inflammatory cell infiltrate of alveolar walls (Fig EV2d).

223

Whereas histology by itself is not sufficient to diagnose lung tissue infection, CoronaFISH

224

revealed infected cells with large cytoplasmic RNA aggregates (Fig 3a), illustrating that viral

225

presence can also be detected in tissue sections. Because of the extensive destruction of tissue

226

architecture, determining the affected area of the parenchyma is challenging. However, the cell

227

types (e.g. macrophages or type 2 pneumocytes) infected by SARS-CoV-2 could be revealed by

228

combining CoronaFISH with immunostaining.

229

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasal swabs

230

Motivated by the previous results, we next attempted to detect viral presence in human samples

231

used for COVID-19 diagnostics. Nasal swabs were collected from patients with respiratory

232

symptoms as part of routine care at the Hospital Ambroise Paré (Paris) (Fig 3b). Samples were

233

screened for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR. The remainder of the sample not used

234

for diagnostics was deposited on coverglass and we performed CoronaFISH against the

235

positive-strand RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Negative samples (RT-PCR Ct value above detection

236

limit) gave no specific signal, but some areas showed substantially higher background than in

237

the cultured cell lines (Fig EV3). This background was rather homogenous, and thus distinct

238

from the RNA signal seen so far in infected cells above. However, in a RT-PCR positive sample

239

(Ct value = 21), we detected a strong RNA-FISH signal in a subset of cells (Fig 3c) when

240

staining for the positive strand. Therefore, although a systematic analysis on many more

241

samples will be required to assess specificity and specificity, our CoronaFISH probes may allow

242

the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in patient-derived samples in a clinical setting.

243

Electron microscopy visualization of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

244

Above, we demonstrated how CoronaFISH allows using different fluorescently labeled

245

secondary detector oligos. We reasoned that this flexibility extends beyond conventional

246

fluorescence microscopy, and could also allow for other imaging modalities including electron

247

microscopy (EM). EM is optimally suited to reveal how infection alters the cellular ultrastructure.

248

Indeed, conventional EM images of glutaraldehyde fixed samples showed a dramatic

249

reorganization of the cytoplasm of Vero cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a

250

loss of Golgi stacks (Fig EV4a,b) and prominent new features, including numerous DMVs (Fig

251

EV4c), which have recently been identified as the main replication organelles of SARS-CoV-2

252

(Snijder et al, 2020; Cortese et al, 2020; Klein et al, 2020; Wolff et al, 2020). Budding of viral

253

particles appeared restricted to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (data not shown)

254

and to electron-lucent vesicles derived from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)

255

that were distinct from DMVs (Fig EV4d), also in agreement with prior studies (Sicari et al,

256

2020).

258

Coupling EM with RNA in situ hybridization (EM-ISH) would allow for ultrastructural studies of

259

SARS-CoV-2 infected cells with direct visualization of the viral RNA. We previously used EM-

260

ISH to detect various cellular RNAs using DNA- or ribo-probes (Hubstenberger et al, 2017;

261

Yamazaki et al, 2018). Here, we adapted this labeling approach by using the same 96 primary

262

oligos against the positive strand of SARS-CoV-2 as before, hybridized to a secondary oligo

263

with Biotin at its 5’ end. These hybrids were detected with an anti-biotin antibody conjugated to

264

10 nm gold particles (Fig 4a). EM imaging was performed on thin sections (80 nm) of Lowicryl

265

K4M-embedded Vero cells, either uninfected or infected (MOI 0.1, 36 h p.i.).

266
267

In uninfected samples, very few gold particles were detected (Fig 4b). Manual counting on

268

random fields yielded a mean of only 0.5 +/- 0.3 gold particles/μm2 in nuclear and cytoplasmic

269

areas (n=9 regions, for a total of 94.4 μm2), indicative of low background labeling. Although a

270

much larger number of small particles was visible, their size was consistent with ribosomes

271

rather than gold particles (Fig 4e,f). In infected cells, gold particles were visible in large

272

numbers at several locations, notably at intracytoplasmic (Fig 4c) and extracellular viral

273

particles (Fig EV4e), as expected. However, DMVs were the most heavily labelled structures

274

(Fig 4d), with manual counts of 180 +/- 39 gold particles/μm2 in DMV zones, a 360 fold

275

increase over uninfected cells (n=11 regions, for a total of 11.9 μm2). Strikingly, we observed

276

gold particles accumulating along DMV internal 10 nm thick fibers and at the periphery of DMVs

277

(Fig 4d, Fig EV4f). Although the nature of these fibers remains to be determined, this

278

accumulation of gold particles could reflect a slow export of the viral genomes through the

279

recently described pores spanning the DMV double membrane(Wolff et al, 2020). Finally, gold

280

particles also labeled large lysosomal organelles, shown to play a role in exocytosis of mouse β-

281

Coronaviruses (Ghosh et al, 2020) and containing densely-packed SARS-CoV-2 virions (Fig

282

EV4f).

Discussion

289

Here, we presented CoronaFISH, an approach based on FISH (Tsanov et al, 2016) permitting

290

the detection of the positive and negative RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2. We validated sensitive

291

and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by fluorescence microscopy in Vero cells, several

292

human cell lines (Caco-2, Huh7, and Calu-3), human lung tissue and nasal swabs. Lastly, we

293

demonstrated the flexibility of our approach, by adapting it for EM imaging of the viral RNA.

294
295

Our two probe sets each consist of 96 probes, each conjugated to two fluorescent dyes,

296

theoretically enabling 192 fluorescent dyes to target each RNA strand spaced along the entire

297

SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This results in a very bright signal, allowing viral RNA detection in

298

challenging samples, as demonstrated with the patient samples, where the increased signal

299

intensity helps to distinguish true signal despite high autofluorescence. Because our probes

300

span the entire length of the ~30 Kb viral RNA, they should enjoy high robustness against

301

mutations or partial RNA degradation. Probes are provided individually in a 96-well plate format,

302

therefore subsets of probes against specific regions (e.g. to target specific viral genes) can be

303

selected individually. Further, the secondary detector probes can easily be swapped, allowing

304

the use of different fluorophores and simultaneous imaging of positive and negative strands or

305

even change the imaging modality, as demonstrated by our EM-ISH experiments. This labeling

306

flexibility, together with the fact that our probes target the entire genome (as opposed to only the

307

Spike gene), make CoronaFISH a useful alternative to commercial FISH-based methods for

308

SARS-Cov-2 RNA detection such as HuluFISH and RNAscope.

309
310
311

Compared to immunofluorescence, our hybridization based technique offers several

312

advantages. First, CoronaFISH directly visualizes the viral genome (and/or its replication

313

intermediate) rather than viral proteins. This provides a more specific indication of viral presence

314

and replication, since viral proteins may be found in cells or subcellular compartments where the

315

viral genome is absent and/or where it does not replicate. Thus, CoronaFISH could be

316

instrumental in distinguishing productive from non productive (abortive) infection (Fehr &

317

Perlman, 2015), as has been reported for example in the context of antibody dependent

318

enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lee et al, 2020). Thereby, CoronaFISH offers a

319

powerful tool to help define the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. In

320

addition, the ability to distinguish and simultaneously visualize positive and negative RNA

321

strands permits the study of replication kinetics in single cells and to uncover spatiotemporal

322

aspects of the infection cycle. Second, the high specificity of these probes owing to their unique

323

complementarity to the SARS-CoV-2 sequence allows to distinguish it from other related

324

viruses, which can be a common problem for antibodies against similar epitopes of different

325

related viral strains. Third, probes can be synthesized within a few days, permitting quick

326

turnover compared to antibody production. Fourth, the CoronaFISH approach is inexpensive.

327

Primary probes can be ordered at low cost, and the provided quantities (smallest synthesis

328

scale provides nanomoles for each oligo) suffice for thousands of experiments. This makes

329

CoronaFISH attractive for high throughput image-based screening of large libraries of antiviral

330

compounds, as illustrated by our Remdesivir experiment.

331

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

332

CoronaFISH can also be used in combination with immunofluorescence for the detection of viral

333

or host proteins (Rensen et al, 2020) and is compatible with GFP stains (Tsanov et al, 2016).

334

Furthermore, RNA-FISH and IF combined have also been shown to be suitable for flow

335

cytometry and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) (Arrigucci et al, 2017). More complex

336

implementations enable multiplexed detection of multiple RNA species (Pichon et al, 2018), and

337

will thus permit to probe the host-pathogen interaction at the single-cell-single-virus level.

338
339

Compared to the analysis of viral RNA using (single-cell) RNA-seq, CoronaFISH provides

340

information on single cells in their spatial context, since experiments do not require cell

341

dissociation. Our approach can thus deliver insights into the viral life-cycle, including occurrence

342

and abundance of positive and negative-strand RNA, their subcellular localization, and their

343

interplay with the host, as well as with structures induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (DMVs,

344

replication compartments, ERGIC). CoronaFISH also provides a unique tool to study virus-host

345

interactions in tissue. Furthermore, studying viral RNA presence in thousands of cells is

346

possible by using automated image analysis, and can hence allow the detection of rare events.

347

This will allow examining the effects of infection on aspects such as cell morphology, cell fusion,

348

cell-to-cell transmission, or tissue (re)organization.

349
350

Our data on nasal swabs suggest that CoronaFISH may be used on clinical samples and

351

potentially as the basis for diagnostic tests. Unlike standard RT-PCR tests, CoronaFISH does

352

not require RNA extraction or enzymatic reagents, which have at times been in short supply. As

353

mentioned above, because we chose probes targeting the whole length of the SARS-CoV-2

354

genomes, CoronaFISH detection is also likely to be more robust to mutations, such as the

355

recently identified VUI-202012/01 (aka B.1.1.7) variant, which has been reported to yield

356

negative results in some PCR tests based on the Spike gene (Investigation of novel SARS-

357

COV-2 variant Variant of Concern 202012/01, 2). The cost of CoronaFISH reagents also

358

compares favorably to those used in standard PCR assays. Despite these advantages, a

359

diagnostic test based on CoronaFISH would face two hurdles: speed and a need for a

360

fluorescence microscope. The duration of the FISH experiment (~2 days) is currently too long

361

for a rapid test. However, microfluidic devices can be used to reduce this delay to less than 15

362

minutes comparable to fast antigenic tests (Shaffer et al, 2015). The requirement for a

363

fluorescence microscope may also be alleviated using cheap do-it-yourself imaging systems, for

364

example smartphones combined with inkjet-printed lenses (Sung et al, 2017; Cybulski et al,

365

2014). Such portable and low-cost imaging systems could potentially facilitate point-of-care

366

diagnostics.

367
368

We believe that the probes and complementary labeling approaches described here expand the

369

toolbox for studying SARS-CoV-2 and hope that the resources provided (sequences, protocol,

370

and source code) will facilitate their adoption by the community to better understand, diagnose

371

and fight this virus.

The probe-design involves several steps to ensure high sensitivity for the detection of SAR-

390

CoV-2 RNA, while minimizing false positive detection of other β-coronaviruses, other pathogens

391

provoking similar symptoms, and transcripts of the host organism. In parenthesis, we list how

392

many probes remain after each selection step for +strand and -strand targeting probes.

393
394

The initial list of probes for the plus and minus strand was generated with Oligostan (N=615 /

395

608) (Tsanov et al, 2016). We then selected all probes with a GC content between 40-60%,

396

probes satisfying at least 2 out of 5 previously established criteria for efficient oligo design (Xu

397

et al, 2009) (N=385 / 362).

398
399

To guarantee that the probes are insensitive towards known mutations of SARS-CoV-2, we

400

selected only probes with not more than 2 mismatches with any of 2500 aligned SARS-CoV-2

401

sequences (N=333 / 311).

402
403

We then performed a local blast against other β-coronaviruses (SARS, MERS, HKU1, OC43,

409

probes with more than 22 matches in any of these blast searches (N=115 / 114).

410

Lastly, we selected the 96 probes with the highest NGS coverage. Probe sequences are

412

provided in Supplementary Table 1.

413

smiFISH

414

To visualize vRNA molecules, we used the smiFISH approach (Tsanov et al, 2016). Unlabelled

415

primary probes are designed to target the RNA of interest, and can be pre-hybridized with

416

fluorescently labeled secondary detector oligonucleotides for visualization. Probes were

417

designed as described above.

418
419

A detailed protocol is available in Supplementary Note 1. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 30

420

min, washed twice with PBS++ and stored in nuclease-free 70% ethanol at -20 °C until labeling.

421

On the day of the labeling, the samples were brought to room temperature, washed twice with

422

wash buffer A (2x SSC in nuclease-free water) for 5 min, followed by two washing steps with

423

washing buffer B (2X SSC and 10% formamide in nuclease-free water) for 5 min. The target-

424

specific primary probes were pre-hybridized with the fluorescently labeled secondary probes via

425

a complementary binding readout sequence. The reaction mixture contained primary probes at

426

a final concentration of 40 pm, and secondary probes at a final concentration of 50 pm in 1X

427

NEBuffer buffer (New England Biolabs). Pre-hybridization was performed in a PCR machine

428

with the following cycles: 85 °C for 3 min, followed by heating to 65 °C for 3 min, and a further 5

429

min heating at 25 °C. 2 µL of this FISH-probe stock solution was added to 100 µL of

430

hybridization buffer (10% (w/v) dextran, 10% formamide, 2X SSC in nuclease-free water).

Infection of cell lines

437

The viral stock used originates from BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 and was kindly gifted by

438

the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses at Institut Pasteur, Paris, and originally

439

supplied through the European Virus Archive goes Global platform.

440

Vero cells

441

The day before the infection, Vero cells were trypsinized and diluted in DMEM – Glutamax 10%

442

FBS. They were then seeded, 8*104 / well, in a 12-multiwell with coverslips. The day of the

443

infection the medium of the cells was discarded and the monolayers were infected with SARS-

444

CoV-2 virus in DMEM – Glutamax 2% FBS for 1h at 37˚C 5% CO2 at a multiplicity of infection

445

(MOI) of 0.02. The MOI used were 0.02. After the desired infection duration, the supernatant

446

was collected for virus titration and the cells were washed with PBS++, fixed with 4% EM-grade

447

PFA for 30 minutes at RT and processed for smiFISH.

Human cell lines

456

The day before the infection, Huh7, CaCo-2, Calu-3 and Vero cells were trypsinized and diluted

457

in DMEM – Glutamax 10% FBS (Huh7 and Vero), MEM 20% FBS + NEAA, Sodium Pyruvate

458

and Glutamax (CaCo-2), RPMI 20% FBS + NEAA (Calu-3). After 6 hours the medium of the

459

cells was discarded and the monolayers were infected in triplicate with a multiplicity of infection

460

(MOI) of 0.2 with SARS-CoV-2 virus in DMEM – Glutamax 2% FBS. After 36h the supernatant

Titration protocol (Focus Forming Assay)

464

Vero cells were seeded in 96-multi wells at 2 x 104 cells/well in DMEM – Glutamax 10% FBS.

465

The following day the supernatants to be titered were thawed and serially diluted in tenfold

466

steps in DMEM – Glutamax 1% FBS. 100 ul of the dilutions were used to infect the Vero

467

monolayers, and incubated for 2 h at 37˚C 5% CO2. The infection medium was then discarded

468

and a semi-solid media containing MEM 1X, 1.5% CMC, 10% FBS was added to the

469

monolayers. The cells were incubated at 37˚C 5% CO2 for 36 hours. Cells were then fixed with

470

4% formaldehyde and foci were revealed using a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV N antibody and

471

matching secondary HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Foci were visualized by

472

diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining and counted using an Immunospot S6 Analyser (Cellular

Image-analysis of infected cell lines

483

Nuclei were automatically segmented in 2D images with an ImJoy (Ouyang et al, 2019) plugin

484

using the CellPose model (Stringer et al, 2020). Source code for segmentation is available here:

485

https://github.com/fish-quant/segmentation. Equidistant regions with a width of 50 pixels were

486

calculated around each nucleus. Overlapping regions from different nuclei were removed. 3D

487

FISH images were transformed into 2D images with a maximum intensity projection along z.

488

Signal intensity for each cell was determined as the 90% quantile of all pixels in the equidistant

Nasal swab patient samples

502

Respiratory specimens (nasal swabs) have been collected from patients with respiratory

503

symptoms as part of routine care at the Hospital Ambroise Paré (Paris) in late March 2020. No

504

additional samples were collected in the course of this work. Patients were contacted, informed

505

about the research project, and given the possibility to oppose the use of their samples for this

506

project. Lack of opposition to participate in clinical research was verified in the records of all

507

patients whose samples were used here. This project has been recorded in the French public

508

register Health-data-Hub (n°F20200717122429). Processing of personal data for this study

Pasteur, Paris using Ag Path-ID One-Step RT-PCR kit® (Thermofisher). PCR reaction was run

528

on the ABI PRISM® 7900 system (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycle settings: 45°C

529

10’; 95°C 5’; 45 X (95°C 15’’; 58°C 45’’). Primer sequences and concentration are provided in

530

Supplementary Table 2.

531

FISH

532

Thin-layered samples on a cover-slide suitable for FISH were obtained with a Cytospin protocol.

533

150 µL of the sample were deposited in a Cytofunnel (Thermo Scientific 1102548). Samples

534

were then centrifuged (800 rpm, 10 min, room temperature) with a Cytospin 4 cytocentrifuge

535

(Thermo Scientific) on Cytoslides (Thermo Scientific 5991059). Cells were fixed in PBS-PFA 4%

536

for 30 min and then conserved frozen in 70% ethanol at -20°C. FISH protocol was performed

537

with Cy3-labeled plus-strand probes labeled with as described above, with one exception: for

538

hybridization 400 µL hybridization buffer was used per sample instead of 100 µL (with the same

539

final probe concentration).

EM-ISH

541

Fixation and embedding for electron microscopy

542

For Epon embedding, cell cultures were fixed for 1 hour at 4°C in 2% glutaraldehyde (Taab

543

Laboratory Equipment, Reading, UK) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.3. During fixation, cells

544

were scraped off from the plastic substratum and centrifuged at 5000g for 15 min. Cell pellets

545

were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and embedded in

546

Polymerization was carried out for 48 hours at 64°C. Ultrathin sections were collected on

Epon.

Formvar-carbon-coated copper grids (200 mesh) and stained briefly with standard uranyl-

548

acetate and lead-citrate solutions.

549
550

Embedding in Lowicryl K4M (Chemische Werke Lowi, Waldkraiburg, Germany) was carried

551

out on Vero cells fixed either in 4% formaldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or in 2%

552

glutaraldehyde at 4°C. Cell pellets were equilibrated in 30% methanol and deposited in a Leica

553

EM AFS2/FSP automatic reagent handling apparatus (Leica Microsystems). Lowicryl

554

polymerization under UV was for 40 h at – 20°C followed by 40 h at +20°C Ultrathin-sections of

555

Lowicryl-embedded material were collected on Formvar-carbon-coated gold grids (200 mesh)

556

and stored until use.

558

Electron microscopic in situ hybridization (EM-ISH)

559

At the EM level, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (+) strand probe was composed of the same set of 96

560

oligodeoxynucleotides that was used for RNA-FISH. The secondary oligonucleotide, however,

561

was modified by a custom-added biotin residue at its 5’-end (Qiagen). Hybrids of the CoV-2

562

RNAs with the probe were detected with a goat anti-biotin antibody conjugated to 10 nm gold

563

particles (BBI international).

564
565

High resolution in situ hybridization was carried out essentially as described previously

566

(Hubstenberger et al, 2017; Yamazaki et al, 2018). The hybridization solution contained 50%

567

deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 2 x SSC, and a final concentration of 80 ng/ml of a

568

mix of 1 µg/µl primary oligonucleotides and 1.2 µg/µl of biotinylated secondary oligonucleotide

569

stored at -20°C. EM-grids, with ultra-thin sections of either formaldehyde- or glutaraldehyde-

570

fixed cells side down, were floated for 3 h at 37-42°C on a 1.5 µl drop of hybridization solution

571

deposited on a parafilm in a moist glass chamber. EM-grids were then briefly rinsed over three

572

drops of PBS and incubated 30 min at RT on a drop of goat anti-biotin antibody (BBI

573

International) conjugated to 10 nm gold particles diluted 1/25 in PBS. EM-grids were further

574

rinsed on 2 drops of PBS and finally washed with a brief jet of deionized water at high intensity.

575

Following a 10 min drying on filter paper with thin-sections on top, the EM grids were stained 1

576

min on a drop of 4% uranyl acetate in water and dried on filter paper 30 min before observation

577

under the EM. Standard lead citrate staining was omitted to favor higher contrast of gold

578

particles over the moderately-stained cellular structures.

579
580

Sections were analyzed with a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro,

581

OR), and digital images were taken with an SIS MegaviewIII charge-coupled device camera

582

(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Quantitation was performed by manually counting gold particles on

583

surfaces that were measured using analySIS software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions,

584

Munster, Germany). Statistics were calculated using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

723

(a) Principle of CoronaFISH. 96 primary probes are pre-hybridized in vitro with dye-carrying

724

secondary probes via the FLAP sequence. Resulting duplexes are subsequently hybridized in

725

cells to target the SARS-CoV-2 positive or negative RNA. (b) Replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2.

726

Incoming, genomic positive-strand RNA is used to produce viral polymerase. Polymerase

727

produces a negative-strand replication intermediate, which serves as a template for synthesis of

728

full-length positive-strand and shorter sub-genomic RNAs. The latter are used to produce other

729

viral proteins. (c) Genome of SARS-CoV-2 with indicated probe positions targeting the positive
