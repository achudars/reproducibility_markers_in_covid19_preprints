Abstract

22

Severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents an

23

immense global health problem. Spike (S) protein of coronavirus is the primary determinant

24

of its entry into the host as it consists of both receptor binding and fusion domain. While

25

tissue tropism, host range, and pathogenesis of coronavirus are primarily controlled by the

26

interaction of S protein with the cell receptor, it is possible that proteolytic activation of S

27

protein by host cell proteases also plays a decisive role. The host-cell proteases have shown

28

to be involved in the proteolysis of S protein and cleaving it into two functional subunits, S1

29

and S2, during the maturation process. In the present study, the interaction of S protein of

30

SARS-CoV-2 with different host proteases like furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin has been

31

analyzed. Incorporation of the furin cleavage site (R-R-A-R) in the S protein in SARS-CoV-2

32

has been studied by mutating the individual amino acid. Our results suggest the polytropic

33

nature of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Our analysis indicated that a single amino acid

34

substitution in the polybasic cleavage site of S protein perturb the binding of cellular

35

proteases. This mutation study might help to generate an attenuated SARS-CoV-2. Besides,

36

targeting of host proteases by inhibitors may result in a practical approach to stop the cellular

37

spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop its antiviral.

Introduction

44

Coronaviruses (CoVs) possesses a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome

45

ranging from 26-32 kilobases in length (Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005). The subfamily

46

Coronavirinae contains a significant number of avian and mammalian pathogens. The

47

subfamily Coronavirinae include Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus,

48

and Deltacoronavirus. To date, six different CoV strains are known to infect humans. The

49

CoVs infecting humans belong to genera alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus. The

50

alphacoronaviruses

51

betacoronaviruses infecting humans are HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, Middle East respiratory

52

syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

infecting

humans

are

HCoV-229E

and

HCoV-NL63,

while

53

The recent pandemic of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

54

also belongs to betacoronavirus. All CoVs share correlation in their genome organization. It

55

consists of 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16), encoded by open reading frame (ORF)

56

1a/b at the 5’ end, followed by the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M),

57

and nucleocapsid (N), encoded by other ORFs at the 3’ end. The entry of coronavirus into the

58

host is a compounded process of receptor binding and proteolytic cleavage of S protein into

59

functional subunits to promote virus-host cell membrane fusion (Heald-Sargent and

60

Gallagher, 2012). The entry can be facilitated by employing fusion either directly at the cell

61

surface receptor or through the endosomal compartment (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). The

62

protruding S protein is responsible for the attachment of the virion to the cell surface receptor

63

and its fusion, enabling the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm (Millet and

64

Whittaker, 2015). The ectodomain of the S protein consists of two functional subunits, S1

65

and S2. The S1 subunit is functionally responsible for receptor binding, while the S2 subunit

66

maintains the fusion machinery process (Millet and Whittaker, 2015). The S protein is a class

67

I viral fusion protein (Bosch et al. , 2003), and is activated by its proteolytic cleavage by host-

68

cell proteases (White et al. , 2008). A variety of host-cell proteases like cathepsin B, trypsin,

69

plasmin, elastase, and cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) have been

70

shown to cleave the S protein of SARS-CoVs to facilitate the viral attachment (Belouzard et

71

al. , 2012). It has been shown that the processing of surface glycoproteins is pre-requisite to

72

produce comparatively more pathogenic and virulent viral particles and inhibition of these

73

proteases likely to inhibit the viral infection as well (Zhou et al. , 2015). Proteolytic activation

74

unlocks the fusogenic potential of viral envelope glycoproteins and it is a crucial step in the

75

entry of enveloped virus.

76

Recent studies have reported the incorporation of the unique furin cleavage site of

77

Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (R-R-A-R) between the boundary of S1 and S2 subunits in the S protein in

78

SARS-CoV-2 (Coutard et al. , 2020). Furin is the calcium-dependent protease that cleaves in

79

an acidic environment after recognizing the specific sequence motif comprises of R-X-R/K-

80

R, where X is any amino acid residue (Izaguirre, 2019). The sequence motifs generally

81

present at the S1/S2 junction of S protein determines the cleavage by many host-cell

82

proteases. Coronavirus has evolved for the proteolytic activation of S protein, and a large

83

number of host proteases can have cognate recognition domain for its cleavage.

84

In the present study, we showed the binding of host-cell proteases (furin, cathepsin B,

85

and plasmin) to the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we analyzed the role of

86

individual residues in the binding of S protein with host-cell proteases by incorporating the

87

single point mutations in its cleavage site.

90

The SARS-CoV-2 sequences were retrieved from GenBank, accession number of

91

each sequence used for the analysis is enlisted in (Supplementary Table S1). The sequences

92

were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm implemented in the sequence alignment program

93

package of MEGA-X software. Three-dimensional model of S protein was generated by

94

using the SWISS-MODEL protein structure homology-modeling server (Waterhouse et al. ,

95

2018), wherein SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (PDB id: 6VSB) was taken as a template. The

96

energy of the modeled structure was minimized by using Yasara software, and finally,

97

validated using PROCHECK (https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889892009944). All the three-

98

dimensional structures were visualized using PyMOL.

Structure modeling of S protein mutants

100

Four different mutants of S protein were constructed with a single residue substitution

101

in amino acid sequence. The mutations were incorporated with proline-to-alanine (P681A),

102

arginine-to-alanine (R682A), arginine-to-alanine (R683A), and arginine-to-alanine (R685A).

103

Further, the three-dimensional structures of the mutants were generated by SWISS-MODEL

104

protein structure homology-modeling and further validated by PROCHECK-Ramachandran

Molecular docking

107

The crystal structure for human plasminogen (PDB id 1DDJ), furin (PDB id 5MIM),

108

and cathepsin (PDB id 1PBH) were retrieved from the protein data bank. The interaction

109

between the proteases and SARS-CoV-2 S protein was performed by molecular docking.

110

Docking between receptor (proteases) and ligand (S protein) was performed using Cluspro

find the interacting amino acid residues spanning the domain of proteases and S protein of

115

SARS-CoV-2 (de Beer et al. , 2014). Finally, the docked models were analyzed for Z-score

116

using the DockScore tool (Malhotra et al. , 2015).

117

Results

118

The alignment of S protein amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs

119

provided critical insights into a unique mutation incorporated in its S1-S2 cleavage site

120

(Figure 1). The unique incorporation of 4 amino acid residues, P681, R682, R683, and A684,

121

were exclusive to the cleavage site of S protein of SARS-CoV-2.

122

The three-dimensional homo-trimer model of SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed 86.3%

123

residues in most favoured regions, 12.6% in additional allowed regions, 0.6% in generously

124

allowed regions and only 0.5% residues in disallowed regions (Figure 2). The final energy

125

after the minimization of the model selected for further analysis was found to be -1715047.7

126

kJ/mol. The wild type S protein showed a significant interaction with furin protease (Figure

127

3A and 3F) with a total of 28 residues of S protein and 27 residues of furin involved in the

128

binding. The interaction includes seven salt bridges, 13 hydrogen bonds, and 198 non-bonded

129

contacts (Table 1). Furthermore, the interactive models of furin with each of the mutant S

130

protein along with their interacting residues are shown in figure 3. The interaction studies of

131

furin protease with different mutants of S protein revealed all the residues participated in

132

hydrogen bond formation and salt bridges in the binding complex (Supplementary Table S2

133

and S3).

134

Similarly, the docking studies between the S protein and cathepsin B protease

135

provided all the interaction details, including hydrogen bond and salt bridges forming

136

residues (Figure 4). The final model evinced six salt bridges, 22 hydrogen bonds, and a total

137

of 270 non-bonded contacts among wild type S protein and cathepsin B protease (Table 2).

138

All the interacting residues for each model are enlisted in supplementary table S2 and S3,

139

respectively. Docking studies between wild type and mutants of S protein with plasmin

140

suggested interacting residues, including both hydrogen bond and salt bridges (Figure 5). The

141

total of 31 residues of wild type S protein showed interaction with 38 residues of plasmin that

142

includes 5 salt bridges, 18 hydrogen bonds and 275 non-bonded contacts (Table 3). Besides,

143

the interaction of mutant S protein with plasmin showed interacting residues, including

144

hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Among the four mutants of S protein, the mutant with the

145

least stability was selected based on the number of salt bridge present. The docking result of

146

mutant with R685A substituted S protein with plasmin showed 1 salt bridges, 22 hydrogen

147

bonds and 200 non-bonded contacts.

148

Discussion

149

It is known that the sequence motifs present between the boundary of S1 and S2

150

subunits of S protein in SARS-CoV determines the active binding and cleavage site for host-

151

cell proteases (White et al., 2008). The results of the multiple sequence alignment suggested

152

the incorporation of four additional polybasic amino acid residues at the S1/S2 site, as

153

reported previously (Coutard et al., 2020). These amino acids signify the involvement of furin

154

as host protease in the proteolytic processing of S protein. The presence of the polybasic

155

cleavage sites for host-cell proteases is shown to directly impact the viral pathogenicity and

156

host range (Nao et al. , 2017). Several other viruses, including zika virus (Nambala and Su,

157

2018), dengue virus (Yu et al. , 2008), avian influenza virus (Alexander and Brown, 2009),

158

and Newcastle disease virus (Kumar and Kumar, 2014, Mohamed et al. , 2011) have also

159

been shown to modulate their pathogenicity by acquiring basic amino acids containing

160

cleavage sites. The docking results of different host-cell proteases revealed their binding to

161

the S protein through the formation of salt bridges and hydrogen bond linkages. The analysis

162

of the residues involved in the interaction shows their presence in the binding complex. To

163

emphasize the role of these additional amino acid residues in the binding of host-cell

164

proteases to the S protein, we sequentially mutated the residues basic amino acid to alanine.

165

Further, we analyzed the binding efficiency of each of the mutant with respective host

166

protease by molecular docking. Firstly, we determined all the residues involved in the

167

binding of host-cell proteases, including furin, cathepsin B, and plasmin with wild-type S

168

protein. The proteomic identification of protease cleavage sites profiling of cathepsin B has

169

revealed a strong cleavage site specificity for amino acid residue glycine and a partial

170

preference for phenylalanine (Biniossek et al. , 2011). The action of pH-independent cysteine

171

protease cathepsin B is vital for the entry, hence the establishment of infection of SARS-CoV

172

(Gierer et al. , 2013). Our docking study denotes crucial details regarding the interaction and

173

binding of cathepsin at the proteolytic cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The enzyme-

174

protein interaction is sufficiently compromised when a single residue is mutated at the

175

cleavage site of the protein. The dwindled and reduced number of salt bridge and hydrogen

176

bond interactions in all mutant models from the wild type model signify a weaker enzyme-

177

protein binding at the mutated cleavage site. Mutation of P682A in the wild type S protein

178

results in the best mutant model that blocks the enzyme active site for cellular proteases,

179

owing to a minimum number of salt bridge and hydrogen-bond formation.

180

The four newly incorporated residues in SARS-CoV-2 have been ascertained to have

181

an implication on the pathogenicity of the virus. The docking studies convey the functional

182

inference of these incorporated residues on the binding of proteases to the cleavage site of S

183

protein. On adequately mutating one amino acid residue at the cleavage site of S protein, the

184

binding of the protein is sufficiently hindered, and the residues of this site are not involved in

185

the interaction with the proteases. The proteolytic cleavage, hence activation of S protein is

186

amply controlled. Plasmin is a crucial enzyme in fibrinolysis and its natural substrate are

187

fibrinogen and fibrin. The cleavage of influenza virus by plasmin is well characterized (Berri

188

et al. , 2013, Goto et al. , 2001, LeBouder et al. , 2010). Role of plasmin has been studied in

189

A/WSN/1993 H1N1 influenza virus where the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site of the virus

190

governs the spread of infection in plasmin dependent manner (Sun et al. , 2010). The pivotal

191

role of plasmin in pathogenicity of influenza virus was explained by the distribution of mini-

192

plasmin and plasmin fragments in epithelial cells of bronchioles (Murakami et al. , 2001).

193

The role of plasmin has also been demonstrated in fusion of respiratory syncytial virus

194

(Dubovi et al. , 1983). The SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by hyperfibrinolysis, as evident by

195

high levels of D-dimers, a breakdown product of fibrinolysis; however, it has been reported

196

that plasmin can cleave S protein of SARS-CoV in vitro. (Chen et al. , 2020, Guan et al. ,

197

2020, Huang et al. , 2020, Wang et al. , 2020). The cleavage of new furin site in the S protein

198

of SARS-CoV-2 by host proteases like plasmin may enhance its infectivity and spread in

199

respiratory cells. The administration of antiproteases to suppress the activity of proteases in

200

the respiratory system may prevent or diminish the entry of virus in the respiratory system.

201

All viral fusion protein undergoes a structural transition and finally attain a compact

202

low energy structure. These conformational changes brought viral and cellular host

203

membrane in close proximity, which induces their fusion, followed by the formation of the

204

pore that allows viral genetic material to enter the cell (White et al., 2008).

205

exemplified by the HA protein of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, where conversion

206

of the monobasic site, cleaved by a trypsin-like protease to a polybasic site, allow cleavage

207

by ubiquitously expressed furin-like proteases facilitate the spread of the virus and making it

208

more virulent (Klenk and Garten, 1994, Lazarowitz and Choppin, 1975). Our results of

209

substitution mutation R682A of S protein showed the least interaction with furin protease

210

compared to its wild type homolog. Also, substitution mutation P681A of S exhibits the least

211

interaction with cathepsin similarly the substitution mutation of R685A of S displays

212

minimum interaction with plasmin protease. The finding suggested that PRRARS amino acid

213

motif in the type S protein are responsible for its proper binding with furin, cathepsin and

214

plasmin host proteases and mutation of these residues impair its interaction. Endoproteolytic

215

cleavage, usually at arginine, is a common post-translational modification for activating

216

several proteins such as peptide hormones and growth factor (Klenk and Garten, 1994).

217

Docking studies revealed that modifications at these particular sites might weaken the

218

interaction between the S protein and the host-cell proteases. Interestingly, the P681 did not

219

directly involve in the binding of any protease. Still, on mutating the residue with alanine

220

(P681A), the binding of all the proteases hindered to a greater extent. This might be due to

221

the fact that proline provides stiffness to the molecular structure, which is required to

222

maintain a proper conformation. Perhaps replacing proline with alanine might result in a local

223

conformation change that further prevents the binding of host-cell proteases to their specific

224

cleavage site.

225

These single amino acid substitutions in the cleavage site helped in understanding the

226

role of individual residue in the binding complex. The participation of these crucial amino

227

acids located at the boundary of S1 and S2 subunits in the proteolytic processing step will

228

provide a unique opportunity to develop a lower pathogenic strain of SARS-CoV-2, which

229

can further be used for vaccine development studies. Considering the fact proven by this in

230

silico analysis that the single amino acid substitutions can help to make an attenuated form of

231

virus, further in vitro work is needed to validate the fact.
