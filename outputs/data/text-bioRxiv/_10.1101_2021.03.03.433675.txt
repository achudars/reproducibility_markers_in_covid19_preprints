ABSTRACT

The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in over 2.2
million deaths. Disease outcomes range from asymptomatic to severe with, so far,
minimal genotypic change to the virus so understanding the host response is
paramount. Transcriptomics has become incredibly important in understanding hostpathogen interactions; however, post-transcriptional regulation plays an important role
in infection and immunity through translation and mRNA stability, allowing tight control
over potent host responses by both the host and the invading virus. Here we apply
ribosome profiling to assess post-transcriptional regulation of host genes during
SARS-CoV-2 infection of a human lung epithelial cell line (Calu-3). We have identified
numerous transcription factors (JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3, HIVEP2 and EGR1) as well as
select antiviral cytokine genes, namely IFNB1, IFNL1,2 and 3, IL-6 and CCL5, that are
restricted at the post-transcriptional level by SARS-CoV-2 infection and discuss the
impact this would have on the host response to infection. This early phase restriction
of antiviral transcripts in the lungs may allow high viral load and consequent immune
dysregulation typically seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

Coronaviruses are enveloped positive sense RNA viruses with an exceptionally large
genome encoding the structural proteins envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid (N), in addition to a plethora of non-structural and accessory
proteins. Infections with endemic human coronaviruses (e.g. 229E, NL63, OC43, and
HKU1) cause a mild common cold, however three novel coronaviruses have emerged
from animal reservoirs in the 21st century, SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2
causing a fatal respiratory syndrome in 34%, 15%, and 3% of cases, respectively with
SARS-CoV-2 being the most infectious [1]. The current COVID-19 pandemic caused
by SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in December 2019 [2] and has since spread across
the globe, causing more than 100 million confirmed cases and over 2 million deaths
(https://covid19.who.int/ accessed February 2021).

SARS-CoV-2 is adept at evading innate immunity [3], the naïve host’s primary defense
against a newly emerged coronavirus. It does this using numerous structural and nonstructural proteins that inhibit interferon (IFN) production and function. Through
blocking IFN, viral replication can proceed unchecked. In addition to antiviral
functions, circulating IFN alerts the host to viral infection with symptoms such as
fever, pain and fatigue [4]. This capacity for stealth replication in the absence of
symptoms allows asymptomatic transmission [5], making it particularly difficult to
control from a public health perspective. Understanding the molecular mechanics of
immune evasion strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2 will allow us to develop more
effective diagnostics, therapeutics, and host prognostic indicators.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables discovery of molecular pathways involved in
SARS-CoV-2 infection. RNA-seq of nasopharyngeal swabs from infected individuals
revealed up-regulation of antiviral factors OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 as well as chemokines
like IP-10, the latter of which showed muted expression in older individuals [6]. Added
to this, transcriptional profiles in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell, animal and patient serum
samples revealed low levels of type I and III interferons but high levels of TNF, IL-6,
RANTES and CCL20 compared to influenza A infection, indicating differences in the
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 compared to another respiratory virus [7]. These
studies have provided a greater insight into potential mechanisms underpinning
COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. However, they do not capture post-transcriptional
regulatory mechanisms, many of which control the initiation, magnitude, duration, and
resolution of the innate immune response [8] or allow the virus to restrict host
gene expression [9].

Here we have used ribosome profiling to assess post-transcriptional regulation of host
gene expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found restricted translation of type
I and III IFNs 24 hours post infection as well as numerous transcription factors and
antiviral cytokines. This data provides a set of genes likely responsible for the delayed
antiviral responses seen in SARS-type coronavirus infections strengthening
development of molecular-based strategies to combat this devastating pandemic.

RESULTS

Development of a SARS-CoV-2 infection model in Calu-3 cells
Of the multiple organs that SARS-CoV-2 infects, viral load is highest in the lungs, and
infection of this organ is a significant driver of pathogenesis [10]. We therefore chose
a lung epithelial cell line known to be productively infected with SARS-CoV-2 to
investigate host responses to infection. Calu-3 cells are a human immortalized cell
line derived from lung adenocarcinoma which express sufficient levels of ACE2 to
allow SARS-Cov-2 entry. We found SARS-CoV-2 infectious titres peaked 24 hours
post infection in Calu-3 cells (Figure 1A) as per other studies [11]. Both SARS-CoV-2
intracellular genomic RNA (Figure 1B) and N protein (Figure 1C) followed similar
kinetics with peak viral load post 24 hours infection. Immunofluorescence staining of
SARS-CoV-2 N-protein over a time-course from 1-48hrs showed infection of more
than 50% of cells after 24 hours (Figure 1D).

Having developed an infection model in Calu-3 cells, we proceeded to capture
transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes in gene expression at 24 hours post
SARS-CoV-2

infection

using

method

deemed

for

containment infections [12]. Cells were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen to lock ribosomes
onto their associated mRNA, avoiding artifacts introduced by translation inhibitors like
cycloheximide [13]. Both total RNA and RNA protected by protein from micrococcal
nuclease (MNase) digest were purified. The latter, named herein as ribosome
footprints were further purified to contain fragments between 25 and 35nt which spans
the possible 80S ribosomal footprint on actively translated mRNAs (Figure

of the total mRNA libraries, while more than 50 million reads were obtained from
the MNase-digested small RNA libraries.

than down-regulated genes (166 versus 63, Figure 2A) using a log2 fold change cutoff of 1 and p-value cut-off of 0.05. Upon inspection of the genes up-regulated by
SARS-CoV-2 infection, many genes were previously annotated antiviral genes (Figure
2A). To confirm this, the 229 significantly altered genes were submitted
to https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ for

using

the Uniprot keyword database. The top seven significantly enriched keywords are
plotted in Figure 2B. Antiviral defence showed the highest fold enrichment and a pvalue <0.001. Other significantly enriched keywords included innate immunity, RNAbinding and transcription. Of the 134 Antiviral defence keywords, 27 were up-regulated
by SARS-CoV-2 and are listed in Figure 2C. Many of these genes, including IFIT1,
IFIT2, IFIT3, RSAD2, OASL, HERC5, DDX58 and MX2 were also upregulated in
nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID19 patients [6].

MNAse digestion of cell extracts yields CDS-mapped ribosome footprints

Next, we proceeded to analyse the reads generated from sequencing of sizeselected MNase-digested RNA to understand the translatome in SARS-CoV-2
infected cells. 50% of the reads (approximately 25 million reads) mapped to protein
coding sequence in both mock and infected cells (Figure 3A), indicating close to 50%
coverage of the 18 million nucleotides of coding sequence predicted in the human
transcriptome [14]. This finding implies that sequencing depth was sufficient to make
gene level inferences on differential ribosome density.

More than 50% of reads

mapped to the first 30 nucleotides of tRNAs mostly carrying the small neutral amino
acid Glycine and some carrying the small to medium sized acidic amino acids,
Glutamate and Aspartate (data not shown). These tRNA reads and the less abundant
reads mapping to other non-coding RNA were filtered out and remaining reads
mapped to different features of human protein coding genes. Most of these filtered
reads (60%) mapped to within the CDS (Figure 3B). The 3’UTR and 5’UTR had 20%
and 7% of the reads respectively no significant difference between mock and infected
cells was observed. Annotated start and stop codons were present in 2% and 6% of
the reads, respectively with no difference between mock and infected. When highresolution metagene analysis of transcript coverage was performed, a gradual
increase in coverage was seen leading up the start codon, whereby coverage
increased 8-fold to a peak around 30nt consistent with ribosomes initiating at the start
codon (Figure 3C and D).

Eukaryotic 80S ribosome footprints are ~28-30 nucleotides in length [15]. To confirm
that

were calculated for reads mapping to the CDS and the 5’UTR region as 80S

summarised across all genes. Density peaked at 28-30 nucleotides in coding
sequence in both mock and infected cells indicative of bona-fide ribosome footprints
(Figure 3E). Read-lengths higher than 30 nucleotides showed an exponential
shortening towards 40 nucleotides suggesting single nucleotide degradation, while
those shorter than 30 nucleotides were staggered suggestive of footprints derived from
smaller non-ribosomal RNA binding proteins. In the 5’ UTR read lengths also peaked
at 30 nucleotides indicative of translation in the 5’ leader as documented elsewhere
[17] but at >6-fold lower density compared to the CDS mapped reads (Figure 3E).
There was no significant difference in 5’ UTR ribosome occupancy between mock and
infected cells apart from greater variance between replicates in the infected samples.

counts from MNase-digested

RNA libraries, we compared the translatome of mock versus SARS-CoV-2 infected
Calu3 cells. Here 11,455 genes passed the threshold (>1 counts per million in at least
three samples), comparing well to numbers passing threshold expression for
the transcriptome (Figure 4A). Three genes (KRT17, CDKN1A and TOM1) showed
more than a 2-fold decrease in expression. 18 genes showed more than a 2-fold
increase in expression upon infection and are mostly antiviral, i.e., Interferoninduced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT), oligoadenylate synthase (OAS),
DDX58 (RIGI) and Interferon-induced GTP-binding protein Mx1 (MX1). Of note is that
many genes seen upregulated at the whole transcript level were not seen to be
differentially expressed when ribosome-associated RNA was sequenced.This
transcriptome-only change contrasts with other stimulatory contexts where 9% of

genes showed transcriptome-only upregulation and 85% of genes showed translationonly upregulation [18].

We investigated this paucity of up-regulated genes further, using functional annotation
clustering on the differential expression gene lists for RNA-seq versus Ribo-seq.
Using Uniprot keywords to classify genes, showed an absence of keywords ‘Signal’,
‘Secreted’

and

‘Transcription

regulation’

in

the Ribo-seq gene

list. These three annotation groups include genes such as IFNL1, CCL5, IFNB1, IL6,
ATF3, JUN, SETD1B and REL (Figure 4B). To summarise this apparent block
in expression at the Ribo-seq level we heat-mapped the log2 fold change of upregulated RNA-seq transcripts included within ‘Innate immunity’, ‘Transcription’ and
‘Cytokine keywords’ alongside their log2 fold change as determined by Ribo-seq.
Within the ‘Innate immunity’ annotation group, most genes upregulated by RNAseq were also upregulated by Ribo-seq, except for NLRC5, a negative regulator of
NFKB and IFN-I signalling [19], which was 2.2-fold and 6.2-fold induced by viral
infection for RNA-seq and Ribo-seq, respectively. Within the ‘Transcription’ annotation
group, 37 (84%) of the differentially expressed genes by RNA-seq were restricted in
expression by Ribo-seq, with one of the most restricted being JUN (3.7-fold increase
by RNA-seq and 1.3-fold decreased by Ribo-seq). Those un-restricted at the Riboseq level included ZNF107, TXNIP, IRF1 and TRIM22. The third annotation group we
analysed was ‘Cytokine’, where all three Interferon lambdas (IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3),
Interferon beta, IL6, CCL5 and CXCL11 were not increased at the Ribo-seq level as
they were for RNA-seq. Cytokines with no restriction at the Ribo-seq level were
TNFSF10 (TRAIL), CXCL10 (IP10), CX3CL1 and CSF1.

Coverage of individual genes confirms post-transcriptional restriction of IL6,
CCL5, JUN and IFNB1
To examine ribosome occupancy pattern across the length of interesting genes we
collected sample normalized, per nucleotide coverage statistics for individual
transcripts. Coverage values for all transcript variants were summed at each position
from the transcription start site. Gene-level coverage for RNA-seq reads was even
across the 5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR with a decrease observed at the 3’-end termini due
to

terminal

transcript

variants

(Figure

5).

Conversely, Ribo-

seq coverage was minimal >100 nucleotides up and down from the start and stop
codon, respectively, and this was most evident in genes that were well-occupied by
ribosomes, i.e. TNFSF10. IRF7 showed noticeable Ribo-seq coverage in the full
length of the 5’ and 3’UTRs which were uniquely short. Genes presented here that
were upregulated when expression was assayed by RNA-seq and not by Riboseq included IL6, JUN, IFNB1 and CCL5 (RANTES). These genes show a noticeable
increase in RNA-seq coverage over the CDS from mock to 24h SARS-CoV-2 infection
(top right quadrant, Figure 5) consistent with log2 fold change calculated from count
data. The transcription factor REL, showed equivalent up-regulation by RNAseq and Ribo-seq coverage contrary to the count data, which showed a 2.5-fold
increase by RNA-seq (p-value = 2.267x10-7) versus 1.3-fold increase by Ribo-seq (not
significant). Unlike the aforementioned genes; IRF7, CXCL10, TNFSF10 (TRAIL),
OAS2 and IRF1 showed up-regulation by RNA-seq and Ribo-seq. This was not due
to higher levels of peak coverage as CXCL10 only reached 30 stacked reads per
nucleotide (coverage), equivalent to CCL5 which was not concordant between RNAseq and Ribo-seq in relative changes between mock and 24h SARS-CoV-2 infected.

Neither were Ribo-seq reads in the 3’UTR associated with discordance as both IL6
and IRF1 showed peaks >250 nucleotides downstream of the reference sequence
stop codon. In summary, while transcript levels for genes like IL6, CCL5, IFNB1 and
JUN were upregulated, these transcripts were not increased in their association with
ribosomes suggesting a restriction in the antiviral response.

mRNA features influence the likelihood of translation inhibition
Differential expression analysis of Ribo-seq count data allowed us to examine the
genes which up-regulated in ribosomal occupancy and is a closer approximation to
protein output and phenotype than RNA-seq [20]. However, to understand the
mechanism through which a restriction in ribosome occupancy occurs, we need to
separate the two processes of transcription and translation. Translation efficiency
considers

levels.

We

utilized

a

method, Riborex,

whereby RNA-seq count data obtained from matched biological samples is factored
into a generalized linear model for the Ribo-seq counts to find genes with differential
translational efficiency [21].

Many transcription factors and secreted proteins, which encompass cytokines were
found to have short half-lives in mouse embryonic stem cells [22]. To assist in
explaining why some cytokines and transcription factors were sensitive to translation
inhibition while others were not, we categorized genes based on their mRNA stability
as documented by Sharova et al. [22] 6,878 genes with known mRNA half-lives and
which passed the default threshold values for Riborex differential expression analysis
are presented in Figure 6A. By separating genes into stable mRNAs (half-life >5 hours)
and unstable mRNAs (half-life < 5 hours) we found 0.5% of stable mRNAs and 0.2%

of unstable mRNAs were increased in translation efficiency. Conversely, more
unstable mRNA genes were decreased in translation efficiency, 3.5 % compared to
0.74% of stable mRNAs. The genes with the greatest log2 fold decrease, JUN,
ZBTB20 and IL6 were all unstable mRNAs. Across all genes, unstable (half-life <5
hours) mRNAs showed a log2 fold change in translation efficiency significantly lower
than stable mRNAs (one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA], p < 0.001; Figure 6B.

dsRNA in virally infected cells can trigger the activation of PKR leading to sustained
phosphorylation of EIF2A and inhibition of translation initiation thereby limiting the
availability of translation machinery for the virus [23]. A subset of (~200 genes in
mouse embryonic fibroblasts) stress-response genes are resistant to phosphorylated
EIF2A-induced shut down owing to the presence of upstream open reading frames
(uORFs) in their 5’UTRs [17, 24]. To determine if uORFs conferred protection from
translation inhibition seen here, we sorted genes based on the presence of an
upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the 5’ UTR as catalogued for 2659 human
genes by McGillivary et al. [25]. JUN, ZBTB20 and IL6 all have no uORFs, while 1.5%
of downregulated genes contained no uORF and 1.8% containing at least one uORF,
respectively were decreased in translation efficiency (Figure 6C). Across all genes the
mean log2 fold change in translation efficiency was lower for those genes containing
an

uORF

(one-way

6D.

Since mRNAs predicted to contain at least one uORF are more likely to be decreased
instead of increased in translation efficiency, uORFs are protective against translation
inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further explore this, we obtained a list of 68
homologous genes known to increase in translation during EIF2A phosphorylation
(EIF2A-P) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and contain an uORF in humans. We then

compared them with significantly altered genes from our mock versus SARS-CoV-2
infected comparison of translation efficiency. We found no EIF2A-P enhanced genes
in the genes upregulated in translation efficiency by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure
6E). Eighteen genes were downregulated in translation efficiency by SARS-CoV-2 but
known to increase in the presence of EIF2A-P in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This
finding gives further weight to the hypothesis that downregulation of translation
efficiency by SARS-CoV-2 is independent of EIF2A-P.

DISCUSSION

Largely driven by signaling molecules called interferons (IFNs), the innate immune
system first recognizes non-self, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
such as double stranded RNA through host proteins DDX58 (RIG-I) and toll-like
receptor 3/7 (TLR3/7). This recognition initiates phosphorylation and activation of
transcription factors IRF3, AP1 complex and NFKB. In infected lung epithelial cells,
these transcription factors activate transcription of genes which can be categorized
into three groups. i) Type I and III IFNs (IFNB and IFNL) which increase transcription
of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) including IRF7 which fuels further IFN
transcription [26], ii) Proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-6 and IL-1β which prepare
bystander immune cells to fight the infection and iii) chemokines like CCL5 (RANTES)
and CXCL10 (IP-10) to attract distal immune cells to the site of infection. IFNs are
arguably the most immediate of these three antiviral effectors, binding to their cognate
receptors on already infected and neighboring cells, activating kinases JAK and TYK2,
which then phosphorylate STAT1, STAT2, MAPK, PI3K allowing their translocation to
the nucleus for activation of target genes with diverse antiviral functions [26].

SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably sensitive to type I IFN pre-treatment [11], suggesting that
limiting IFN production, rather than function is the main mechanism through which
SARS-CoV-2 achieves high viral loads concomitant with delayed or absent symptoms.
Non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) was found to be one of the most potent inhibitors of
IFNB1 promoter induction of 26 viral proteins tested [27]. Nsp1 acts to inhibit host
translation by blocking the mRNA entry tunnel on the 40S ribosome [28]. This
interaction can also lead to endonucleolytic cleavage in the 5’ UTR preventing the
recruitment of more ribosomes to host mRNAs [29, 30].

Studies in bronchial epithelial cells show posttranscriptional restriction of IFNL1/2,
IFNB1, CCL5 and IL6 by SARS-CoV-1 and not Dhori virus, an orthomyxovirus known
to also productively infect 2B4 cells [31]. Here we corroborate these findings in Calu3
cells using

an unbiased

genome-wide methodology

showing

that

antiviral

cytokines (IFNL1-3, IFNB1, CCL5, CXCL11 and IL6) are restricted in translation at 24
hours post infection. This is consistent with the delayed IFN response seen in
COVID19 [32]. Importantly, in a mouse model of SARS-CoV, IFN was only detected in
the lung after viral load had already peaked rendering this arm of innate immunity
entirely ineffective [33].

A host driven delay in IL6 protein production is unlikely because poly I:C treatment of
Calu-3 cells results in a 2-12 fold increase in secreted IL-6 in just 4 hours, with the
upper range dependent upon a Th1/17 cytokine environment [34]. IL6 is a significant
driver of fever [35], which was an initial symptom in 41% of 174 health care workers

Moreover, early IL6 and

CCL5 signalling enhances recruitment of innate immune cells and resolution lung
pathology caused by respiratory syncytial virus [39, 40] suggesting that timing is
important for the antiviral activity of these pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In

addition

to the

abovementioned antiviral

cytokines,

we show that select transcription factors are restricted at the posttranscriptional
level, with JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3, HIVEP2 and EGR1 showing the greatest restriction
when accounting for the increase in substrate mRNA while REL and CREB5 were
significantly upregulated by RNA-seq but not Ribo-seq when analysis was performed
on un-normalized Ribo-seq reads. JUN regulates transcription of IFNB1 mRNA as
part of the enhanceosome, encompassing ATF2, JUN, IRF3, p50, p65, CBP and p300
[41]. Post-transcriptional restriction of JUN could limit enhanceosome formation and
IFN induction. Indeed, weak induction of IFNB1 mRNA was seen by SARS-CoV-2 in
Calu-3 cells compared to Sendai virus [42]. ZBTB20 promotes Toll-like receptor innate

In contrast, ATF3 is anti-inflammatory, reducing IL6 and IL12B transcription as part of
a negative feedback loop [44]. Restriction in ATF3 protein expression may contribute
to un-controlled IL6 production in cells that overcome the translational block, either

and is negatively regulated by MAPK14 (p38 MAPK) to resolve inflammation [47].
The increase in MAPK14 (p38 MAPK) signalling in aged tissues may contribute to
uncontrolled IL6 production [48]. HIVEP2 may also be anti-inflammatory, acting as an

EGR1 does have a clear antiviral function, suppressing foot-and-mouth disease virus
(FMDV), Sendai virus and Seneca Valley virus through phosphorylation of TBK1, an
important kinase that activates IRF3 [50]. Pos-transcriptional restriction of EGR1 may
contribute to delayed IFN responses. Transcription factors REL and CREB5 were
significantly upregulated by RNA-seq but not Ribo-seq. REL in heterodimers with
RELA is a key transcriptional activator of IFNL1 in human airway epithelial cells [51],
thus translational blockage could potentially limit IFNL1 transcription. However,

of PARP14 may further limit this anti-coronaviral protein to support viral
replication. ZC3HAV1 plays important roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of
mRNA during the stress response enacting degradation of host and viral mRNAs,
translational repression, and microRNA silencing [54]. ZC3HAV1 is known to
be antiviral to a suite of viruses including retrovirus, alphavirus, filovirus
and hepadna virus by degrading viral RNA. It is also pro-apoptotic by inducing
degradation of TNFRSF10D (TRAIL Receptor 4) mRNA, a decoy receptor in the
TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway. Thus, post-transcriptional restriction of ZCSHAV1
would likely favour SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Many cytokines, transcription factors and growth factors are time limited in their
effects by RNA binding proteins recruited to AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3’
untranslated region (UTR). Conditions where ARE-containing mRNAs are stabilized
for too long can lead to chronic inflammation [55]. For example, decreased expression
of the ARE binding protein AUF-1 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) patient samples leads to stabilization of IL-6, CCL2, CCL1 and CXCL8
mRNA [56]. Many of the genes we found to be inhibited in translation were
unstable. JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3 and HIVEP2 have half-lives of 1.3, 2.91, 2.17 and 2.03
hours in contrast to IRF7 which has a half-life of 15 hours. In mouse embryonic stem
cells IL6 has a half-life of only 1 hour. This was confirmed in lung epithelial cells where
half-life was 40 minutes in the presence of TNF and 80+ minutes in the presence of
IL-17 [57].

Assuming a closed loop model of translation facilitated by the eIF4G (5’ cap) to
poly(A)-binding protein (3’ tail) interaction [58], stabilized mRNAs are more likely to
have ribosomes that re-initiate on the same mRNA, a process coined closed-loop
assisted reinitation (CLAR) [59]. Mammalian ribosomes translate at approximately 6
seconds per amino acid [60] and must be spaced ~100 nucleotides apart [61]. Thus,
IL6 would only have time to reinitiate approximately four ribosomes per mRNA,
HIVEP2 only one, while IRF7 would survive long enough to house its maximum of
15. Consistent with this, mRNAs bound by multiple ribosomes have higher mRNA
stability than those bound by a single ribosome [62]. mRNAs using CLAR are less
dependent upon scanning mechanisms performed by EIF4F/EIF4A and initiate more
efficiently [63]. Mechanisms of translation inhibition occurring prior to mRNA
engagement i.e. virally encoded Nsp1 [45] and host encoded 4E-BP1 [64] should be
less effective on closed loop mRNAs. While there currently lacks direct evidence that
CLAR ribosomes resist translation inhibition by viral Nsp1 or host 4E-BP1, the
increased representation of unstable mRNAs in downregulated genes shown here,
combined with a potential for reduced access to the mRNA entry tunnel in CLAR
ribosomes suggests this might be the case and warrants further investigation.

We found that mRNAs containing at least one high-confidence uORF were more likely
to be decreased in translation efficiency. Given that most genes preferentially
translated in the presence of PKR phosphorylated EIF2A contain an uORF we propose
that PKR is not directing posttranscriptional restriction in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3
cells at 24 hours post infection. Moreover, eighteen genes known to be increased in
translation in the presence of phosphorylated EIF2A were significantly decreased in
translation efficiency by SARS-CoV-2 suggesting a mechanism independent of EIF2A

repression. This leaves Nsp1 or 4E-BP1 as likely responsible for the restriction and
further experiments will aim to confirm this.

Research into the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still in its
infancy. We have limited patient data on the early molecular response because when
patients present to the clinic, they have been infected for days already, yet this
response is so important for viral control and transmission reduction. Here we have
used RNA-seq and Ribo-seq in human bronchial epithelial cells to assess the early
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the level of transcription and translation. We
found a robust antiviral host response at the level of transcription with upregulation of
IFNB1

and

IFNLs, Interferon-induced proteins

with tetratricopeptide repeats,

oligoadenylate synthase, antiviral cytokines and transcription factors following SARSCoV-2 infection of Calu-3 cells, strengthening previous findings [65]. The biological
effects of these genes are mediated by protein not mRNA. We have increased the
biological relevance of transcriptome analysis by demonstrating restricted translation
of IFNB1, IFNL1-3, CCL5, CXCL11, IL6, JUN, ZBTB20, ATF3, HIVEP2, REL,
PARP13, PARP14 and EGR1, which have direct antiviral and/or immune regulatory
functions. Moreover, we found that unstable mRNAs are more sensitive to SARS-CoV2 induced translation inhibition and propose that the inhibition may occur at the level
of mRNA engagement with the ribosome. Upstream open reading frames were not
protective suggesting a mechanism independent of EIF2A repression, which
incidentally occurs post mRNA engagement.

In summary, we identify a selection of antiviral and immunological genes that are
restricted early in SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells and highlight that mRNA

stability contributes to gene selectivity. Since cytokine mRNA stability is altered in
chronic inflammation, assessment of translation restriction during SARS-CoV-2
infection in these contexts is warranted. This may help us understand the wide range
of prognoses during infection.

Presently, this study provides detailed molecular

insight into the delayed interferon response employed by SARS-CoV-2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell culture
VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained in Gibco Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles
Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies). Calu3 cells were
maintained in Gibco Modified Eagles Medium (MEM) supplemented with 20 % (v/v)
FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Life
Technologies). All cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2).
Infections
All virology work was conducted at the CSIRO Australian Centre for Disease
Preparedness at physical containment (PC)-4. The isolate of SARS-CoV-2
(BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020) was received from the Victorian Infectious Disease
Reference Laboratory (VIDRL, Melbourne, Australia) and passaged in VeroE6 cells
for isolation, followed by passaging in VeroE6 cells for stock generation. All virus
stocks were aliquoted and stored at −80°C for inoculations. The infectious titres of

SARS-CoV-2 stocks was determined by TCID50 assays performed as described
previously [66]. Samples were titrated in quadruplicate in 96-well plates, co-cultured
with VeroE6 cells for four days and monitored for development of cytopathic effects
(CPE). Calu3 cells were fixed for 30 min in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained
with a polyclonal antibody targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein (Sino
Biological, catalogue number: 40588-T62, used at 1/2,000) for 1 h. Cells were
subsequently stained with 1/1,000 dilution of an anti-rabbit AF488 antibody (Invitrogen
catalogue number A11008). Nuclei were counter-stained with diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). Calu3 cells were imaged using the CellInsight quantitative
fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a magnification of 10 x, 49
fields/well, capturing the entire well. The relative viral antigen staining was quantified
using the Compartmental analysis bioapplication of the Cellomics Scan software.
Calu3 cells were grown to 80 % confluency in T25 culture flasks prior to infection
with SARS-CoV2 (MOI 1) or mock infected for RNA sequencing experiments.
MNAse digest and RNA extraction
Isolation of whole-cell RNA and purification of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs)
was performed based on the protocol described in (Reid et al, 2015, Methods). Cells
were harvested on a dry ice-ethanol slurry in 300 μL ice-cold lysis buffer (1 %(v/v)
IGEPAL, 200 mM KOAc, 25 mM K-HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl, 4 mM CaCl2) and
incubated on ice for 10 mins. The lysate was then clarified by centrifugation (8600 xg,
5 mins, 4°C). 50 μL clarified lysate (supernatant) was set aside for RNA-seq analysis
while 200 μL was digested with 300 U/mL micrococcal nuclease S7 (MNase; Sigma
Aldrich) for 30 mins at 37°C to generate ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Both
digested and undigested RNA was then purified by phenol:chloroform extraction using

for sequencing. RPFs were purified from undigested RNA via electrophoretic
separation on a TBE-urea polyacrylamide gel (ThermoFisher) and excision of the
region between 25 and 35 nt using an RNA marker. 400 μL 400mM NaOAc, pH 5.2,
was added to the excised gel and incubated for 10 mins at -80°C. RPFs were then
purified from the gel through three successive cycles of incubation at 95°C for 5 mins
followed by vortexing for 20 mins, before extraction using a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate
column (Corning) by centrifugation (10 mins, 20,000 xg). 1 mL ethanol and
30 μg/mL GlycoBlue™ co-precipitant was then added to the flowthrough and
incubated for 1 hour at -20°C to precipitate the RPFs, followed by centrifugation (15
mins, 20,000 xg, 4°C). The resultant pellet containing RPFs was washed twice in icecold 80% (v/v) ethanol, with centrifugation (5 mins, 20,000 xg, 4°C) following each
wash. The RPF pellet was then air-dried and resuspended in nuclease-free water
prior to RNA sequencing. The quality and quantity of RNA was assessed for all
samples using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Carla, USA).
RNA sequencing
RNA-Seq was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).
Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA and small RNA libraries were prepared, followed by
sequencing on an Illumina Novaseq-6000. Raw data were assessed for overall quality
using fastqc v0.11.8. (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).

used to generate mapping stats on reads aligned to the indicated features (again
obtained from BioMart) after filtering out reads mapping to non-coding RNA. The
exception was stop and start codon sequence which was obtained using the STAR
alignment files followed by featureCounts as per CDS counts but using stop_codon
for the -t flag. For coverage analysis, transcriptome-mapped bam files from the STAR
alignment were sorted and indexed using Samtools. Sorted bam files were converted
to bed files and read depth at each genome position with 1-based coordinates
determined using Bedtools version 2.29.2 [72] using a library normalisation factor
obtained from DESeq2 analysis of the different experimental groups. For metagene
analysis of coverage relative to the start codon, the distance from the transcription
start site for each gene was extracted from the GENCODE v35 primary assembly of
GRCh38.p13 gtf file then used to summarise coverage for across genes using scripts
in R. Read-length distributions were obtained using Samtools stats on position sorted
alignment files from reads mapped to human CDS and 3’UTR sequences downloaded
from Biomart (https://m.ensembl.org), read-length distributions were summarised
across all genes. Differential expression analysis of translation efficiency was
performed using Riborex package in R using DESeq2 as the modelling engine [21].
