Abstract
The human pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is responsible for the major pandemic of the 21st century. We analyzed
>4,700 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public
repositories. SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a high sequence identity (>99.9%),
which drops to >96% when compared to bat coronavirus. We built a mutationannotated

haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and >160 sub-branches
representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing
a uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could complicate the design

haplogroup B1, with a TMRCA dating to 12 November 2019 - thus matching
epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2a originates in China and
represents the major non-Asian outbreak. Multiple founder effect episodes,
most likely associated with super-spreader hosts, explain COVID-19 pandemic
to a large extent.

Introduction
The human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was first detected in late 2019 in patients from the city of Wuhan (Hubei
province, China) suffering from respiratory illnesses and leading to a disease
that has been popularized as coronavirus disease or COVID-19. The disease
was declared an International Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020,
and a few weeks later, on 11 March 2020, it was declared a pandemic by the
World Health Organization ((WHO) 2020). Even though it has not been possible
to trace an index case, there is a large amount of epidemiological information
that has been very useful for tracking the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The first report of COVID-19 took place on 1 December 2019, in a patient from
Wuhan, most likely linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale market of the city.
Some public reports indicate that the first cases could date back to midNovember 2019. The number of cases grew gradually during December, and
most of them were related to the aforementioned seafood market. In midJanuary 2020, a number of patients appeared in other provinces of China,
probably favored by the large annual human migration associated to the Spring
Festival travel season (starting in mid-December and lasting for about 40 days).
Soon covid-19 spread to other Asian countries (South Korea, 20 February
2020), and beyond: Middle East (Iran; 19 February 2020), USA (20 February
2020), Europe (Italy and Spain, 31 January 2020), etc.
Wu et al. (2020) reported the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2
(29,903 bp length), from a worker at the Wuhan market admitted to the Central
Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019; this patient experienced severe
respiratory syndrome. The authors identified a new RNA virus strain belonging
to the family Coronaviridae that was subsequently designated as ‘WH-Hum 1
coronavirus’ (and also ‘2019-nCoV’). According to Coutard et al. (2020) the
nearest bat precursor would be RaTG13 with a genome identity to SARS-CoV-2
of 98%. Phylogenetic studies supported the theory of a natural origin for SARSCoV-2 (Andersen et al. 2020).
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a
growing interest in exploring genetic variation in the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
Identifying patterns of genomic variation can help understand the origin and

characterization of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the geographic mapping of the
different clades spreading worldwide, and of the impact of the outbreaks on the
genome variability of the virus. Initial analyses so far used a limited number of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and focused mostly on various evolutionary aspects of
the coronavirus genomes (Andersen et al. 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Li et al.
2020; Shen et al. 2020). The Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data
GISAID (Shu and McCauley 2017) provides public access to the most complete
collection of genetic sequences of several viruses, with special emphasis on
influenza viruses. In 2020, the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data
GISAID (Shu and McCauley 2017) started to compile sequence data from the
virus causing COVID-19 disease, and now it makes thousands of genomic
sequences of the virus available. The China National Center for Bioinformation
keeps

(https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/tool/annotation; (Zhao et al. 2020) and provides
different analytical tools to study SARS-CoV-2 variation. The open-source
project Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org; (Hadfield et al. 2018) provides an
interactive web portal that allows navigating SARS-CoV-2 genome variation and
helps track the spread of disease outbreaks.
In the present study, we built a solid phylogenetic skeleton of SARSCoV-2 genomes that allows to investigate sequence variation in a large number
of genomes (>4,700; Supplementary Material) deposited in GISAID, explore
site-specific mutational instability, investigate phylogeographic patterns of
variation worldwide, and clarify the role of super-spreader hosts in the
pandemic.

Results
Identity of SARS-CoV-2 to other closely related species
Human SARS-CoV-2 genomes have a within sequence identity of 99.98%
(Table 1); and are much more identical to bat coronavirus than to pangolin
coronavirus, although the values vary substantially depending on the specimen,

93.44%–96.17% (Table 1). When compared to pangolin coronavirus, the range
of genome identities drops to 85.24%–92.35%.
Between 1,699 and 3,727 substitution variants separate the pangolin
coronavirus genomes from the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, and this
range drops to 1,105 to 1,369 (Table 1) when compared to bat coronavirus.
The bat #412976 coronavirus genome is conflictive because it has an unusual
amount of mutational differences with respect to the SARS-CoV-2 reference
and has an abnormally low sequence identity with human coronavirus
(76.87%), comparable to pangolin coronavirus. This genome is problematic in
the sequence alignment and should be avoided in future comparative analyses.

Inter- and intra-specific phylogeny and the root of SARS-CoV-2
An inter-specific Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree was built using pangolin, SARS,
and bat coronavirus genomes as outgroups to investigate their phylogenetic
relationships with SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary material). The tree depicts
the SARS coronavirus genome occupying the most external branch. Next, all
the pangolin genomes cluster separately from bat and human coronavirus,
which also group separately. In line with its very low identity with SARS-CoV-2,
bat-412976 behaves as an outlier in the tree. Overall, the clustering pattern in
the tree is in very good agreement with sequence identity values (Table 1).
We next focused our attention on the root for all existing SARS-CoV-2
genomes, assuming the bat coronavirus as its closest coronavirus relative. We
built a new ML tree including all SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced up to 29
February 2020 (n = 621); almost all of them are of Asian origin and this group
should contain the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA), as it is evident
from phylogenetics and epidemiology that the origin of the pandemic is in China
and more particularly within haplogroup B (see below and Supplementary
Material). The ML tree unequivocally reveals that the root of SARS-CoV-2 is
located in the basal B1 haplogroup (B1 genomes that do not belong to derived
B1 sub-clades; Figure 1), and therefore points to B1 as the clade at the origin
of the pandemic.
SARS-CoV-2 weighted mean substitution rate, as inferred from the ML
tree, is 5.42×10-4 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) (Bootstrap 2.5% – 75%
confidence interval: 4.29×10-4–8.02×10-4 s/s/y) according to an uncorrelated

relaxed-clock method; a slightly higher mutation rate of 6.05×10-4 s/s/y
(Bootstrap 2.5% – 75% confidence interval: 4.46×10-4–8.22×10-4 s/s/y) was
obtained assuming and strick-clock model.
According to a relaxed-clock model mutation rate the TMRCA for all
SARS-CoV-2 genomes dates to 12th November 2019 (Bootstrap 2.5% – 75%
confidence interval: 7th August 2019 to 8 December 2019), fully matching
epidemiological dates; estimates using an strick clock mutation rate varied very
little: 7th November 2019 (Bootstrap 2.5% – 75% confidence interval: 18 August
2019 to 2 December 2019).
The most parsimonious tree (fully developed in Supplementary Material
Figure S4; see also skeleton in Figure 4A) shows that the two very stable
transitions C8782T and T28144C (3 and 1 total occurrences in the phylogeny,
respectively) separate SARS-CoV-2 variation into two main clades, A and B,
both originating in China. Sub-haplogroups emerging from these main clades
are mainly supported by single mutations, most of them being very solid along
the phylogeny (Table S1), and therefore granting the robustness of the different
clades. It is notable that the structure of the branches in the parsimonious tree
fully agrees with the skeleton shown in the ML tree.
Haplogroup B (19.65% of the genomes in the database; n = 664) is
present in all continents; being more prevalent in North America (46.35%),
South America (25.93%) and Asia (22.33%), and having the lowest frequencies
in Africa (8.33%) and Europe (3.74%) (see frequency interpolated maps in
Supplementary Material). B1 is separated from B by a single transition
(C18060T) and it is by far the most numerous B subclade (n = 424; 63.86% of
all B). The main proportion of B1 lineages worldwide is present in North
America (n = 365; 86.04% of all existing B1 genomes). Most of the B1 genomes
belong to the subclade B1a1 (B1a[A17857G]>B1a1[C1774T]); this contains at
least 11 minor sub-clades, each defined by characteristic single mutations. In
consonance with the root of SARS-CoV-2 being within B, we observed that
basal haplogroup B is more prevalent in Asia (70%) than in anywhere else, and
it is the only region containing genomes belonging to all first level B-subclades
(B1, B2, B3, etc; perhaps with the exception of the minor clade B9). It is
noticeable however that, within B, the fourth level sub-clade B1a1 is the most
frequent haplogroup in the database (399/664; 60.09%) and it appears mainly

in North America (accounting for 357 [333 in USA] out of the 399 B1a1 counts
in the database; 89.47%), while it is absent in Asia; Figure 2. In Europe, the
main B sub-clade is B3a (61.02%), which is particularly prevalent in Spain, one
of the main European epicenters of COVID-19. It is most likely that most of
these B3a representatives arrived in South America from Spain (where it
represents 71.43% of all B genomes) given the high connectively between the
two regions; Figure 2. The high B3 frequency observed in Spain marks a
notable difference with respect to other European countries; 32 out of the 37
(86.49%) B3 genomes in Europe are located in Spain.
Haplogroup A (n = 2,715), with complementary frequencies to B, is the
predominant clade all over the world (Figure 2), although with heterogeneous
distributions (Supplementary Material). It reaches its highest frequencies in
Europe (97.1%) and Africa (93.1%), is relatively high in Asia (76.3%) and
Oceania (77.4%), and it has the lowest frequencies in South America (68.2%)
and North America (53.1%). By far, the most frequent sub-clade of haplogroup
A is A2a (n = 1,849; 68.10% of all A genomes), which is the main representative
of the non-Asian outbreak, followed by A1a (n = 287; 10.57%). Even though
A2a is mostly present in Europe (n = 1,199; 64.85% of all A2a sequences), and
North America (n = 370; 20.01%), it most likely originated in Asia
(Supplementary Material). A3 is mainly found in Asia, and especially in the
Middle East (81.25%); its sub-clade A3a is also highly prevalent in the same
region (31.94%) but shows even higher frequency in Oceania (44.44%). Other
minor clades are found in more restricted areas; for instance, A4a (n = 39;
1.44% of A) is only found in Wales (Europe), while A5, A7 and A9b appear only
in Asia.

(mainly in China), while some minor ones appeared outside Asia (next section;

The number of sequences belonging to clade A and its main sub-clades
increased exponentially during the outbreak occurring outside Asia at the end of
February 2020, while the frequency of haplogroup B genomes increased more
slowly at that time (Supplementary Material). Nucleotide diversity is almost
homogeneous in all the different geographical regions for the main

haplogroups; however, haplotype diversity (HD) values vary more substantially
among haplogroups, probably indicating the weight of sequence founders in this
index (see next section on super-spreaders); Supplementary Material.

Super-spreaders and founder effect
It is remarkable that a few haplotypes are disproportionally represented in
continental regions or in particular countries (Supplementary Material; Figure
S10), appearing abruptly in a few days’ period. This pattern is compatible with
super-spreaders arriving to certain geographic locations and giving rise to
severe founder effects (Figure 3A). Haplotypes #H1, #H2, #H3, and #H4 (ID’s
as in Table S8) are the most frequently repeated ones. H1 (n = 163; haplogroup
A2a4), represents one of the main haplotypes responsible for the introduction or
the pandemic in Europe (104/163; 63.80%), with particular frequency in the UK
(35/163; 21.47%) and Belgium (23/163; 14.11%); it is also prevalent in North
America (with a one week delay; 15/163 13.50%), and Australia (18/163;
11.04%). H2 (n = 133; A2a2a) occurs also in Europe at high frequency (75/133;
56.39%; 34 times in Iceland) and in North America (48/133; 35.82%; mostly in
USA with 45 occurrences). H3 (n = 132; B1a1) appears at remarkably high
frequency and almost exclusively in USA (126/132; 95.45%; B1a1). H4 (n = 78;
A) corresponds to the reference sequence (GenBank acc. nº MN908947.3) and
it reaches the highest frequency in Asia (60/78; 76.92%), particularly in China
(49/78; 62.82%); the frequency of H4 increased in two pulses, one coinciding
with its first appearance in China at the end of December 2019, and the next
coinciding with the large Asian outbreak in mid-February 2020; later, H4 moved
to other non-Asian locations, e.g. USA (10/78; 12.82%).
There are additional examples of SARS-CoV-2 super-spreading (Table
S8) appearing in restricted geographical areas. For instance, H8 (n = 33; A3)
appears at high frequency in Japan (28/33; 84.85%). In Iceland, founder
haplotypes represent a large proportion of all existing haplotypes on the island
e.g. H7 exists only in Iceland (n = 37), and together with H2 (n = 34 in Iceland)
and other four haplotypes, makes up 39.18% of all the haplotypes in this
country. In USA, H3 occurs 126 times, and H2 45 times; together with other five
haplotypes, they make up 31.75% of all genomes in this country. In the UK,
eight haplotypes make-up 28.95% of the total haplotypes. H9 (n = 26; B3a) and

H14 (n = 22; A2a5) are probably the main haplotypes responsible for the
Spanish outbreak; H9 (21/26 in Spain; 80.77%) is particularly interesting
because it belongs to haplogroup B3a, while almost all European haplotypes
belong to haplogroup A (Supplementary Material; Figure S9); H14 appears 9
times in Spain (9/22; 40.91%).
Common haplotypes are frequently shared between neighboring
countries, an observation mirroring the easy spread of the virus over short
geographic distances; for instance, H33 (n = 9; of which 7 are in Portugal and 2
in Spain) or H45 (n = 7; of which 4 are in Portugal and 1 in Spain).
Table 2 shows normalized phylogenetic tree features for a selected
number of super-spreader candidates. For each geographical region, we
additionally obtained index values for the rest of the tree excluding these
candidates. The phylogenetic trees have expected values compatible with
super-spreader transmissions and incompatible with super-spreader chains. For
instance, clade A2a2a in Iceland has Colless’s I of 0.866 while it is only 0.143
when excluding candidate super-spreaders nodes. The ILnumber (A2a2a:
0.885 vs. Remaining Tree (RT): 0.415), the Sacking index (A2a2a: 0.881 vs.
RT: 0.207), and the staircase-ness

(A2a2a: 0.925 vs. RT: 0.685) are also

consistently high as expected from super-spreader transmissions, as they are
also the low values of cherries (A2a2a: 0.148 vs. RT: 0.592) and pitchforks
(A2a2a: 0.111 vs. RT: 0.408). The rest of the super-spreader networks in Table
S1 follow the same pattern.
Networks of super-spreader candidates (Figure 3) show a star-like
shape that is characteristic of super-spreader transmission and that clearly
differentiates from patterns in the general tree that are more characteristic of
homogeneous or chain of transmissions. The most outstanding super-spreader
event occurred in the Washington state (Figure 3). This network involved about
328 genomes and its shape clearly suggests that a single super-spreader
(carrying a coronavirus belonging to B1a1 lineage) could drive an important
proportion of coronavirus transmissions. The data available in the present study
cannot definitely identify if all these sequences in the clade were the result of
one or a few super-spreader persons; such level of detail might only be
determined using epidemiological and clinical data.

Values for the Diamond Princess shipboard are also comparable to those
obtained for the super-spreader candidates (Table 2; Supplementary
Material).Evolution of effective population size of SARS-CoV-2
Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot (EBPS) analysis undertaken on genomes
sampled until the end of February (see Supplementary Material) reflects with
great precision the main COVID-19 epidemiological episodes. If we consider the
estimated TMRCA for SARS-CoV-2 to 12th November 2019 and allow 14-24
days of disease incubation (until approximately the 6th of December), this leaves
a period of two or three weeks of silent local transmission of the virus until the
first case is reported in Wuham on 30th December 2019. From this moment, Ne
begins to slightly increase for a couple of weeks (Figure 4B), followed by
exponential growth from 20th January 2020, coinciding with the Asian outbreak.
The peak is reached on 30th January 2020, matching the Asian lockdown.
Consequently, Ne drops remarkably for the next couple of weeks, but starts to
grow progressively again from 12th February 2020, coinciding with the
beginning of the non-Asian outbreak.
By overlapping COVID-19 incidence (officially reported cases per day
worldwide; https://ourworldindata.org) with the EBPS plot, we observed
comparable shape distributions, but with a remarkable 14–15 days’ delay in
reported cases per day worldwide with respect to the EBPS distribution (Figure
4B).

Discussion
We have undertaken a large-scale study on SARS-CoV-2 genomes considering
a sample that is more than an order of magnitude higher than those of previous
studies. By focusing on high-quality (HQ) genomes, we devoted great effort to
elucidate the most parsimonious phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2. This effort has
allowed us to present novel phylogeographic inferences on the origin and
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strains. In particular, we discovered a few dozen
genomes (representing > 1/3 of the total database) that played a fundamental
role as super-spreaders of COVID-19 disease. These SARS-CoV-2 strains
(belonging to different haplogroups), occur with remarkable frequency in the

dataset and became founders in restricted regions or countries in short time
periods (of a few days).
SARS-CoV-2 genomes show very high identity among themselves
(>99%) and lower to bat coronaviruses (>96%; BatCoV RaTG13); these values
are very identical to earlier estimates based on a limited number of SARS-CoV2 genomes (Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020). The pangolin coronavirus genome,
initially proposed as the original host of SARS-CoV-2, shows significantly lower
identity. The high identity observed between SARS-CoV-2 genomes and other
betacoronaviruses adds support to its zoonotic origin from a bat relative
(Ceraolo and Giorgi 2020). The differences found between SARS-CoV-2 and
their most related coronaviruses in horseshoe bat indicate that large number of
mutational jumps were needed to generate these differences from a common
ancestor which could have existed in a time frame between 1948-1982 (Boni et
al. 2020). Divergent genomes could have been incubated in animal reservoirs
before the zoonotic jump to humans in the shape of a B1 genome, in a process
similar to that observed for palm civet as intermediary in other SARS
coronavirus (Hu et al. 2017). These new coronaviruses would be able to use
human ACE2 receptor to infect patients. Patterns of variation observed in
SARS-CoV-2 could be explained assuming a unique index case, which would
already contain the very specific and well-conserved PFCS insertion. This
original B1 genome would then start to diverge very soon in Wuham in two
directions of the phylogeny, giving rise to its most frequent sub-lineage B1a1
and, almost simultaneously, to other B lineages and the large haplogroup A
(timeline in Figure 4C).
According to our inferences, the TMRCA for all SARS-CoV-2 genomes
would be 12th November 2019. Assuming a maximum incubation time in
humans of up to 24 days (Guan et al. 2020), the virus could have been infecting
the first citizens from Hubei in a silent mode of transmission until the end of
November 2019; and started to be noticed by Chinese health authorities in
early to mid-December. The EBSP distribution suggests that the Ne of SARSCoV-2 could have started to grow significantly from 30th December 2019, i.e.
only two-three weeks after the initial cases reported and probably favored by
super-spreaders (e.g. genomes like the reference sequence played a special
role in the beginning of the Asiatic epidemic). Subsequently, it followed an

exponential growth that marked the beginning of the Asian outbreak on the 20th
January 2020 and lasted until the end of this month. Next, Ne experienced a
notable drop coinciding with human intervention and quarantine implemented in
Asia on 30th January 2020. Finally, the beginning of a second wave of
expansion outside Asia starting around 12th-27th February 2020 is also wellrecorded on the SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Figure 4C).
The two-week delay between the dates suggested by the EBSP
distribution and the official documented incidence of COVID-19 in Asia could be
due to the mean incubation time of the disease, but also to the number of cases
officially declared being well below the real incidence.
With the data available in GISAID, we were not able to detect association
between main haplogroups and age and sex of carriers. Further research is
needed to investigate the possible differential effect of strains (haplogroups)
with the disease outcome.
Evidence of natural selection acting on SARS-CoV-2 genomes needs
further investigation (Supplementary Material), although the data suggest
purifying selection acting on most of the SARS-CoV-2 genes when explored at
an inter-specific level, and weaker intra-specific purifying selection. In
agreement with this latter observation is the recent report indicating a 81
deletion at gene ORF7a that would convert the coronavirus in a less virulent
pathogen with reduced short-term selective advantage (Holland et al. 2020).
None of the HQ genomes investigated in our report carry this deletion.
In contrast to the weak (or null) action of positive selection on COVID-19
spread, there is strong evidence pointing to the role of genetic drift occurring in
many continental regions and restricted locations, especially outside China.
Phylogeographic analysis allowed us to investigate pandemic dynamics
worldwide. The high incidence of a few lineages outside Asia was more
probably due to drift and not selective advantages. The main non-Asian subclade A2a was probably among the first ones to leave Asia before this region

transmission facilitated by super-spreaders most likely occurred worldwide. In
Iceland, Gudbjartsson et al. (2020) recently showed a contact tracking network
(their Figure 4B) that could represent one of the many super-spreading events
that existed in Iceland and that is indirectly observed in our analyses. These
haplotypes have three differential features: they reached high to moderate
frequencies in the population, they are characteristic of specific continental
regions or even individual countries, and they appeared in a very short time
period of only a few days. Network analyses of best super-spreader candidates
add further support to the figure of super-spreaders in the pandemic. These
analyses allowed to differentiate both haplotypes that were most likely
transmitted by super-spreaders from those that were most likely transmitted by
super-spreader chains, chains and homogeneous transmissions. The data
suggest that these genomes have played a fundamental role in COVID-19
spreading; they alone represent 34.61% of the total genomes in the database.
This finding is in good agreement with results originated from epidemiological
studies and observations as well as mathematical simulations (Endo et al. 2020;
Kupferschmidt 2020). The role of super-spreaders is well reported in previous
pandemics, including SARS, MERS and Ebola (Stein 2011; Wong et al. 2015).
We found the 12bp polybasic furin cleavage site (PFCS) in all SARSCoV-2 genomes with only two substitutions in two different genomes (belonging
to different haplogroups; Supplementary Material). This segment is therefore
highly mutationally stable. A BLAST search (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) of
the PFCS indicates that this sequence segment is absolutely specific of SARSCoV-2. The fact that the PFCS has been found universally in all SARS-CoV-2
suggests that this insertion was acquired before the zoonotic event and not
after (Andersen et al. 2020). The virulence conferred by this deletion to the
coronavirus constitutes the focus of several studies (Lau et al. 2020).
The origin of SARS-CoV-2 has become a very popular question. The
results of the present study (TMRCA dating of SARS-CoV-2, EBSP plot, and
phylogeny) are compatible with an index case living in Wuhan-China, belonging
to basal haplogroup B1, and most likely existing not before the beginning of
November 2019. Subsequently, the coronavirus was transmitted from a living
animal to a human host and then it started to spread from human to human. By
analyzing stored biological samples from cases occurring at the beginning of

the epidemy in Wuhan, it would be possible to narrow the search for patient
zero among those belonging to the root of B1. The phylogeny built in the
present study would be compatible with a single patient zero initiating the
epidemic. Identifying the index case would help better understand how and
when the spread of the pandemic begun, a lesson that would be useful in future
pandemics. In agreement with previous studies (Andersen et al. 2020), the
theory of SARS-CoV-2 originating artificially in a lab finds no support in the
results of the present study, in the sense that variation (within and between
other species), and the step-wise mutational evolution observed at SARS-CoV2 genomes is as expected for a RNA virus in nature.
This study warrants further expansion to clarify the role of superspreaders in COVID-19 by investigating epidemiological data locally. Detecting
and analyzing the genome of super-spreaders might shed light on the specific
host genetic background contributing to their increased propensity to transmit
the pathogen, as well as to understand the mechanisms of infection and
transmission of the pathogen. Moreover, the phylogenic precision to which we
classified SARS-CoV-2 genomes will also serve disease studies aimed at
understanding the potential role of different pathogen strains in disease
outcomes, and how these correlate to, and interact with, host genomic
susceptibility.

Material and Methods
Database of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
We downloaded 4,721 complete genomes from the GISAID database
(https://www.epicov.org/epi3/frontend) on 6 April 2020; 3,481 out of these 4,721
sequences were noted as high quality (HQ; > 29Kb, high cover only) based on
the information provided by GISAID on 8 April 2020. Unless otherwise
indicated, our analyses were carried out using the HQ SARS-CoV-2 genomes
(see results). Although SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, the data deposited in
GISAID are in DNA format. Metadata for these genomes was downloaded from
the Nextrain repository (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov/tree/master/data) on
7 April 2020; this contains information on geographic location of the sample
(city, country, and continental region) date of submission, age, gender, etc. This

data allowed the marking of each genome by date when the virus was isolated
(“Location date”) and geographic origin, among others. We also downloaded
coronavirus genomes from nine pangolins and bat genomes analyzed in the
Guangdong province (GISAID IDs [omitting prefix “EPI-ISL-“]): #410544,
#410721, #412860, #410539, #410539, #410538,

#410543, #410542,

#410541, #410540), three bats (#402131, #412977, and #412976) and the
reference SARS genome (GenBank acc. nº: NC_004718.3). In addition, we
downloaded genomes analyzed from a tiger (GISAID: #420293) and a dog
(GISAID: #414518) presumably infected with SARS-CoV-2 by humans.
The SARS-CoV-2 genomes were aligned against the reference
sequence used by e.g. Nextstrain and many authors, with GenBank acc. nº
MN908947.3 (submitted on 5 January 2020; GISAID ID #402125). This was the
first SARS-CoV-2 genome released on GenBank.
Alignment of SARS-CoV-2 genomes against the reference sequence
was carried out using MUSCLE v3.8.31 program (Edgar 2004).
Apart from the discarded low-quality (LQ) sequences, and in order to
ensure comparability between genomes, we trimmed the 5’ and 3’ untranslated
regions; retaining a consensus sequence of 29,607 bp that runs from position
169 to position 29,776.
Interspecific phylogenetic analysis
We built a maximum likelihood (ML) tree in order to investigate interspecific
phylogenetic relations between SARS-CoV-2 genomes and nine pangolins,
three bats, and the reference SARS genome (GenBank acc. nº: NC_004718.3).
Interspecific alignment was carried out using MAFFT program (Katoh et al.
2002) with default parameters. Genetic distances (F84) were computed using
dnadist and default parameters, and the tree was built using dnapars; both
programs are included in the software Phylip-3.697. With the SARS-CoV-2
genes aligned for all genomes with nucleotides in frame, and the ML tree, we
used PAML 4 (Yang 2007) to compute the statistics ω = Ka/Ks (also known as
dN/dS), where Ka is the number of non-synonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site, and Ks refers to synonymous substitutions per synonymous
site. This ratio allows to measure the strength and mode of natural selection
acting on the protein genes.

Intraspecific phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2
There have been several attempts at reconstructing the phylogeny of SARSCoV-2 genomes. At present there is no consensus phylogeny identifying the
mutational changes characterizing main clades and sub-clades. Many of these
earlier attempts used only a reduced number of genomes (Forster et al. 2020).
The interactive web-phylogeny presented by Nextstrain is probably the most
elaborate attempt carried out to date; this resource defines two main branches,
A and B, and 9 sub-branches that cluster a variable number of sequences
ranging from only 3 (haplogroup A7) or 52 sequences (haplogroup A6) to 2,279
(A2a) (28 April 2020). GISAID identifies three large clades according to
changes located in the ORF8 gene and other sequence variants: a) Clade S:
change L84S, with S referring to the SARS-CoV-2 spike S-glycoprotein located
on the surface of the viral envelope, and sequence variant T28144C; b) Clade
G: change D614G and sequence variant A23404G; and c) Clade V: NSP3G251V and sequence variant G26144T. In addition, GISAID refers to clade
‘Other’, which is in reality a paraphyletic clade. Note that GISAID uses the
reference sequence of a SARS-associated coronavirus sequenced in 2003
(Marra et al. 2003).
Here we used different strategies to build the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2.
First, a phylogeny based on ML was carried out to find the phylogenetic root of
all SARS-CoV-2 using the most similar pangolin and bat coronavirus to the
SARS-CoV-2 genome as ancestral relatives (GISAID IDs [omitting prefix “EPIISL-“]): #410721, #402131 respectively). In the particular case of SARS-CoV-2
and taking into account epidemiological evidence, we know for sure that its root
is among the first genomes sequenced in China (most likely in its Hubei
province). Therefore, we used only genomes available until the end of February
to build the ML tree in order to reduce the noise generated by an unnecessarily
large number of genomes that were sequenced later and spread outside China.
Second, the most parsimonious strategy allows to determine main and
secondary sub-clades of the SARS-CoV-2 tree, identifying the characteristic
mutations of clades. This phylogenetic procedure also allows to count the
occurrences of mutations along branches, which serves as a good proxy for
mutation-specific stability (Weissensteiner et al. 2016). We followed the HQ

standards used to generate the most robust molecular phylogeny based on
maximum parsimony, the human mtDNA (van Oven and Kayser 2009),
although the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and the use of a variety of NGS
techniques (Bandelt and Salas 2012), prevents the filtering out of sequencing
errors as efficiently as in other well-known haplotypic-based phylogenies (Salas
et al. 2005). Thus, we took the following steps with regards to data filtering:
1. We used only genomes labeled as ‘high-coverage only’ and ‘complete’ in
GISAID.
2. We collapsed the sequences to the common sequence segment. NGS
procedures generate artifacts at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome
sequences, which generally consist of deletions. Before eliminating the
extremes of the sequences, we checked in the complete genomes
available if there were any variant that could be phylogenetically
informative.
3. A solid phylogeny should be based on stable mutational variants; thus,
only branches supported by at least five genomes were considered.
4. Since many sub-haplogroups are supported by single mutations, we only
considered those having mutational stability.
We observed an excess of reversions at the tips of a few phylogenetic branches
(e.g. C14805T reversion in a few A1a sequences). This phylogenetic noise
could be due to the high mutational rate of the mutations involved,
recombination (which is not unusual between coronaviruses (Rehman et al.
2020)), or sequencing errors. For this reason, we decided to not resolve these
branches further, while we await new evidence based on higher sequence
quality genomes.
By simple counting of the mutational hits along the branches and at the
tips of the phylogeny, it is possible to infer the relative mutation stability of
diagnostic sites. The mutations at the tips of the phylogeny were counted only
once within each terminal branch. Table S1 reports the number of occurrences
in both the tree branches and in the tips of the phylogeny.
Finally, in order to guarantee the robustness of the phylogeny, we
checked that inferences on the root and phylogeny estimated from the ML tree

were in good agreement with the pattern of mutations observed in the most
parsimonious tree.
Phylogeny of super-spreader event
According to Colijn and Gardi (2014) “there are simple structural properties of
phylogenetic trees which, when combined, can distinguish communicable
disease outbreaks with a super-spreader, homogeneous transmission and
chains of transmission”. On the other hand, Leventhal et al. (2012) states that
“The level at which a phylogenetic tree is able to resolve any contact structure
depends on the rate of evolution of the pathogen. In cases such as HIV, where
the rates of evolution are high enough to result in substantial genetic
differences between virus populations of individual hosts, a phylogenetic tree
may reveal contact structure down to the individual level”. As the SARS-CoV-2
has a comparable mutation rate as HIV (Lemey et al. 2006; Patiño-Galindo and
González-Candelas 2017; Zanini et al. 2017), we carried out phylogenetic
analysis aimed at distinguishing patterns of super-spreader transmission and
super-spreader chain of transmission.
In particular, we are interested in computing phylogenetic features of SARSCoV-2 transmissions for our best candidates (those haplotypes that have
experienced a high frequency locally and in a short time period) and compare
them to those obtained using the remaining haplotypes from the same specific
region. We first built phylogenetic trees from sequence alignments using
SplitsTree5 (Huson and Bryant 2006). We used the R library phylotop (Kendall
et al. 2018) to calculate the following tree features (Colijn and Gardy 2014):
•

Cherry number/n: It is the number of cherries over number of leaves. It is
slightly lower and more variable for super-spreader out-breaks.

•

Colless’s I (index) or imbalance: It reaches higher values for superspreader out-breaks

•

IL number: portion of internal nodes with one leaf descendant. It reaches
higher values for super-spreader out-breaks

•

Pitchforks: as cherries, pitchforks decrease with increasing infection rate
(Metzig et al. 2019).

•

Sacking index: it is the mean path length form tip to root. Slightly higher
in super-spreader outbreaks and lower in chain out-breaks.

•

Staircase-ness: defined as the portion of imbalance nodes (Norström et
al. 2012). It shows much lower values for chain out-breaks.

These values were computed for the main super-spreader candidates in
specific geographic regions and also for the tree that includes the remaining
haplotypes from the same region. The comparison between values in both trees
allows to compare different transmission patterns from the same cultural/social
context.
In addition, we also carried out network analyses for a reported event of
a super-spreader occurred in the Diamond Princess shipboard for which we
could access to 25 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. According to Sekizuka et al. (2020)
the super-spreading event occurring in the shipboard may have originated from
a single COVID-19 patient who had disembarked in Hong Kong on 25 January
2020.
To visualize the super-spreader phylogeny, we built phylogenetic median
joining networks using POPART software (Leigh and Bryant 2015).
Statistical analysis
The average number of nucleotide differences per site between DNA
sequences or nucleotide diversity (π) (Nei and Li 1979), sequence/haplotype
diversity (HD) and Tajima’s D statistics (Tajima 1989) were computed for the
main continental regions, haplogroups and gene partitions. Tajima’s D is a test
for neutrality in the context of infinite-sites model of sequence evolution and it is
negligibly affected by S, sample size, and recombination (Ramirez-Soriano et
al. 2008).
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was undertaken to identify clusters of
genetic variation by examining (a) all the variation observed in the SARS-CoV-2
genomes and (b) the phylogenetic diagnostic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 tree
inferred from parsimony. For this, we used the function cmdscale (library stats)
from the statistical software R Project for Statistical Computing v. 3.3.1
(https://www.r-project.org/; (Team 2012)).
The geographic representation of haplogroup frequencies in world maps
was carried out using SAGA v. 7.6.2 (http://www.saga-gis.org/) (Conrad et al.
2015), and the ordinary Kriging method. We used only sampling points with 10
samples or more; to avoid unnecessary loss of sampling points, a few of them

were collapsed into nearest points to represent local areas, whenever possible,
in order to reach the minimum sampling required.
From the sequence alignments and annotated files, we summarized
information on mutational patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Table S2 and
S3). We used a Fisher’s exact test to check if there are differences in the
transition-to-transversion ratio (ts/tv), and the synonymous/non-synonymous
changes.
We carried out the ML phylogeny and Extended Bayesian Skyline plot
analysis using the sequences collected before 29 February 2020 (n = 621). We
constructed the ML tree using RAxML-HPC v.8 (Stamatakis 2014) using rapid
bootstrapping analysis with 1,000 iterations. The best maximum likelihood tree
was

visualized

and

using

FigTree

v.1.4.4

(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). The ML tree and sampling dates were
used for estimating the Time of the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA)
and molecular rates, fitting a molecular clock to the phylogeny through a fast
relaxed-clock method based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model of
substitution rates, and using the R package treedater (Volz and Frost 2017). We
selected the best molecular clock model by testing if the relaxed-clock offers
better fit to data, and also identified and removed tip outlier lineages that fit
poorly the substitution model in order to obtain a tree that could fit better the
molecular clock. We estimated confidence intervals for rates and dates using a
parametric bootstrap approach.
The demography of SARS-CoV-2 sequences was inferred using the
Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot method (EBSP) (Heled and Drummond 2008)
implemented in BEAST v2.6.2 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007). EBSPs allow
the inference of effective population size (Ne) through time and also estimate
the number of demographic changes from the data. We used strict-clock and a
rate of evolution of 0.80 x 10-3 [0.14 x 10-3 – 1.31 x 10-3] s/s/y based on recent
estimations (http://virological.org/t/phylodynamic-analysis-90-genomes-12- feb2020/356). Two independent Markov chain-Monte Carlo runs of 200,000,000

10% discarded as burn-in. EBPS data was plotted using R software (Team
2012).
The meta-data in GISAID contains information on gender and age of the
COVID-19 patients. This data, in combination with the phylogeny, allows
investigating for possible association among haplogroups, gender and age.
Association tests were carried out for the main (sub)haplogroups (A, B, A1a,
A2a, A3, A3a, A4a, A9b, B1a, B3a; all with sample size > 50). We carried out a
Mann-Whitney test to analyze haplogroup association with age. Because each
region has its own haplogroup frequency patterns and epidemiological
characteristics, we considered a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test using all the
sampling data per regions and main haplogroups. Association between
haplogroups/regions and gender was explored using the Fisher’s exact test.
The nominal significant value was set to 0.05. Bonferroni adjustment was used
to account for multiple testing.
In-house R and Perl (http://www.perl.org) scripts were used to display
results obtained from the different software packages used.

Figure 1. Inter-specific ML tree indicating the root of all existing SARS-CoV-2
genomes.
Figure 2. Map showing the worldwide spread of the main SARS-CoV-2 clades.
Circle areas are not proportional to frequencies, and the arrows indicate just an
approximate reconstruction of the phylo-dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 for the
beginning of the Asian outbreak to the non-Asian spread of the pathogen based
on meta-data (indicating the sampling origin and dates) and the classification of
genomes into haplogroups according to the phylogeny in Supplementary
Material Figure S4.
Figure 3. (A) Simplified SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (see Supplementary Material
Figure S4 for the complete tree) illustrating the main branches and the main
outbreaks occurring in Asia and outside Asia. The tree also shows the subclades that were mainly founded by a few super-spreaders. (B) EBPS based on
genomes sampled from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of February
2020 (n=621). The orange distribution shows the real number of cases per day
as recorded in https://ourworldindata.org for the same time period (we
disregarded the abnormal peak occurring on 13th February 2020, since more
than 15,000 new cases were reported in China in just one day, most likely
representing not confirmed cases); and (C) Timeline of the main events
occurring during the pandemic, and indicating the MRCA of all SARS-CoV-2
genomes; the dotted area is a schematic representation of the real diversity
values reported in Supplementary Material Figure S2. Divergence dates
between SARS-CoV-2 and bat sarbecovirus reservoir and between bat and
pangolin coronavirus were taken from (Boni et al. 2020).

Table 1. Inter-specific comparisons of sequence identities between different
species, including pangolin (Manis javanica) and bat (Rhinolophus affinis)
against the HQ SARS-CoV-2 dataset. Comparisons involved 3,478 SARS-CoV2 genomes against the coronaviruses indicated in the table. ID refers to identity
number in GISAID (GS; omitting the prefix “EPI-ISL-“) and GenBank (GB).
NC_004718.3 corresponds to the reference SARS Coronavirus genome (Marra
et al. 2003). The genome #402131 corresponds to RaTG13 that has been used
in the literature as bat coronavirus reference. GISAID 414518 and 420923
correspond to coronavirus analyzed from a dog and a tiger (Panthera tigris
jacksoni) that where infected by human SARS-CoV-2. Abbreviations are as
follows: Time: refers to the collection year of the specimen. Dif: Mutational
differences of the coronavirus indicated when compared to the SARS-CoV-2
references sequence (MN908947.3). Id: average identity of the HQ SARS-CoV2 against the corresponding coronavirus in the table. SD: standard deviation of
Dif values. Max and Min: maximum and minimum identities shown by a SARSCoV-2 genome with the other coronaviruses. “N” means ambiguity.
