ABSTRACT

47

initial exposure is imprinted on the immune system, so that a subsequent encounter to the same

48

pathogen or a variant will result in a memory recall response that is often protective. Interrogating

49

the naive B cell repertoire in terms of both abundance and specificity to said pathogen may

50

contribute to an understanding of how to potentially elicit protective responses. Here, we isolated

51

naive B cells across 8 human donors, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD).

52

Single B cell sorting, and subsequent sequence analysis, showed diverse gene usage and pairing

53

with no apparent restriction on complementarity determining region length in either the heavy or

54

light chains. We show that recombinantly expressed IgGs and Fabs of these germline precursors

55

bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Importantly, a subset of these naive antibodies also bind SARS-CoV, an

56

emergent variant (501Y.V2) and a potential pandemic (WIV-1) coronavirus. Furthermore, naive

57

antibodies can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the absence of any somatic

58

hypermutation, suggesting that protective immunity to coronaviruses, more broadly, may be

59

genetically encoded. Future studies aimed at understanding the naive repertoire to other

60

coronaviruses may ultimately reveal shared specificities that could be leveraged to develop pan-

61

coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming encoded germline responses.

Exposure to a pathogen elicits an adaptive immune response aimed to control and eradicate. This

MAIN TEXT

65

Initial exposure to viral antigens by natural infection or vaccination primes an immune response

66

and often establishes an immune memory which can prevent or control future infections. The naive

67

repertoire contains potential B cell receptor (BCR) rearrangements capable of recognizing these

68

antigens, often the surface-exposed glycoproteins. An early step in generating humoral immunity

69

involves activation of these naive B cells through recognition of a cognate antigen (1) which in

70

turn can lead to affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and subsequent

71

differentiation (2). The initial engagement of the naive repertoire begins this cascade and often

72

coincides with the eventual generation of a protective or neutralizing antibody response (3, 4).

73
74

For SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, the development of a neutralizing antibody

75

response after primary infection or vaccination is associated with protection against reinfection in

76

non-human primates (5-8). In humans, the presence of neutralizing antibodies can predict disease

77

severity and survival after primary SARS-CoV-2 infection (9) and correlates with protection from

78

secondary infection (10, 11). Further, memory B cells induced by natural infection in humans may

79

persist and, in some cases, continue to affinity mature for greater than 6 months after primary

80

infection (12-15) providing potentially durable long-term protection. Comparable levels of

81

neutralizing antibody titers were present in convalescent COVID-19 subjects and vaccine

82

recipients (16-18) further supporting the role of adaptive immune responses in helping to control

83

and prevent disease severity. Understanding the origins of these protective responses is critical.

84
85

Both infection- and vaccine-elicited antibodies target the major envelope glycoprotein, spike,

86

present on the virion surface (18). A substantial component of the neutralizing response engages

87

the receptor binding domain (RBD) (19-24) and does so by sterically blocking interactions with

88

the viral receptor ACE2 (25-30). Isolated RBD-directed monoclonal antibodies derive from

89

diverse heavy- and light-chain variable gene segments suggesting that multiple biochemical

90

solutions for developing RBD-directed antibodies are encoded within the human B-cell repertoire

91

(19, 21, 24, 31). Potential immunogenicity of this antigenic site is based on the human naive B cell

92

repertoire, and the overall frequency of naive BCRs that have some level of intrinsic affinity to

93

stimulate their elicitation (32-35); in other words, to reliably amplify a protective SARS-CoV-2

94

response through vaccination or infection, the appropriate naive B cells must be both present (i.e.,

95

precursor frequency) and activatable (i.e., above an affinity threshold). However, antigen-

96

specificity of naive B cells is largely undefined. Here, we characterize the human naive B cell

97

repertoire specific for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD from healthy individuals in order to understand their

98

relative abundance, affinity, and potential for providing a protective (i.e., neutralizing) response

99

after natural infection or vaccination.

100
101

To measure the reactivity of naive human B cells specific for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD we adapted

102

an ex vivo B cell profiling approach used previously to study epitope-specific naive precursors

103

targeting neutralizing sites on HIV (36-38) and influenza virus surface glycoproteins (32). We first

104

designed a SARS-CoV-2 RBD construct that positions two glycans at residues 475 and 501 to

105

selectively block binding to ACE2 and the receptor-binding motif (RBM)-directed antibody, B38

106

(fig. S1) (39). Using this “∆RBM” probe, in addition to wildtype SARS-CoV-2 spike, and RBD

107

probes, we isolated naive (CD19+/IgD+/IgG–) B cells specific to the RBD and, more finely, the

108

RBM from the peripheral blood of 8 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative human donors (Fig. 1A and fig.

109

S2). We defined RBM-specificity as B cells that bound to fluorescently labeled spike and RBD,

110

but not the ∆RBM probe (fig. S3A). Although rare, all 8 donors had detectable populations of

111

RBM-specific naive B cells (fig. S3B). The median frequency of RBM-specific B cells among

112

total and naive B cells was 0.0021% and 0.0023%, respectively (Fig. 1B). Within spike-reactive,

113

naive cells, the median frequency of RBM-specific B cells was 3.2% (Fig. 1C); this potentially

114

suggests that a large proportion of spike epitopes targeted by naive responses reside outside of the

115

RBD. The majority of IgD+ RBM-specific B cells were CD27– (mean frequency ~97%), in

116

agreement with the naive B cell phenotype (fig. S3C).

117
118

To understand in more detail the properties of this naive repertoire, we obtained 163 paired heavy-

119

and light-chain antibody sequences from 5 of the 8 donors (Fig. 1D and fig. S4). Sequence analysis

120

showed that all clones were unique with diverse gene usage for both heavy and light chains and

121

minimal gene pairing preferences (fig. S4). These data reflect the polyclonal gene usage observed

122

in RBD-specific memory B cells sequenced from COVID-19 convalescent individuals (21, 24, 31)

123

and vaccine recipients (18), suggesting that a diverse pool of antibody precursors can be activated

124

upon antigen exposure. In comparing this naive repertoire to gene usage distribution from non-

125

SARS-CoV-2-specific repertoires (40), we observed an increase in mean repertoire frequency of

4

126

~20% for IGHV3-9 in 4 out of 5 sequenced donors (fig. S5A). Notably, this enrichment of IGHV3-

127

9 was also observed in isolated memory B cells from convalescent individuals (41) and vaccine

128

recipients (18), as well as in expanded IgG+ B cells sequenced from a cohort of COVID-19 subjects

129

during acute infection (31). These expanded clones detected shortly after symptom onset displayed

130

low levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) (31), suggesting potential IGHV3-9 usage in an early

131

extrafollicular response in which naive B cells differentiate into short-lived plasma cells (42).

132

Additionally, IGHV3-53 and 3-30 gene segments, over-represented in RBD-specific antibodies

133

isolated from convalescent subjects (22, 30, 43), were recovered from three sequenced donors (13

134

total clones; ~8.0% of total). The amino acid length of heavy and light chain third

135

complementarity-determining regions (CDR3) ranged from 8 to 27 (average length ~16) for

136

HCDR3 and 4 to 13 (average length ~10) for LCDR3 (Fig. 1E). These lengths are normally

137

distributed relative to both unselected human repertoires (40, 44) and RBD-specific memory B

138

cell repertoires (18, 21, 22, 24); this is in contrast to antibody precursors targeting the influenza

139

and HIV receptor binding sites which have strict requirements for length (45) or gene usage (46,

140

47). These data suggest that overall HCDR3 length does not restrict precursor frequency and there

141

appears no inherent bias for CDR3 length conferring RBM-specificity. The majority of obtained

142

sequences were at germline in both the variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains. However, despite

143

sorting B cells with a naive phenotype, some sequences were recovered that deviated from

144

germline. Specifically, the VH ranged from 91.4 to 100% identity to germline, with a median of

145

99.7%; the VL ranged from 93.6 to 100%, with a median of 99.3% (Fig. 1F).

146
147

To obtain affinities of the isolated naive antibodies, we cloned and recombinantly expressed 44

148

IgGs selected to reflect the polyclonal RBD-specific repertoire with representatives from diverse

149

variable region gene segments (Table S1). Additionally, we ensured diversity in terms of HCDR3

150

length, kappa and lambda usage, as well as representation from all 5 donors. By ELISA, we

151

identified IgGs with detectable binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD; we summarize these results for all

152

antibodies (Fig. 2) and parsed by donor (fig. S6A). Across 5 donors, 36 (~81%) bound to

153

monomeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2A) with EC50 values ranging from 3.3 to 410 nM and a

154

mean of 62 nM (Fig. 2B and fig. S6A). These antibodies included 32 unique variable heavy and

155

light chain pairings (Table S1). We further defined the epitopic region of these IgGs using the

156

∆RBM construct and the individual glycan variants, ∆501 and ∆475, both of which independently

157

block ACE2 cell-surface binding but are on opposite sides of the RBM (fig. S1E, F). 11 IgGs had

158

no detectable ∆RBM binding (e.g., ab079, ab119), while 21 IgGs had reduced ELISA binding

159

relative to wild-type RBD (Fig. 2A, B), reflected in the reduced ∆RBM median EC50 values (Fig.

160

2C). We also identified examples of antibodies sensitive to only ∆475 (e.g., ab185) and only ∆501

161

(e.g., ab007) (Fig. 2B and fig. S7). Of the binding population, there is no apparent predisposition

162

for HCDR3 length or light chain pairing (Fig. 2 D, E).

163
164

We next asked whether these antibodies could recognize the SARS CoV-2 variant 501Y.V2

165

currently circulating in South Africa (48). This variant includes a combination of the three RBD

166

mutations: K417N, E484K, and N501Y (48). We find that 22 antibodies (50%) had detectable

167

binding for this variant (Fig. 2B). Interestingly one antibody, ab033, seemed to be specific to this

168

variant and did not bind SARS-CoV-2. We additionally tested the cross-reactivity of these

169

antibodies to both SARS-CoV and WIV-1, related coronaviruses previously circulating and of

170

pandemic potential (49), respectively. While the majority of antibodies (~86%) were specific to

171

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, 5 antibodies were also cross-reactive to both SARS-CoV and WIV-1. Of

172

these cross-reactive antibodies, ab017 and ab114, derives from the same IGHV3-33 and IGVL2-

173

14 paring but were isolated from different donors, suggesting a shared or public clonotype.

174

Additionally, we found that ab189 was uniquely sensitive to the glycan at residue 475; this was

175

surprising given the lack of conservation between of SARS-CoV, CoV-2 and WIV-1 RBMs,

176

despite using the same ACE2 receptor (50). Collectively, these data demonstrate that coronavirus

177

-specific naive antibodies are present in distinct donors, are of unrestricted gene usage and when

178

as expressed as IgGs, have detectable affinity to RBDs from the currently administered vaccines,

179

a circulating variant of concern, and from at least two related viruses.

180
181

To obtain binding kinetics independent of avidity effects from bivalent IgGs, 11 antibodies were

182

selected for expression as Fabs to determine monovalent binding affinity (KDs) by biolayer

183

interferometry (BLI). Using monomeric RBD as the analyte, 9 of the 11 Fabs had detectable

184

binding with KDs ranging from ~6.5 to ~75 µM; the other two remaining Fabs (ab177, ab185),

185

gave unreliable affinity measurements (i.e., >100 µM) (fig. S8). Notably, all Fabs had

186

characteristically fast off rates (koff). This observation is consistent for germline B cells where fast

187

off-rates are compensated by avidity due to overall BCR surface density (51); subsequent affinity

188

gains via somatic hypermutation often result in slowing of the off-rate and is a canonical

189

mechanism of improved antigen binding (52-54). While the biologically relevant antigen affinities

190

of naive B cells are uncertain, recent studies have suggested that B cell activation and affinity

191

maturation is not restricted by immeasurably low affinity BCR interactions (55-57), thus the

192

isolated naive antibodies described here, especially those with demonstrable affinity may very well

193

be engaged and elicited upon antigen exposure.

194
195

We next used a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay (9) to ask whether any of the isolated antibodies

196

were capable of blocking transduction of target cells. We found that of the 36 RBD-binding

197

antibodies tested in this assay, 5 had detectable levels of neutralization (~14%) (Fig. 3A and fig.

198

S9). These neutralizing antibodies, obtained from multiple donors, have few commonalities with

199

respect to their gene usages and HCDR3 lengths (Fig. 3B). While these naive antibodies were not

200

as potent compared to the control antibody B38, isolated from a memory B cell (29), the

201

observation, nevertheless, that the naive repertoire contains antibodies that have, at germline, the

202

potential to neutralize is noteworthy.

203
204

Here, we showed that isolated naive antibodies from 5 different donors can bind SARS-CoV-2

205

RBD and its variant 501Y.V2, a proportion of which are cross-reactive to SARS CoV and WIV-

206

1. These data suggest that RBM-specific precursors may be represented across a substantial

207

fraction of individual human naive repertories. This observation is consistent with longitudinal

208

studies of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals in which the majority of convalescent individuals

209

seroconverted with detectable RBD serum antibodies and neutralization titers (14, 58). A subset

210

of these germline antibodies already shows neutralization activity, albeit weakly, against SARS-

211

CoV-2 pseudoviruses. They therefore have the potential to affinity mature into more potent

212

neutralizing antibodies after vaccination or natural infection. Indeed, recent studies have

213

characterized potent RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies with a limited level of somatic

214

hypermutation (19, 21, 24, 31, 59). The naive antibodies characterized here engage epitopes across

215

the RBM with a range of angles of approach as defined by our glycan variant probes; this is

216

consistent with other RBD-targeting antibodies characterized by epitope-mapping, deep

217

mutational scanning and structures (25, 27, 60) (Fig. 4). Having BCRs within the naive repertoire

218

that recognize distinct or partially overlapping epitopes across the RBM may be advantageous in

219

eliciting protective responses to variants of SARS-CoV-2 (61-64). Collectively, our observations

220

described here for SARS-CoV-2 are notably in contrast to other viruses such as HIV, whose

221

germline precursors targeting its receptor binding site lack demonstrable affinity, are highly

222

restricted in their gene usages and cannot at germline neutralize the virus (65-67). Future

223

investigations aimed at understanding the naive repertoire with respect to coronaviruses of

224

pandemic potential may reveal further commonalties in antigen-specific precursors, enabling the

225

development of pan-coronavirus vaccines aimed at priming specific germline responses of

226

protective potential.

METHODS

229

Donor Samples

230

PBMCs were isolated from blood donors obtained from the MGH blood donor center (8 donors

231

total). Prior to donating blood, subjects were required to sign a donor attestation/consent statement,

232

as per hospital requirements, stating ‘‘I give permission for my blood to be used for transfusion to

233

patients or for research’’. The gender and age are not recorded, however eligible donors are of at

234

least 16 years old and weigh a minimum of 110lbs. All experiments were conducted with MGH

235

Institutional Biosafety Committee approval (MGH protocol 2014B000035). Isolated PBMCs were

236

used for B cell enrichment and single cell sorting (described below); plasma was aliquoted and

237

stored at -80 ºC until further use. Additionally, the control convalescent sera used for ELISA was

238

obtained under the approved Partners Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020P000895) for use

239

of patient samples for the development and validation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests (9).

240
241

Expression and purification of recombinant CoV Antigens

242

Plasmids encoding the receptor binding domains (RBDs) were designed based on GenBank

243

sequences MN975262.1 (SARS-CoV-2), ABD72970.1 (SARS-CoV), and AGZ48828.1 (WIV-1).

244

Constructs were codon optimized and synthesized by IDT. Glycosylation sites at SARS-CoV-2

245

RBD residues 501 and/or 475 as well as 501Y.V2 mutations (K417N/E484K/N501Y) were

246

inserted by QuikChange Mutagenesis (Agilent) following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol

247

and were sequence confirmed (Genwiz). SARS-CoV-2 spike contained a C-terminal foldon

248

trimerization domain and HRV 3C-cleavable 6xHis and 2xStrep II tags (68). All proteins were

249

transiently expressed in Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher). 5 to 7 days post-transfection, supernatants

250

were harvested by centrifugation and further purified using immobilized metal affinity

251

chromatography (IMAC) with cobalt-TALON resin (Takara) followed by Superdex 200 Increase

252

10/300 GL size exclusion column (GE Healthcare).

253
254

Expression and purification IgGs and Fabs

255

IgG and Fab genes for the heavy- and light-chain variable domains were synthesized and codon

256

optimized by IDT and subcloned into pVRC protein expression vectors and sequence confirmed

257

(Genewiz). Fabs and IgGs were similarly expressed and purified as described above for RBDs.

258

IgGs were buffer exchanged into PBS while Fabs were concentrated and further purified by

259

Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL size exclusion column.

260
261

ELISA

262

Both sera and monoclonal antibody reactivity to CoV antigens were assayed by ELISA. Briefly,

263

96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 5 µg/ml of monomeric RBDs diluted in PBS and

264

incubated overnight at 4ºC. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS containing 1% Tween-20

265

(PBS-T) for 1hr at room temperature (RT). Blocking solution was discarded and 4-fold serial

266

dilutions of human plasma (1:20 starting dilution) or isolated monoclonal antibodies (150 µg/ml

267

starting concentration) in PBS were added to wells and incubated for 1hr at RT. Plates were then

268

washed three times with PBS-T. Secondary, anti-human IgG-HRP (Abcam), was added to each

269

well at 1:20,000 dilution in PBS-T and incubated for 1hr at RT. Plates were then washed three

270

times with PBS-T and developed with 1-Step ABTS substrate (ThermoFisher) per manufacturer

271

recommendations. Absorbance was measured using a plate reader at 405nm. EC50 values were

272

determined for monoclonal antibodies by non-linear regression (sigmoidal) using GraphPad Prism

273

8.4.3 software. (GraphPad Software). ELISAs against 501Y.V2, SARS-CoV and WIV-1 RBDs

274

were done at a single IgG concentration (150 µg/ml) in replicate. Positive binding was defined by

275

an OD405 ≥ 0.30.

ACE-2 cell binding assay

278

ACE-2 expressing 293T cells were incubated with 200 nM of RBD antigen in PBS for 1hr on ice.

279

Cells were resuspended in 50µL of secondary stain containing streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen) at a

280

1:200 dilution and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cell binding was analyzed by flow cytometry using

281

a Stratedigm S1300Exi Flow Cytometer equipped with a 96 well plate high throughput sampler.

Rsulting data were analyzed using FlowJo (10.7.1).

Probe Generation

285

SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ∆RBM constructs were expressed as dimeric murine-Fc (mFc; IgG1)

286

fusion proteins containing a HRV 3C-cleavable C-terminal 8xHis and SBP tags and purified as

287

described above. SBP-tagged RBD- and ∆RBM-mFc dimers were individually mixed with

288

fluorescently labeled streptavidin, SA-BV650 and SA-BV786 (BioLegend), to form RBD-mFc-

289

BV650 and ∆RBM-mFc-BV786 tetramers. SARS-CoV-2 spike with a C-terminal Strep II tag was

290

labeled separately with StrepTactin PE and APC (IBA) to form spike-PE and -APC tetramers,

291

respectively. Both labeling steps were performed for 30 min at 4 ºC prior to sorting.

292
293

Single B Cell Sorting

294

Naive B cells were purified from PBMCs using the MACS Human B Cell isolation kit (Miltenyi

295

Biotec) and incubated with 25nM of each SARS-CoV-2 probe (RBD-mFc-BV650, ∆RBM-mFc-

296

BV786, spike-PE, and spike-APC) for 30 min at 4ºC. Cells were stained with anti-human CD19

297

(Alexa-700), CD3 (PerCP-Cy5), IgD (PE-Cy7), IgG (BV711), CD27 (BV510), LiveDead Violet

298

(Invitrogen), and Calcien (Invitrogen) for an additional 30 min. RBM-specific naive B cells,

299

defined as CD19+/CD3-/IgG-/IgD+/spike PE+/spike APC+/RBD+/∆RBM--, were single-cell sorted

300

using BD FACS Aria II (BD Biosciences) into 96-well plates containing lysis buffer supplemented

301

with 1% BME. Within the CD19+/IgG–/IgD+ gated cells, we also confirmed that 97% of the events

302

were CD27 negative. Plates were stored at -80 ºC for subsequent analysis. Flow cytometry data

303

was analyzed using FlowJo software version 10.7.1.

306

BCR Sequencing was carried out as described previously (32). Briefly, whole transcriptome

307

amplification (WTA) was performed on the sorted cell-lysates according to the Smart-Seq2

308

protocol (69). We then amplified heavy and light chain sequences from the WTA products utilizing

309

pools of partially degenerate pools of V region specific primers (Qiagen HotStar Taq Plus). Heavy

310

and light chain amplifications were carried out separately, with each pool containing pooled

311

primers against human IGHV and heavy chain constant region genes, or human IGLV, IGKV, and

312

light chain constant region genes. Cellular barcodes and index adapters (based on Nextera XT

313

Index Adapters, Illumina Inc.) were added using a step-out PCR method. Amplicons were then

314

pooled and sequenced using a 250x250 paired end 8x8 index reads on an Illumina Miseq System.

315

The data were then demultiplexed, heavy and light chain reads were paired, and overlapping

316

sequence reads were obtained (Panda-Seq) (70) and aligned against the human IMGT database

317

(71).

318
319

Interferometry binding experiments

320

Interferometry experiments were performed using a BLItz instrument (ForteBio). Fabs (0.1 mg/ml)

321

were immobilized on Ni-NTA biosensors. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD analyte was titrated (10µM,

322

5µM, 2.5µM, and 1µM) to acquire binding affinities; the KD was obtained through global fit of the

323

titration curves by applying a 1:1 binding isotherm using vendor-supplied software.

324
325

Pseudotyped Neutralization Assay

326

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was assessed using lentiviral particles pseudotyped as previously

327

described (9, 72). Briefly, lentiviral particles were produced via transient transfection of 293T

328

cells. The titers of viral supernatants were determined via flow cytometry on 293T-ACE2 cells

329

(72) and via the HIV-1 p24CA antigen capture assay (Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.). Assays

330

were performed in 384-well plates (Grenier) using a Fluent Automated Workstation (Tecan). IgGs

331

starting at 150 µg/ml, were serially diluted (3-fold) in 20µL followed by addition of 20 µL of

332

pseudovirus containing 250 infectious units and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Finally,

333

10,000 293T-ACE2 cells (72) in 20 µL cell media containing 15 µg/ml polybrene were added to

334

each well and incubated at 37 °C for 60-72 hrs. Following transduction, cells were lysed using a

335

previously described assay buffer (73) and shaken for 5 min prior to quantitation of luciferase

336

expression using a Spectramax L luminometer (Molecular Devices). Percent neutralization was
