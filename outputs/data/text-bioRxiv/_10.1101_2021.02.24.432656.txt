ABSTRACT

39

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the coronavirus

40

disease 2019 pandemic. ORF6 is known to antagonize the interferon signaling by inhibiting the nuclear

41

translocation of STAT1. Here we show that ORF6 acts as a virulence factor through two distinct strategies. First,

42

ORF6 directly interacts with STAT1 in an IFN-independent manner to inhibit its nuclear translocation. Second,

43

ORF6 directly binds to importin α1, which is a nuclear transport factor encoded by KPNA2, leading to a

44

significant suppression of importin α1-mediated nuclear transport. Furthermore, we found that KPNA2 knockout

45

enhances the viral replication, suggesting that importin α1 suppresses the viral propagation. Additionally, the

46

analyses of gene expression data revealed that importin α1 levels decreased significantly in the lungs of older

47

individuals. Taken together, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 disrupts the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking to accelerate the

48

viral replication, resulting in the disease progression, especially in older individuals.

INTRODUCTION

50

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

51

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is a single-strand RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family 1, 2, 3.

52

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is approximately 29.7 kb long with short untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5’ and

53

3’ termini, and encodes nonstructural (nsp1-16), structural (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and

54

nucleocapsid [N]), and accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10) 4, 5.

55

Among them, ORF6 is a small protein of approximately 7 kDa, which consists of 61 amino acids and

56

exhibits a 69% homology with the SARS-CoV ORF6, from which it differs due to a two amino acids deletion

57

at the C-terminus 6. Several studies have recently shown that both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ORF6

58

proteins antagonize the host innate immune system via the Janus activated kinase 1 (JAK1)- and JAK2-signal

59

transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. STAT1 is a key mediator of cytokine-induced gene

60

expression as it is activated by cytokines including type I and type II interferons (IFNs) 11, 12. Activation of JAKs

61

associated with type I IFN receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (PY-STAT1), leading to

62

the formation of a STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer, while Type I interferon (IFN-α or -β) and type II interferon

63

(IFN-γ) induce the formation of the PY-STAT1 homodimers. Both the hetero- and homo-dimer STAT1

64

complexes translocate to the nucleus to bind the IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) or IFN-γ-activated

65

site (GAS) 11, 12. Previous studies indicated that ORF6 inhibits the nuclear transport of PY-STAT1 to suppress

66

the primary interferon signaling 7, 8, 9, 10, 13.

67

Constitutive and signal-dependent protein transports through the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs)

68

embedded in the nuclear envelope are mediated by members of the importin (also known as karyopherin)

69

superfamily 14, 15, 16, 17. The process of protein import into the nucleus commonly involves the recognition of a

70

classical nuclear localization signal (cNLS) by the importin α/β1 heterodimer 18, 19. Cargos containing the cNLS

71

are recognized by the adaptor molecule importin α (also known as karyopherin α: KPNA). Following the cNLS-

72

containing cargo/importin α/β1 trimeric complex entrance into the nucleus through the NPCs, the cargo is

73

released from importin α by binding of GTP-bound small GTPase Ran (RanGTP) to importin β1 18, 19, 20. After

74

the complex dissociation, importin α is exported to the cytoplasm by cellular apoptosis susceptibility gene

75

product (CAS, also known as CSE1L) with RanGTP, and the importin β1/RanGTP complex also returns to the

76

cytoplasm, where it is reused for the next rounds of transport 14, 20.

77

Seven importin α proteins have been identified in humans, while six have been discovered in mice 17,

78

20, 21

79

In humans, clade 1 consists of importin α5 (encoded by the KPNA1 gene), importin α6 (KPNA5), and importin

80

α7 (KPNA6). Clade 2 consists of importin α1 (KPNA2) and importin α8 (KPNA7), and clade 3 consists of

81

importin α3 (KPNA4) and importin α4 (KPNA3) 20. The members of each subfamily display the cargo specificity

82

and are differentially expressed in different tissues and cell types 20, 21, 22, 23. Differences in the usage of “importin

83

α” or “KPNA” and the number of proteins in humans have often caused confusion. Therefore, in this study, we

84

uniformly use the human nomenclature for “importin α” to refer to the protein and use the italic term “KPNA”

85

to refer to the gene, while the normal term “KPNA” is described according to the way in which it is used in the

86

citation.

. Based on the sequence similarity, each importin α protein is assigned to one of three conserved subfamilies.

87

It has already been demonstrated that the nuclear transport of the PY-STAT1 as a homodimer or a

88

heterodimer with STAT2 is mediated by specific clade 1 subtypes of importin α such as importin α5/KPNA1 24,

89

25, 26, 27

90

SARS-CoV ORF6 has been reported to tether KPNA2, but not KPNA1, to ER to sequester importin β1 into

91

endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi apparatus, resulting in the suppression of nuclear import of PY-STAT1 7.

92

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 has also been shown to interact with KPNA2

93

KPNA2 9, further supporting its interference with the nuclear transport of PY-STAT1. On the other hamd,

94

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 was shown to interact with the Nup98-RAE1 (NPC components) complex

95

achieve the nuclear exclusion of STAT1 by binding to the Nup98-RAE1 complex rather than binding to importin

. According to the several studies on the viral proteins that inhibit the nuclear transport of PY-STAT1,

5

10

as well as both KPNA1 and

28

, and to

96

α proteins 9. However, the exact molecular mechanism of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 on the

97

nucleocytoplasmic trafficking remains largely unknown.

98

In this study, therefore, we characterized the function of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 on the

99

nucleocytoplasmic protein transport. First of all, we examined the subcellular localization of ORF6 protein in

100

cells infected with distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains using originally established antibodies, and also demonstrated

101

that ORF6 functions as a virulence factor for COVID-19 using a hamster model and a newly produced replicon

102

system. Furthermore, we found that ORF6 directly binds to STAT1 to suppress the IFN-induced nuclear

103

localization and the nuclear shuttling in the absence of IFN-stimulation. In addition, the direct binding of ORF6

104

to importin α1 significantly reduces the cNLS-cargo transport, indicating that ORF6 influences importin α1

105

independently of STAT1. We also found that the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced in KPNA2

106

knockout cells, suggesting that importin α1 acts for the suppression of viral propagation. Lastly, the analyses of

107

datasets from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project indicated that the expression of importin α1

108

significantly decreases in the lungs of older individuals, suggesting that the importin α1 levels might be related

109

to the expansion of the COVID-19 illness. Thus, our results suggest that ORF6 plays a critical role in SARS-

110

CoV-2 replication by disrupting the importin α-mediated nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking.

RESULTS

112

ORF6 contributes to viral RNA replication and pathogenicity in vivo

113

To assess the ORF6 expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we first established an ORF6 specific antibody,

114

and examined the protein in cells infected with different viral strains which were obtained from the National

115

Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Japan, Hong Kong (HK)/VM20001061, USA-CA2, Germany/BavPat1,

116

New York (NY)-PV09197, NY-PV08410, and NY-PV08449 (Fig. 1A). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis

117

indicated that ORF6 was localized in the cytoplasm of the SARS-CoV-2 infected VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (Fig.

118

1B), which is consistent with the previous observation in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells 29.

119

Next, we tried to know the roles of ORF6 in the viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. For this, the viral

120

genome encoding ORF6 was replaced by that of NanoLuc, and a SARS-CoV-2 variant that does not express

121

ORF6 (SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6) was generated using the circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER). As a

122

parental virus, a recombinant virus expressing ORF6 fused with NanoLuc (NLuc) and Porcine teschovirus 2A

123

peptide (SARS-CoV-2/NLuc2AORF6, Fig. S1) was generated. The deletion of ORF6 in SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6

124

was confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 1C). To assess the viral growth in Huh7-ACE2 cells, these recombinant

125

viruses were inoculated at a MOI = 0.1, and then the viral RNA was determined from the culture supernatant.

126

The viral RNA in the supernatant of cells infected with SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6 was significantly decreased (Fig.

127

1D).

128

Next, to evaluate the function of ORF6 in vivo, the parental virus (WT SARS-CoV-2) or SARS-CoV-

129

2/ΔORF6 was intranasally inoculated in 4-week-old hamsters. Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6

130

showed significant weight gain 5 days post-infection, whereas those infected with the WT virus showed no

131

significant change in the body weight (Fig. 1E). In addition, 5 days post-infection, the viral RNA was

132

significantly reduced in the lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6 compared to those infected with the

133

WT virus (Fig. 1F). Immunohistological analyses revealed that the viral nucleoprotein (NP) was expressed at

134

lower levels in the lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6 than in those infected with the WT virus (Fig.

135

1G). These data suggest that ORF6 is involved in the viral replication and pathogenesis of COVID-19 in vivo.

136
137

ORF6 inhibits the nuclear localization of STAT1 following the IFN stimulation

138

Several studies have already shown that ORF6 inhibits the nuclear localization of STAT1 in response to type-I

139

IFN (IFN-α or -β) stimulation

140

ORF6 on a type-II IFN (IFN-γ)-activated STAT1. The AcGFP fused ORF6 was transfected into HeLa cells, and

141

the subcellular localization of PY-STAT1 was observed when the cells were stimulated with either IFN-β or

142

IFN-γ. While the PY-STAT1 was localized in the nucleus of AcGFP-transfected cells in response to each

143

treatment, the distribution was markedly shifted to the cytoplasm in the AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells (Fig.

144

2A, B). The fluorescence intensity ratio of the nucleus against the whole cells further supported the significant

145

nuclear exclusion of the PY-STAT1 in the AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells when stimulated by IFN-γ (Fig. 2C).

146

Next, in order to confirm that the PY-STAT1 is excluded from the nucleus by ORF6, we evaluated the

147

expression of PY-STAT1 downstream genes using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). In comparison to the

148

AcGFP-transfected control cells, the AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells showed significant down-regulation of

149

IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) 30 mRNA 6 h post-transfection or later upon stimulation (Fig. 2D). To clarify

150

whether the nuclear exclusion of PY-STAT1 by ORF6 affects the expression of the IFN-stimulated response

151

element (ISRE)-containing gene, a luciferase assay was performed in Huh7 cells. The cells were transfected

152

with a luciferase reporter plasmid including ISRE together with AcGFP or AcGFP-ORF6. We observed a

153

significant repression of the relative luciferase values in the AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells compared to that

154

of AcGFP-transfected cells (Fig. 2E). Finally, we confirmed that the relative ISRE luciferase value was

155

significantly suppressed when the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were stimulated by IFN-γ (Fig. 2F). These results

156

indicate that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 suppresses the nuclear translocation of PY-STAT1 to inhibit the activation of

157

STAT1-downstream genes.

. Here, we attempted to verify the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2

158
159

The C-terminal region of ORF6 aids the acceleration of viral replication

160

Previously, the C-terminal region of ORF6 was shown to be involved in the inhibition of IFN response 8. Hence,

161

in line with the previous findings, we validated the effects of ORF6 C-terminal mutations on the nuclear

162

translocation of PY-STAT1. As a result, we found that the ORF6 mutant with alanine replacing amino acids 49

163

to 52 (referred to as ORF6-M1) retained the inhibitory effect over PY-STAT1, while the other mutants with

164

alanine replacing amino acids 53 to 55 (ORF6-M2) and 56 to 61 (ORF6-M3) did not retain their inhibitory

165

functions (Fig. 3A-C).

166

To further assess the function of ORF6 in viral propagation, we established a replicon system in which

167

we can evaluate the viral replication process by detecting the Renilla luciferase (RLuc) (Fig. 3D). The replicon

168

plasmid was transfected together with AcGFP or AcGFP-ORF6 in Huh7 cells and the RLuc values were

169

analyzed 24 h post-transfection. We found that the expression of WT ORF6 and ORF6-M1, but not ORF6-M2

170

and ORF6-M3, significantly enhanced the viral replication (Fig. 3E), consistent with the effects on STAT1

171

nuclear localization. These results suggest that the C-terminal regions (amino acids 53 to 61) of ORF6 plays an

172

important role to inhibit the interferon signaling by disrupting the nuclear localization of PY-STAT1, resulting

173

in the enhancement of the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2.

174
175

ORF6 directly binds to STAT1 in an IFN-independent manner

176

Next, in order to characterize the interplay between ORF6 and STAT1 in more detail, we analyzed the

177

subcellular distribution of Flag-tagged STAT1 in AcGFP-ORF6-transfected HeLa cells. In addition to the WT

178

ORF6, the in-frame 9 amino acids deletion mutant (loss of amino acids 22 to 30; referred to as ORF6Δ9) which

179

were reported in the previous works

180

was mainly localized in the cytoplasm in either AcGFP-, AcGFP-ORF6- or AcGFP-ORF6Δ9-transfected cells

181

(Fig. 4A, B). Upon IFN-γ stimulation, Flag-STAT1 was distributed into the nucleus in the AcGFP-transfected

31, 32

was also examined. Under non-stimulated conditions, Flag-STAT1

182

cells. In contrast, it was retained in the cytoplasm in AcGFP-ORF6 WT- and Δ9-transfected cells (Fig. 4C, D).

183

Interestingly, statistical analysis revealed that even under non-stimulated conditions, the cytoplasmic intensities

184

of Flag-STAT1 were significantly higher in the AcGFP-ORF6 WT- or Δ9-transfected cells compared to those

185

observed in the AcGFP-transfected control cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that STAT1 may shuttle between the

186

nucleus and the cytoplasm in the absence of IFN stimulation and be trapped in the cytoplasm by ORF6.

187

Therefore, to address the possibility of the interaction between ORF6 and non-activated STAT1, we

188

first performed an immunoprecipitation assay using AcGFP-ORF6 (HA-ORF6)- and Flag-STAT1-transfected

189

cells. As a result, we found that HA-ORF6 was precipitated with Flag-STAT1 in the absence of IFN stimulation

190

(Fig. 4E). Next, to know whether ORF6 directly binds to STAT1, bacterially purified recombinant STAT1

191

protein was incubated with either recombinant GST-GFP or recombinant GST-GFP fused ORF6 full-length

192

protein (GST-GFP-ORF6). Fig. 4F showed that STAT1 was directly bound to GST-GFP-ORF6. To address

193

whether the binding of ORF6 to STAT1 is mediated by the amino acids 49-61 in the C-terminal region (referred

194

to as M0 in this study, see Fig. 3A), we produced a recombinant protein consisting of the 13 amino acids (M0)

195

which was fused to GST and GFP (GST-M0-GFP). As shown in Fig. 4G, the pull-down assay clearly revealed

196

that STAT1 was bound to the GST-M0-GFP protein. Taken together, we conclude that ORF6 directly binds to

197

STAT1 through the C-terminus in the absence of IFN stimulation, meaning that ORF6 binds to the resting state

198

of STAT1 in the cytoplasm.

199
200

ORF6 alters the subcellular distribution of importin α proteins

201

Previous studies showed that the SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-associated inhibition of nuclear translocation

202

of STAT1 is accomplished through the interaction between ORF6 and importin α1/KPNA2 7, 10. However, as

203

described above, ORF6 binds directly to STAT1 in the absence of IFN stimulation in the cytoplasm, which

204

raises a possibility that the binding of ORF6 to importin α proteins might not be required to inhibit the nuclear

205

accumulation of STAT1. Therefore, we attempted to examine the interplay between the ORF6 and importin α
10

206

proteins. Since ORF6 has been shown to alter the distribution of importin α1/KPNA2 and/or importin

207

α5/KPNA1 7, 9, we first validated these findings concerning all human importin α subtypes. Consistent with the

208

previous reports, in AcGFP-transfected cells (control), the overexpressed Flag-importin α proteins were mainly

209

localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, B, Fig. S2). In contrast, in AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells, the localization of

210

Flag-importin α1, α3, α4, α6, and α8 remarkably changed to the cytoplasm, while Flag-importin α5 and α7 were

211

still mostly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, B, Fig. S2). The analysis of nuclear fluorescence intensities ratio

212

clearly showed that in AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells, the nuclear distribution of Flag-importin α1 was

213

drastically shifted to the cytoplasm, while the Flag-importin α5 was mainly retained in the nucleus (Fig. 5C).

214

These data indicate that ORF6 has distinct effects on each importin α subtype.

215
216

Importin α1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the presence of ORF6

217

Next, we examined whether ORF6 directly binds to importin α proteins. Purified recombinant GST-GFP-ORF6

218

was incubated with Flag-importin α1 or Flag-importin α5, respectively, and then the GST-proteins were pulled-

219

down using glutathione Sepharose beads to know whether the Flag-importin α proteins were co-precipitated or

220

not. Using western blotting, we identified that Flag-importin α1, but not Flag-importin α5, mainly binds to

221

ORF6 (Fig. 5D).

222

Direct binding of ORF6 to importin α1 suggest a possibility that ORF6 may inhibit the mobility of

223

importin α1 to tether it in the cytoplasm, as reported previously with SARS-CoV ORF6 7. Therefore, we next

224

tried to know whether importin α1 moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus even in the presence of ORF6. For

225

this, we focused on the characteristic feature of importin α1 that it accumulates in the nucleus in response to

226

cellular stresses such as oxidative stress 33, 34. That is, it has been clearly demonstrated that while in unstressed

227

cells importin α1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, in stressed cells importin α1 accumulates in

228

the nucleus due to the inhibition of RanGTP-dependent nuclear export of importin α by a collapse in the RanGTP

229

gradient 33, 34. Therefore, we speculated that if importin α1 cannot move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus by
11

230

ORF6, we cannot observe its nuclear accumulation under stress conditions. Hence, HeLa cells were transfected

231

with AcGFP-ORF6 and Flag-importin α1 and treated with 200 μM of H2O2 for 1 h. Unexpectedly, we found

232

that under the oxidative stress conditions, Flag-importin α1 was localized into the nucleus in the ORF6-

233

transfected cells (Fig. 5E, F). The same phenomenon was also observed for endogenous importin α1 (Fig. S3A-

234

C). Thus, these results mean that although importin α1 seems to be tethered in the cytoplasm in the ORF6-

235

transfected cells, it retains its original capacity to move between the nucleus and the cytoplasm even in the

236

ORF6-transfected cells. Taken together with the results that the subcellular localization of neither importin β1

237

nor CAS, the export factor for importin α, was dramatically altered in the ORF6-transfected cells (Fig. S3D, E),

238

it is most likely that the nuclear exclusion of STAT1 by ORF6 is not due to the cytoplasmic tethering of importin

239

α1.

240
241

ORF6 negatively regulates the importin α/β1 pathway

242

As described above, since we found that ORF6 directly binds to importin α1, we next tried to know whether

243

ORF6 directly affects the importin α1-mediated nuclear transport pathway or not. For this, HeLa cells were

244

transfected with mCherry fused SV40T-NLS (mCherry-NLS) together with AcGFP or AcGFP-ORF6, and then

245

the nuclear intensities of the fluorescent substrate were measured. Although the majority of mCherry-NLS was

246

observed in the nucleus of AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells, its cytoplasmic proportion was significantly

247

increased compared to that observed in the AcGFP-transfected control cells (Fig. 6A, B).

248

Next, we compared the binding ability of importin α1 to the cNLS-containing cargo (GST-NLS-GFP)

249

and ORF6 (GST-GFP-ORF6). The GST pull-down assay showed that importin α1 more efficiently interacted

250

with cNLS than ORF6 (Fig. 6C). To assess the inhibitory effects of ORF6 on the importin α/β1-mediated nuclear

251

transport of GST-NLS-mRFP, a digitonin-permeabilized semi-intact nuclear transport assay was performed. As

252

a result, we observed that the addition of excess amounts of ORF6 significantly inhibited the nuclear

253

translocation of the cNLS-cargo (Fig. 6D, E), suggesting that ORF6 affects the importin α/β1 pathway, when it

254

exists in large quantities in cells.

255

To further investigate the effects of ORF6 on other important signaling pathways mediated by importin

256

α/β1 other than STAT1, we focused on the following signaling molecules, hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-

257

1α) and Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) component p65/RelA, since they have been shown to be transported

258

into the nucleus by several importin α proteins 35, 36, 37. First, HeLa cells were transfected with AcGFP or AcGFP-

259

ORF6, and then treated with 200 M cobalt chloride (CoCl2) for 5 h to induce the nuclear accumulation of HIF-

260

1α. On the other hand, the nuclear migration of NF-κB p65 was investigated using AcGFP- or AcGFP-ORF6-

261

transfected cells treated with 20 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for 30 min. As a result, the nuclear

262

accumulations of both of HIF-1α (Fig. 6F, G) and NF-κB p65 (Fig. 6H, I) were significantly suppressed in the

263

AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells. Notably, the inhibitory effects of ORF6 on these two importin α/β1-mediated

264

signaling molecules were reduced compared to that on STAT1. These results totally suggest that the SARS-

265

CoV-2 might negatively regulate the importin α/β1-mediated protein trafficking into the nucleus through the

266

moderate binding of ORF6 to importin α1.

267
268

Knockout of KPNA2 enhances the replication of SARS-CoV-2

269

Since importin α1 might be one of the target molecules for SARS-CoV-2 ORF6, we further examined the roles

270

of importin α1 on the propagation of SARS-CoV-2. The KPNA2 gene, which encodes importin α1, was knocked

271

out in Huh7-ACE2 cells using a single-guide RNA (sgKPNA2), and then the knockout (KO) cells were infected

272

by SARS-CoV-2. After 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection, the viral RNA levels and viral titer were measured using

273

the culture supernatant. Both viral RNA levels and viral titer significantly increased in the KPNA2 KO cells 24

274

h following infection (Fig. 6J, K). These results suggest that importin α1 plays a suppressive function on the

275

SARS-CoV-2 replication and that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 might attenuate the function of importin α1 to achieve

276

an efficient viral propagation.

Global analysis for KPNA2 in different tissues and at different ages

279

To further understand the role of the importin α1 in the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and ultimately the COVID-

280

19 pandemic, we assessed whether the patients’ importin α1 expression profiles are associated with COVID-19

281

symptoms. Using the GTEx dataset, we analyzed whether the importin α1 expression level in lung tissues and

282

whole blood cells, with sexes as well as across age is correlated with symptoms using the European ancestry

283

(EUR) samples. We found that the importin α1 levels significantly decreased with ages in lung tissues (Fig. 7A)

284

and that the tendency was associated with males rather than female (Fig. 7B). On the other hand, the expression

285

levels in whole blood increased in an age-dependent manner in both sexes (Fig. 7C, D). We also found that the

286

KPNA2 expression levels in the lungs were significantly lower in Asian ancestry than those in European, African,

287

and other ancestries (Fig. S5). These data suggest that the low expression level of importin α1 in the lungs might

288

represent a COVID-19-associated concern observed in older patients, particularly for males, and be one of the

289

risk factors for infection of SARS-CoV-2.

DISCUSSION

291

In this study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 plays an important role in viral replication and

292

pathogenesis of COVID-19 in vivo. In addition, we discovered that ORF6 acts on the nucleocytoplasmic

293

signaling via two distinct ways. That is, first, ORF6 inhibits the nuclear translocation of one of the key signaling

294

molecules for COVID-19, STAT1, through its direct binding to antagonize the IFN signaling. Second, ORF6

295

directly affects the function of importin α to impair the nuclear transportation of cNLS-containing cargos

296

including signaling molecules such as HIF-1α and NF-κB p65.

297

A previous study reported that SARS-CoV ORF6 tethered importin α1/KPNA2, but not importin

298

α5/KPNA1, to the ER and, as a result, sequestered importin β1 into the ER/Golgi segment through the

299

interaction with importin α1, resulting in the inhibition of PY-STAT1 nuclear import 7. Since the nuclear

300

transport of PY-STAT1 is known to be mediated by importin α5/KPNA1 24, 25 and we showed here that importin

301

α1 can enter the nucleus even in the presence of ORF6 under oxidative stress conditions, it is unlikely that

302

SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 tethers importin α1 to the ER to cause the nuclear exclusion of STAT1.

303

In contrast, we found that the Flag-STAT1 was more abundantly localized in the cytoplasm in the

304

absence of IFN stimulation in the ORF6-transfected cells than in the control WT cells (Fig. 4A, B). It was

305

previously demonstrated that unphosphorylated STAT1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and

306

this shuttling might play an important role in regulating the expression of IFN stimulated genes

307

Moreover, in this study, we found that the bacterially purified STAT1 proteins, which are not phosphorylated,

308

binds to ORF6. Since the phosphorylation of STAT1 has been shown to be unaffected by ORF6 upon the IFN

309

stimulation

310

manner. Collectively, we propose a scenario that the nuclear exclusion of STAT1 is caused by the direct binding

311

with ORF6 independently of importin α proteins.

12, 38, 39, 40

.

8, 10

, the interaction between ORF6 and STAT1 might occur in a phosphorylation-independent

312

On the other hands, we found that the subcellular localizations of all importin α subtypes were altered

313

in ORF6-transfected cells, suggesting a possibility that ORF6 directly or indirectly influences the importin α/β115

314

mediated nuclear transport pathways. Consistent with this possibility, we further found that the nuclear

315

accumulation of the mCherry-NLS substrate was significantly reduced in the AcGFP-ORF6-transfected cells.

316

In addition, using the semi-intact nuclear transport assay, we demonstrated that the addition of ORF6 inhibits

317

the nuclear transportation of GST-NLS-mRFP. Furthermore, we found that ORF6 negatively regulates the

318

nuclear import of HIF-1α and NF-κB p65, which have been already shown to be mediated by importin α proteins

319

antiviral immune signaling without affecting cell survival to develop COVID-19.

. Since the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is vital for cell survival, SARS-CoV-2, therefore, should avoid

321

Recently, it has been shown that the specific interaction of ORF6 with the NPC components, Nup98

322

and Rae1, might disrupt the nuclear transport 9, 28, 41. Consistently, it has been already known that the hijacking

323

of the NPC components suppresses the host mRNA export system

324

supporting evidence that the arginine substitution at residue 58 of ORF6 abolishes its IFN antagonistic function

325

9

326

which contains a methionine amino acid at the 58 position. Furthermore, we found that this C-terminal region

327

of ORF6 plays a critical role in altering the subcellular localization of importin α1. Taken together, we propose

328

that the ORF6 negatively regulates the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking through the binding with importin α1 and

329

some NPC components. Considering that various mutations and deletions have been found in ORF6 31, 42, further

330

studies will be required to understand how ORF6, especially its C-terminus region functions for the viral

331

infection in order to utilize it as a therapeutic target.

41

. Moreover, Miorin et al. provided a

. In this study, we demonstrated that STAT1 binds to ORF6 via the residues 49-61 from the C-terminus (M0)

332

Consistently, we found that the viral propagation of SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced in KPNA2 KO cells. In

333

addition, the GTEx dataset revealed that the KPNA2 levels in lung tissue significantly decrease with the

334

advancement in age, and that this decrease is more remarkable in males than in females. Moreover, the another

335

GTEx analysis indicated that the levels of KPNA2 in the lungs tend to be lower in Asians than in other genetic

336

ancestries, although further data need to be required to make a definite conclusion, since the sample size for the

337

Asian group is smaller than that of the other groups. Since hypoxia has been recognized as a pathogenic factor

338

in COVID-19 patients 43, 44, we suspect that ORF6 might impair the nuclear import of HIF-1α, which is required

339

for the response to hypoxia, to affect lung cell functions in the COVID-19 patients, so that the lung oxygen

340

levels cannot be maintained appropriately. Thus, the downregulation of importin α1 may accelerate the

341

replication of the virus in the lungs, in particular in older individuals. In conclusion, we propose that in the lungs

342

of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 exhibits dual effects on the viral proliferation by inhibiting the STAT1

343

signaling and negatively regulating the importin α/β1-mediated nuclear transport pathways to avoid the

344

interferon immune responses. Understanding the effects of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on the nucleocytoplasmic

345

trafficking system might provide a novel approach for COVID-19 therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

347

Animal care, and the production of monoclonal antibody

348

All animal experiments using the SARS-CoV-2 virus were performed in biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) facilities at

349

the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. The animal experiments, and the study protocol

350

were approved by the Institutional Committee of Laboratory Animal Experimentation of the Research Institute

351

for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University (R02-08-0). Throughout the study, we focused on minimizing animal

352

suffering and to reducing the number of animals used in the experiments. Four weeks-old male Syrian hamsters

353

were purchased from SLC (Shizuoka, Japan).

354

Experimental procedures in production of monoclonal antibody were approved by the CEC Animal

355

Care and Use Committee (permission number: CMJ-044) and performed according to CEC Animal

356

Experimentation Regulations. A rat monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6

357

protein was generated using the rat medial iliac lymph node method 45. An 8-week-old female WKY rat was

358

injected into the rear footpads with 100 L of emulsions containing ORF6 peptide (CEEQPMEID)-conjugated

359

KLH and Freund’s complete adjuvant. Seventeen days after the first immunization, an additional immunization

360

of SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 peptide-KLH was administered without an adjuvant into the tail base of the rat. Four

361

days after the second immunization, cells from the iliac lymph nodes of the immunized rat were fused with

362

mouse myeloma Sp2/0-Ag14 cells at a ratio of 5:1 in 50% polyethylene glycol. The resulting hybridoma cells

363

were plated onto 96-well plates and cultured in HAT selection medium (Hybridoma-SFM [Life Technologies,

364

Grand Island, CA, USA]; 10% FBS; 1 ng/mL mouse IL-6; 100 M hypoxanthine [Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,

365

MO, USA]; 0.4 μM aminopterin [Sigma-Aldrich]; and 16 μM thymidine [WAKO, Osaka, Japan]). The SARS-

366

CoV-2 ORF6-specific antibody was screened using ELISA, western blotting, and immunostaining of hybridoma

367

supernatants. Finally, hybridoma clone producing the monoclonal antibody later named 8B10, was selected.

368

Using a rat isotyping kit the MAb 8B10 was found to be an IgG 1 (k) antibody subtype. The monoclonal antibody

369

against SARS-CoV-2 NP (3A9 clone) was generated by Cell Engineering Corporation (Osaka, Japan).

For detection of N2 in SARS-CoV-2, total RNA of Huh7-ACE2 or lung homogenates were isolated

466

using ISOGENE II (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the Power SYBR

467

Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using an AriaMx Real-Time PCR

468

system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The relative quantification of the target mRNA levels was performed

469

using the 2-ΔΔCT method. β-actin was used as the housekeeping gene. The primers used are described in Table

470

S2.

Quantitative RT-PCR of viral RNA in the supernatant

473

The amount of RNA copies in the culture medium was determined using a qRT-PCR assay as previously

474

described with slight modifications 51. Briefly, 5 μL of culture supernatants were mixed with 5 μL of 2× RNA

475

lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 40% glycerol, 0.4 U/μL of Superase•IN

476

[Thermo Fisher Scientific]) and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Next, 90 μL of RNase free water were added to

477

the mix. A volume of 2.5 μL of the diluted sample was added to 17.5 μL of reaction mix. Real-time RT-PCR

478

was performed using the Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems) and an AriaMx

479

Real-Time PCR system (Agilent).

Plaque formation assay

482

Vero-TMPRSS2 were seeded into 24-well plates (80,000 cells/well) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for overnight. The

483

supernatants were serially diluted using inoculated medium and incubated for 2 h. Next, the culture medium

484

was removed, fresh medium containing 1% methylcellulose (1.5 mL) was added, and the cells were cultured

485

for 3 more days. Lastly, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)

486

and the plaques were visualized by using a Giemsa's azur-eosin-methylene blue solution (#109204, Merck

Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection

490

Syrian hamsters were anaesthetized with isoflurane and challenged with 1.0 x 106 PFU (in 60 μL) SARS-CoV-

491

2 via intranasal routes. The body weight was monitored daily for 5 days. Five days post infection, all animals

492

were euthanized, and the lungs were collected for histopathological examinations and qRT-PCR.

493
494

Immunohistochemistry

495

Lung tissues were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. For

496

immunohistochemical staining, 2 μm thick sections were immersed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and heated for 20

497

min with a pressure cooker. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by immersion in 3% H2O2 in PBS. After

498

treatment with 5% skim milk in PBS for 30 min at 25 oC, the sections were incubated with mouse anti-NP

499

antibody (1:500, clone 3A9). EnVision+ system-HRP-labeled polymer anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako,

500

Carpinteria, CA, USA) was used. Lastly, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and the positive

501

signals were visualized using the peroxidase–diaminobenzidine reaction.

503

KPNA2 knockout

504

For the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting KPNA2, the targeting sequences were designed using three

505

different sequences for each gene as previously described 52. The targeting sequences were synthesized using

506

DNA oligos (Eurofins Genomics, Tokyo, Japan), and cloned into the lentiCRISPR v2 (Addgene, #52961)

507

digested by BmsBI (New England Biolab, MA, USA). The target sequences for KPNA2 were described in Table

508

S3. Lentiviruses expressing three types of target sequences per gene were mixed, introduced into the Huh7 cells

509

expressing the ACE2 receptor (Huh7-ACE2), and maintained in a culture medium supplemented with 1 µg/mL

510

puromycin for 3 weeks. For viral infection, sgControl (sgCtl) or sgKPNA2 Huh7-ACE2 cells were seeded into

511

24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The different SARS-CoV-2 strains were used to infect the cells

Construction of SARS-CoV-2 replicon DNA.

516

SARS-CoV-2 replicon vector, pBAC-SCoV2-Rep, was generated using the CPER reaction as previously

517

described

518

(excluding the region spanning from S gene to ORF8 gene) were amplified using PCR, and subcloned into a

519

pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). The DNA fragments containing cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, a 25

520

nucleotide synthetic poly(A), a hepatitis delta ribozyme as well as a bovine growth hormone (BGH) termination,

521

and a polyadenylation sequences (the lightly shaded region in Fig. 3D) were amplified using a conventional

522

overlap extension PCR, and subcloned into the NotI sites of pSMART BAC vector (Lucigen, Middelton, WI,

523

USA). The luciferase reporter vector pGL4 was used as the template for PCR amplification of Renilla luciferase

524

gene. For CPER reaction, nine DNA fragments that contain approximately 40-bp overlapping ends for two

525

neighboring fragments were amplified by PCR using the aforementioned plasmids. Next, the PCR fragments

526

were mixed equimolarly (0.1 pmoL each) and subjected to CPER reaction using the PrimeSTAR GXL DNA

527

polymerase (Takara Bio.). The CPER product was extracted using phenol-chloroform, followed by ethanol

528

precipitation, resolved in TE buffer, and transformed into the BAC-Optimized Replicator v2.0 Electrocompetent

529

Cells (Lucigen). The replicon vector was maxipreped using a NucleoBond Xtra BAC kit (Takara Bio.).

ribozyme and BGH termination and, polyadenylation sequences (#14) were synthesized by Integrated DNA

537

Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA), and subcloned into a pBlueScript KS(+) vector. To generate a reporter

538

SARS-CoV-2 virus, we inserted a NanoLuc (NLuc) gene and 2A peptide into the ORF6 sequence of fragment

539

#12 (SARS-CoV-2/NLuc2AORF6). To generate an ORF6 deficient SARS-CoV-2 virus, ORF6 gene was

540

replaced with an NLuc gene (SARS-CoV-2/ΔORF6). For CPER reaction, 14 DNA fragments that contain

541

approximately 40- to 60-bp overlapping ends for two neighboring fragments were amplified using PCR from

542

the subcloned plasmids. Next, the PCR fragments were mixed equimolarly (0.1 pmoL each) and subjected to

543

CPER reaction using the PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio.). The cycling condition used

544

included an initial 2 min of denaturation at 98 °C; 35 cycles of 10 s at 98 °C, 15 s at 55 °C, and 15 min at 68 °C;

545

and a final elongation period of 15 min at 68 °C. The half of CPER product was transfected into IFNAR1-

546

deficient HEK293 cells TransIT-LT1 transfection reagents (Mirus), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

547

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors were induced in HEK293-3P6C33 cells using tetracycline. At 24 h post-

548

transfection, the culture medium were replaced with DMEM containing 2% FBS and doxycycline hydrochloride

549

(1 μg/ml). At 7-10 days post transfection, the culture medium containing progeny viruses (P0 virus) were

550

passaged and amplified in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.

Semi-intact nuclear transport assay

563

A digitonin-permeabilized in vitro nuclear transport assay was performed as previously described 47. The NLS

564

substrate GST-NLS-GFP was used 4 pmoL in 10 L of reaction mixture, and the competitive substrate AcGFP-

565

ORF6 was added to the assay with 20 pmoL, 40 pmoL, and 80 pmoL which represented 5×, 10×, or 20× the

566

NLS-substrate dosage, respectively.

The analyses of GTEx datasets

569

We obtained publicly available data regarding the expression levels of KPNA genes, sex, age category (20-29,

570

30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79), and genotype principal components (PCs) of 49 tissues from 838 post-

571

mortem donors from GTEx v8 website (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/). These samples were used for

572

expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis, and the expression levels were already normalized (see

573

“3.4.2 Gene expression quantification” in the supplementary materials 55). From the genotype PC1 and PC2, we

574

inferred the ancestry of the individuals (European (EUR), African (AFR), Asian, and others) by comparing with

575

plots showing those PCs and reported the different races in the GTEx v8 paper 56 (Fig. S4). We performed the

576

Jonckheere-Terpstra test (the number of permutation iterations was 104) to analyze the trends between age

577

category and KPNA2 expression levels using R package clinfun v1.0.15, and the Welch t-test for quantifying

578

the differences in expression levels between males and females.

Figure 7. Expression levels of KPNA2 gene for different age categories.
GTEx donors whose estimated ancestry was EUR (n = 436 for lung tissues in A and B, and n = 558 for whole
blood in C and D) were used. P-values for the trends between KPNA2 expression levels and age categories were
obtained using the two-sided Jonckheere-Terpstra test. The box represented the first and third quartiles and the
center line represented the median. The upper whisker extended from the hinge to the highest value that is within
the 1.5 × IQR of the hinge, the lower whisker extended from the hinge to the lowest value within the 1.5 × IQR
of the hinge, and the data beyond the end of the whiskers were plotted as points. F, female; M, male; IQR,
interquartile range.
