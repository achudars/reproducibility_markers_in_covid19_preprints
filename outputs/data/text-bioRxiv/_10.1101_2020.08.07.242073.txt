ABSTRACT

18

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality.

19

While much has been learned in the first months of the pandemic, many features of

20

COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common

21

presentation and many patients with this finding show no or only minor respiratory signs.

22

Studies in animals experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19,

23

provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease not easily investigated in human

24

patients. COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic to lethal. Most experimental

25

infections provide insights into mild disease. Here, using K18-hACE2 mice that we

26

originally developed for SARS studies, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes

27

severe disease in the lung, and in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and

28

vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Further, we show that infusion of

29

convalescent plasma (CP) from a recovered COVID-19 patient provided protection

30

against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early times after infection. Notably,

31

while treatment with CP prevented significant clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia.

32

Thus K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological

33

underpinnings of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic

34

interventions.

INTRODUCTION

39

The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with more than 18 million cases and more than

40

650,000 deaths worldwide since its emergence in December of 2019. SARS-CoV-2 uses

41

the same receptor as SARS-CoV, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, (hACE2)1.

42

Many of the animals infectable by SARS-CoV can also be experimentally infected with

43

SARS-CoV-2, but these animals generally develop mild disease2-6. Conversely, mice,

44

which are SARS-CoV-susceptible, are resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2 because

45

of incompatibilities between mouse ACE2 and the viral spike protein7. Several

46

approaches have been or will be used to sensitize mice to infection, including providing

47

hACE2 by adenovirus transduction8,9, mutating SARS-CoV-2 spike protein so that it binds

48

to mACE210, and modifying mACE2 so that cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-211.

49

During the 2003-2004 SARS epidemic, since mice developed only mild disease, we and

50

others engineered mice that transgenically displayed hACE212-14. K18-hACE2 mice

51

express hACE2 driven by cytokeratin 18 promoter, predominantly in epithelial cells15.

52

SARS-CoV infected-K18-hACE2 mice developed an overwhelming encephalitis, with

53

lung disease characterized by aspiration pneumonia and evidence of mild virus-induced

54

pneumonia12. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use hACE2 but show differences in

55

disease manifestations in patients. SARS-CoV-2 infects the upper airways to a much

56

greater extent than SARS-CoV and has been associated with clinical manifestations such

57

as anosmia, ageusia, thrombosis and endothelial damage in the lung vasculature, cardiac

58

and neurological disease, and a multisystem inflammatory disease in children and

59

adolescents16-18. Based on these observations, we reasoned that SARS-CoV-2 infection

60

of the K18-hACE2 mice might also show differences in pathogenesis. Here we

demonstrate the utility of K18-hACE2 mice for studies of COVID-19 disease and

62

treatments.

64

RESULTS

65

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice develop significant disease following SARS-CoV-2

66

infection.

67

To assess the susceptibility of K18-hACE2 mice to SARS-CoV-2, we performed an

68

intranasal challenge using inocula of 103, 104, and 105 PFU. As shown in Fig. 1a, we

69

observed a dose-dependent increase in weight loss and mortality. At the 105 PFU

70

inoculum, all animals succumbed, while there was variable mortality when mice were

71

inoculated with 104 PFU. To better understand the cause(s) of this morbidity and mortality,

72

we assessed the tissue distribution of viral genomic RNA by qRT PCR at 2, 4, and 6 days

73

post infection (dpi) in animals receiving the 105 PFU inoculum. The predominant target

74

organs were the lung at early timepoints, and variably, the brain at later timepoints (Fig.

75

1b, left panel). We also detected viral RNA in heart, liver, spleen, kidney, intestine, and

76

colon. To determine which tissues were sites of virus replication, we performed plaque

77

assays (Fig. 1b, right panel). The virus replicated to high titers in lung tissue at 2 dpi and

78

decreased at 4 and 6 dpi. In some, but not all animals, the brain tissue titers gradually

79

increased from 2 to 6 dpi. There was limited replication in the kidney, small intestine, and

80

colon, perhaps signifying low level hematogenous dissemination. We note that the K18

81

promoter predominantly directs gene expression to multiple epithelia-lined tissues15.

82

While K18 is an epithelial cell protein, K18-based expression of a LacZ reporter was also

83

reported in cortical and brainstem neurons19. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-

84

2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice causes dose-dependent illness associated with significant

85

involvement of lungs with a subset of animals developing brain infection at higher inocula

86

(105 PFU).

87
88

The SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary infection is extensive and progressive.

89

In view of the early pulmonary virus replication, we stained lungs at 4 and 6 dpi for SARS-

90

CoV-2 antigen. Using an inoculum of 105 PFU, we observed extensive and diffuse

91

parenchymal localization of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at 4 dpi that was less

92

intense by 6 dpi (Fig. 1c). Uninfected tissues showed no N protein signal. Examination of

93

hematoxylin and eosin stained tissues revealed extensive evidence of diffuse alveolar

94

damage with progressive alveolar/interstitial lesions characterized by edema,

95

inflammation, and focal cytomegaly in some alveolar lining cells (Fig. 1d). Also observed

96

was an accumulation of immune effector cells, including granulocytes and macrophages,

97

evidence of cell death, hemorrhage, hyaline membranes, occasional vascular thrombi,

98

and rare syncytia. Pulmonary vascular thrombi are often observed in severe human

99

COVID-1916. Between 4 and 6 dpi there was further progression of the findings of diffuse

100

alveolar damage. Alveolar septal thickening resulted from increased cellularity composed

101

of infiltrating inflammatory cells, dying cells with pyknotic to karyorrhectic nuclei, and a

102

proliferative alveolar epithelium with mitotic figures (Fig. 1d). These findings are further

103

summarized by histopathologic scoring at 4 and 6 dpi (Fig. 1e).

104
105

We also surveyed liver, heart, spleen, kidney, small intestine, and colon tissues for

106

disease associated changes (Extended Data Fig. 2). In the liver, we observed blood

5

107

vessels filled with aggregates composed of erythrocytes and platelets. At 4 dpi,

108

occasional vessels had evidence of fibrin thrombi adherent along the vascular wall

109

(Extended Data Fig. 2a), suggestive of the coagulopathy observed in COVID-19

110

autopsies 20. The other tissues examined showed no disease-specific changes. To further

111

characterize the lung tissue responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we surveyed the

112

expression of several cytokines, chemokines, and innate immune transcripts at 2, 4, and

113

6 dpi by qRT PCR. As shown in Fig. 2a, there were significant increases in type I, II, and

114

III interferons, ISG-15, RIG-I, MDA5, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, CCL-2, CCL-5, CCR7, CXCL-

115

2, CXCL-9, CXCL-10, and TNF compared to uninfected lungs over the course of infection.

116
117

Lung disease is characterized by an influx of immune effector cells

118

To further investigate the factors contributing to lung injury and virus clearance, we

119

performed immunophenotyping of infiltrating cells at 4 and 6 dpi. As shown in Fig. 2b-d,

120

we observed a progressive increase in the numbers of macrophages and monocytes,

121

neutrophils, and CD4 and CD8 T cells. Infiltrating inflammatory macrophage/monocytes

122

and neutrophils may have both protective and pathogenic roles, based on previous

123

studies of SARS and MERS21. Virus-specific T cells, which are required for optimal SARS-

124

CoV-2 clearance, were detected in lungs at 6 dpi. Virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells

125

responded to peptide pools representing SARS-CoV-2 S, N, and M proteins to varying

126

extents, as assessed by expression of IFN-g and TNF respectively (Fig. 2b, c). Together

127

these results indicate that lung disease in K18-hACE2 mice shares features with severe

128

COVID-19. Another feature of severe human COVID-19 is an early antibody response,

6

129

consistent with plasmablast activation22. We detected serum neutralizing antibodies as

130

early as 6 dpi, consistent with such a response (Fig. 2e).

131
132

SARS-CoV-2 causes brain infection in some K18-hACE2 mice.

133

As shown in Fig. 1b, infectious virus was detected in the brains of most mice following

134

105 PFU intranasal inoculation. To investigate this in more detail, we immunostained

135

tissues for the viral N protein at 4 and 6 dpi. As shown in Fig. 3a, we observed no antigen

136

staining at 4 dpi (4/4 brains studied) but at 6 dpi saw extensive staining in several brain

137

regions including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, caudate/putamen, thalamus,

138

hypothalamus, and ventral striatum (2/3 brains studied) (Extended Data Table 1).

139

Uninfected animals showed no N protein staining (3/3 animals studied). Many of these

140

areas are secondary or tertiary connections of the olfactory bulb, consistent with virus

141

entry at this site. H&E staining demonstrated cell death and thrombi in the thalamus (Fig.

142

3b, c) and neutrophilic and monocytic infiltrates in the meninges as well as cells

143

undergoing degeneration (Fig. 3d). The thalamus is affected in many COVID-19 patients

144

with neurological disease23. Of note, while most of the affected areas were connected to

145

the olfactory bulb, some, such as the area postrema and hypoglossal nucleus, are not

146

directly connected. Similar results were observed in analyses of SARS-CoV-infected

147

mice24. These results revealed an important role for olfactory bulb infection in spread to

148

the brain in some mice but also indicated that virus may enter the central nervous system

149

by other routes. Infection of the olfactory epithelium is expected to precede brain infection

150

and could also contribute to the anosmia and ageusia observed in many patients,

151

including some who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.

152

SARS-CoV-2 productively infects the sinonasal epithelium including sustentacular

153

cells. To assess virus replication in the upper respiratory tract following intranasal

154

inoculation, we quantified viral RNA in nasal secretions by qRT PCR at 3 dpi. We

155

observed that secretions from 5 of 7 mice showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 genomic

156

RNA (Ct =21.5 +/-1.2 (mean +/- SEM)), and of these 5, 4 had evidence of subgenomic

157

RNA (36.7 +/-1.1 (mean +/- SEM), consistent with active virus replication. Viral antigen

158

was readily detected in both the respiratory and olfactory epithelium at 2 and 5 dpi. At 2

159

dpi virus antigen was present at multiple sites, often at the interface of the olfactory and

160

respiratory epithelium (Fig. 3e). Viral antigen was also detected in nerve bundles

161

subjacent to the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 3f) and occasionally in vascular endothelia (Fig.

162

3g, left arrow) and Bowman’s glands (Fig. 3g, right arrow). At sites of antigen positivity in

163

the olfactory epithelium and maxillary sinus, we observed cell death and cellular debris at

164

day 2 (Fig. 3h-j), which progressed to cell sloughing and loss of cellularity by 5 dpi. (Fig.

165

3k, l). ACE2 has been detected in sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium25, but not

166

in olfactory sensory neurons, suggesting that these cells are a primary site of infection.

167

Consistent with this, we detected SARS-CoV-2 antigen in sustentacular cells (Fig. 3m-o).

168

Infection of sustentacular cells is not expected to result in spread to the olfactory bulb and

169

its connections, but could still contribute to anosmia.

170
171

SARS-CoV-2 infected K-18-hACE2 mice exhibit anosmia. To directly assess anosmia,

172

we performed two sets of behavioral tests, both of which require a normal sense of smell,

173

as described in Experimental Procedures. First, male mice were exposed to bedding

174

containing female or male dander in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube (Fig. 4a). Mice identify the

8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.242073; this version posted August 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

175

tube visually, and then preferentially spend time with the female dander, if olfaction is

176

normal. In a second experiment, we used a buried food test, in which mice are attracted

177

to a food item hidden in the bedding that they were previously conditioned to detect (Fig.

178

4c). K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 did worse than controls in both tests so

179

that at days 2 and 3 p.i., they spent less time in the vicinity of the female dander (Fig. 4b)

180

and took longer to find buried food (Fig. 4d, e). At 2 and 3 dpi, brains were not infected

181

(Fig. 1b). Additionally, mobility was largely normal since there were no differences in the

182

amount of time spent in exploring the tube containing male dander, when infected or

183

uninfected mice were compared (Fig. 4b). This suggests that anosmia at these times

184

points is primarily caused by infection of the nasal epithelium and is not a consequence

185

of spread to the brain.

186
187

Human COVID-19 convalescent plasma protects mice from severe clinical disease

188

but not from anosmia. Convalescent plasma (CP) from COVID-19 survivors is being

189

tested as a treatment in patients with clinical COVID-1926. Controlled studies are

190

underway but results of these studies have not yet been released. Studies have

191

demonstrated positive effects of CP on outcomes in several infectious diseases, if titers

192

are sufficiently high and if CP is administered early in the disease course27. To assess

193

the effect of CP on outcomes in K18-hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, we

194

administered undiluted and diluted human high titer plasma (neutralizing titer 1:1,480) 12

195

hours before infection. Undiluted plasma administered 12 hours before infection protected

196

mice from death but not mild weight loss and reduced lung tissue titers while CP diluted

197

1:3 provided partial protection (Fig. 5a, c). Convalescent plasma pretreatment markedly

198

inhibited spread of infection to the brain (Fig. 5c). On examination of lung tissues, levels

199

of viral antigen and pathological changes were greatly decreased by CP treatment (Fig.

200

5d, e). Treatment did not seem to affect primary infection of lung cells but rather prevented

201

secondary spread within the lung. As shown in Fig. 5b, delivery of undiluted plasma at 24

202

hrs post infection (p.i.) demonstrated a partial protective effect. Finally, to assess the

203

effects of CP treatment on SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia, we treated infected mice with

204

CP at 1 dpi and assessed mice for olfactory loss as described above (Fig. 4). Even though

205

mice had minimal signs of clinical disease after CP treatment, by day 4 all mice exhibited

206

profound anosmia (Fig. 4b, d, e).

207
208

DISCUSSION

209

When infected with SARS-CoV-2, K18-hACE2 mice developed a dose-dependent lung

210

disease phenotype with features similar to severe human COVID-19. This includes diffuse

211

alveolar damage, an influx of immune effector cells, tissue injury, lung vascular damage,

212

and death. Remarkably, the mice also support SARS-CoV-2 replication in the sinonasal

213

epithelium and associated with this pathology develop anosmia, a common feature of

214

human disease. Furthermore, the uniformly fatal disease outcome with a 105 inoculum

215

was prevented by pre-treatment with CP from a COVID-19 patient. Notably, CP pre-

216

treatment enhanced the kinetics of virus clearance but did not prevent initial infection of

217

the lungs, damage to nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelia, or anosmia. SARS-CoV-2

218

infection of K18-hACE2 mice treated with CP or, potentially, neutralizing monoclonal

219

antibodies will be especially useful for studies of anosmia because mice do not succumb

220

to the infection, but like many infected patients with mild disease, have olfactory loss as

10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.242073; this version posted August 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

221

a major manifestation18. Anosmia may result from damage to supporting sustentacular

222

cells and not to olfactory sensory neurons, suggesting that the resulting inflammatory

223

milieu, rather than direct neuronal damage is disease-causing. Therefore, we postulate

224

that the observed anosmia has at least two possible explanations. First, the infection of

225

sustentacular cells may disrupt signaling from olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) to the

226

olfactory bulb. For example, sustentacular cells provide support to OSN by maintaining

227

ion balance28, which may be altered either directly by sustentacular cell infection or

228

indirectly via disorganization of the olfactory epithelium (OE), leading to loss of cilia from

229

OSN and deficient signal transduction29. The second possibility is collateral damage to

230

OSN resulting from pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by SARS-CoV-2 infected

231

sustentacular cells. These cells have been reported to secrete cytokines such as TNF-a,

232

Il-1b, Il-1a, and CXCL2 in chronic rhinosinusitis and COVID-19 patients30,31. These are

233

not mutually exclusive explanations.

234
235

Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 to gain entry into cells and both

236

cause lung and brain disease, the disease manifestations are different. Most importantly,

237

SARS-CoV caused a brain infection when as little as 3.2 PFU were administered

238

intranasally24, while even 104 PFU SARS-CoV-2 only variably infected the brain. A

239

consequence of this difference in CNS susceptibility is that lung damage was obvious

240

after SARS-CoV-2 infection, while it was obscured by the aspiration pneumonia that

241

developed in SARS mice as a consequence of probable infection of the cardio-respiratory

242

center in the medulla.

244

All K18-hACE2 mice succumbed to 105 SARS-CoV-2, from lung and, in some cases,

245

brain disease. This uniform lethality makes these mice useful for evaluation of anti-viral

246

therapies and vaccines, and also sets a high standard for their efficacy. This is illustrated

247

in Fig. 5, where mice treated with convalescent plasma were protected from lethal

248

disease, but not infection. This absence of complete protection could reflect use of human

249

convalescent plasma in mice, since some antibody effector functions are species-specific.

250

Of note, while most mice receiving 1:3 or 1:9 dilutions of convalescent plasma had no

251

evidence of brain infection (Fig. 5c), they succumbed to progressive lung disease.

252

Infection with a range of virus inocula will be useful for evaluation of therapeutic

253

interventions in a variety of pathological settings, as well as assessment of upper airway

254

disease and anosmia. Therefore, K18-hACE2 mice, readily available from Jackson

255

Laboratories, provide a useful model to study the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-mediated

256

disease and to evaluate interventions.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

369

Human subjects approval.

370

Written informed consent was obtained from subjects to obtain plasma for participation in

371

this study. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of

372

Iowa (IRB (#202003554 and #201402735).

373
374

Mice, cells, and virus.

375

Transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 were previously reported

376

expressed under control of the cytokeratin 18 promoter. The mice used in these studies

377

were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (034860-B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlman/J)

378

and are congenic on the C57BL/6 background. Non-transgenic C57BL/6 mice were used

379

as controls in some experiments.

380

All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the

381

University of Iowa. The 2019n-CoV/USA-WA1/2019 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Accession

382

number: MT985325.1) used in these studies was passaged on Calu-3 2B4 cells. Calu-3

383

2B4 cells were grown in MEM (GIBCO, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 20% FBS.

384

Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, GIBCO, Grand

385

Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

390

health were monitored daily. All experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a

391

Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) Laboratory at the University of Iowa.

392
393

Nasal lavage. Mice were sedated with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg ketamine/12.5

394

mg/kg xylazine). 100 µl of Carbachol (100 µg/ml) was administered I.P. and after

395

approximately 15 minutes, nasal secretions were recovered. 20 µl secretions were

396

recovered per mouse. Nasal secretions were immediately added to 500 µl Trizol, mixed

397

and stored at -80°C until RNA was isolated.

398
399

Virus titer by plaque assay.

400

Virus or tissue homogenate supernatants were serially diluted in DMEM. 12 well plates

401

of VeroE6 cells were inoculated at 37oC in 5% CO2 for 1 h and gently rocked every 15

402

min. After removing the inocula, plates were overlaid with 1.2% agarose containing 4%

403

FBS. After 3 days, overlays were removed, and plaques visualized by staining with 0.1%

404

crystal violet. Viral titers were quantified as PFU/mL tissue.

417

mouse anti-C9 antibody (clone Rho 1D4, Cat. No.: MAB5356, EMD Millipore). For

418

intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), lymphocytes were cultured in 96-well dishes at 37°C

419

for 5-6 h in the presence of 2 μM peptide pool and brefeldin A (BD Biosciences). Cells

420

were then labeled for cell-surface markers, fixed/permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm

421

Solution (BD Biosciences), and labeled with anti-IFN-g and anti-TNF antibody. All flow

422

cytometry data were acquired using a BD FACSVerse and analyzed with FlowJo

423

software.

425

Histology and Immunohistochemistry.

426

Animals were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by zinc

427

formalin. Lungs were fixed in zinc formalin. For routine histology, tissue sections (~4 µm

428

each) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The following criteria were used for

429

scoring edema, hyaline membrane formation and necrotic cellular debris: 0- none; 1-

430

uncommon detection in <5% lung fields (200x); 2- detectable in up to 33% of lung fields;

431

3- detectable in up to 33-66% of lung fields; 4- detectable in >66% of lung fields. For

432

scoring neutrophil infiltration: 0- within normal limits; 1-scattered PMNs sequestered in

433

septa; 2- #1 plus solitary PMNs extravasated in airspaces; 3-#2 plus small aggregates in

434

vessel and airspaces. For scoring mononuclear infiltrates, thrombosis and hemorrhage:

435

0-none; 1 - uncommon detection in <5% lung fields (200x); 2- detectable in up to 33% of

436

lung fields; 3- detectable in up to 33-66% of lung fields; 4- detectable in >66% of lung

437

fields.

438

For SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, slides were incubated with blocking reagent (10%

439

normal goat serum x 30 minutes) followed by rabbit monoclonal antibody against SARS-

440

CoV2 N protein (1:20,000 dilution x 60 minutes, #40143-R019, Sino Biological US Inc.,

441

Wayne, PA, USA), then incubated with Rabbit Envision (Dako) and diaminobenzidine

442

(Dako) as chromogen. Tissues were examined and scored in a post-examination method

443

of masking by a boarded experimental pathologist 32. Ordinal scores for lesion parameters

444

were assigned using the following tiers: 0 = within expected limits; 1 - uncommon, <5%;

445

2 - detectable in 5-33%; 3 - detectable in 34-66% and 4 - detectable in >66% of lung fields

446

(200x objective magnification).

447
448

Human convalescent plasma.

449

High titer convalescent plasma was collected with subject consent under an IRB

450

(#202003554) approved protocol that allows use of samples for research.

451

convalescent plasma donor was a 58 year old female who had molecularly confirmed

452

COVID-19 more than 4 weeks prior to their donation. Following the donation, she tested

453

positive for HLA antibodies so the plasma was not eligible for administration to patients

454

and was diverted to research. Antibody testing (EUROIMMUN SARS-COV-2 ELISA

455

(IgG)) performed on this donor was 9.8, well above the cutoff of 1.1 for a positive result.

456

Neutralization titer using a luciferase-expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus

457

assay showed that the neutralization IC50 titer was 1:1,480. Control plasma was obtained

458

from an expired plasma unit collected prior to COVID-19 spread in our area and this

462

RNA isolation and qRT PCR.

463

Total RNA was extracted from tissues (or nasal lavage) using Trizol (Invitrogen)

464

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following a DNase treatment step 200 ng of

465

total RNA was used as a template for first strand cDNA. The resulting cDNA was

466

subjected to amplification of selected genes by real-time quantitative PCR using Power

467

SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Average values from duplicates of

468

each gene were used to calculate the relative abundance of transcripts normalized to

469

HPRT and presented as 2-ΔCT. The primers used for cytokine and chemokines were

470

previously reported33. For detection of viral genomes, the following primers were used to

471

amplify the genomic RNA for the N protein: 2019-nCoV_N1-F: 5’-GAC CCC AAA ATC

472

AGC GAA AT-3’; 2019-nCoV_N1-R: 5’-TCT GGT TAC TGC CAG TTG AAT CTG-3’.

473

The following primers were used to amplify the subgenomic RNA for the E protein: F: 5’-

474

CGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTC-3’; R: 5’-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3’.

475
476

Pseudovirus neutralizing antibody assay: To determine neutralization activity of

477

patient and mouse plasma, we used a luciferase reporter-based pseudovirus

478

neutralization assay, which has a nonreplicative vesicular stomatitis virus backbone

479

coated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-

480

hACE2 mice were collected at the indicated time points and heat inactivated by

481

incubation at 56°C for 30 min. Human convalescent plasma or mouse sera were serially

482

diluted twofold in 96-well plates and incubated with the same volume of VSV

483

pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at 37°C for 1 h. Samples were placed onto

484

Vero E6 cells and incubated at 37°C for 1 h to allow virus binding. After removal of the

485

initial inoculum, cells were incubated for 24 hours. Neutralization was measured with a

486

luciferase assay kit (Promega) and plotted relative to the value for control wells.

487
488

Behavioral studies.

489

Social Scent Discrimination Test. Social-scent discrimination task was designed to

490

assess the capability of mice to discriminate social scents as described previously 34. Two

491

identical tubes were separately sealed in a Ziploc bag in a large cage (used for housing

492

rats (31 cm x 26 cm x 22 cm)) containing bedding from female mice and from the

493

experimental cage overnight. Next, mice were released in a fresh cage containing the

494

tubes placed at two different corners. Sniffing latency (sniffing and exploring the tubes)

495

was calculated within a 5 min period. One trial on each mouse was performed each day

496

with the position of tubes changed daily. Data were recorded in the BSL3 facility from a

497

distance of approximately 1 meter.

498

Buried Food Test: Evaluation of odor detection was carried out by a buried food test (bft)

499

as described previously34. Briefly, food was confirmed prior to initiation of the

500

experiments. Mice were sensitized to the food for 10-15 minutes on the day of the

501

experiment. The food pellet was then buried approximately 1 cm below the surface of

502

bedding in a fresh cage. One trial per mouse per day was performed with a changed

503

position of food on a daily basis. The latency to locate and uncover the buried food pellet

504

was recorded with a stopwatch. Mice were allowed to explore the cage for 4 min and if

505

they could not locate the food, the time was recorded as 4 min. The experiment was

506

repeated daily.

507

Statistical analysis.

508

ANOVA and Student’s t tests were used to analyze differences in mean values between

509

groups using GraphPad Prism 7. All results are expressed as mean ± standard error

510

(SEM) and were corrected for multiple comparisons. For behavioral studies, data from

511

the social scent discrimination test, and buried food test were analyzed by two-way

512

ANOVA and one-way ANOVA tests, respectively. P values of <0.05 were considered

513

statistically significant. (*, P values of ≤0.05. **, P values of ≤0.005. ***, P values of
