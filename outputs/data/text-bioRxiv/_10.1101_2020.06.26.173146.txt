Introduction

38The

spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affected over 100

39countries

in a matter of weeks, therefore on January 30th the World Health Organization (WHO)

40announced

the COVID-19 epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [1].

41Italy

has been one of the most affected countries with more than 230000 infected people and more

42that

33000 deaths and became the first country in Europe to proceed with a total lockdown (so

43called
44the

phase 1, started on 9 March 2020). The government decided to impose strong restrictions in

whole Country closing schools, public places (such as, restaurants or cafés) and shops,

45allowing

only the basic necessities stores (such as supermarkets and pharmacies) and relative

46activities

to remain open [2]. The huge increase number of infected people resulted, on 13 March,

of passengers inside the buses, 2) interpersonal distance of one meter, 3) rear door

the national guidelines from the DPCM [9], established the exact operational rules for

of the air and surfaces in indoor environments are crucial to better understand the SARS-

spreading and airborne transmission, to better assess the risks for doctors and health-care

79operators

[6]. However, these observations are very limited and mostly confined to hospital

80environments

[11, 12]. Results of risk models assessing the airborne transmission of the virus in

indoor environments such as restaurants, post offices, pharmacies, supermarkets and

82banks,

suggest the key role of air ventilation, but simulations of more confined environments like

83those

inside city buses, trolleybuses, trams or trains, are missing [13]. For this reason, we

84analysed
85to

both the air and samples taken from the surfaces most frequently touched of a city bus,

better understand the possible spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and in order to assess the

86effectiveness

of the measures defined for the containment of COVID-19 diffusion.

probably prevent the virus diffusion in the air inside the bus. These results are in

with different model simulations that recommend facial masks to combat the SARS-

virus spread in aerosols and droplets by asymptomatic people [19]. Moreover, the air

Conclusion

181The

end of the lockdown imposed to contain the COVID-19 infection outbreak is entailing a

182growing

number of people that restart the usual daily activities including travelling on public

183transport.
184infected
185but

Our observations inside a bus showed that the air and all the surfaces samples were not

by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even if it was not possible to test the passengers to SARS-CoV-2

considering that the asymptomatic people infected could be more than 30% [18], we can

186expect
187about

a potential infection inside the bus. Whether or not the number of infected passengers was

30%, our findings confirm that the measures established for public transport in terms of

188sanitation,

air ventilation and interpersonal precautions (facial mask, distancing, hands

are effective, at least during this study, to make healthy and COVID-free the
