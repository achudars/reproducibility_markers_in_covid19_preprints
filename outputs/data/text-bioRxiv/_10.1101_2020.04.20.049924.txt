ABSTRACT

36
37

The sudden emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

38

at the end of 2019 from the Chinese province of Hubei and its subsequent pandemic spread

39

highlight the importance of understanding the full molecular details of coronavirus infection

40

and pathogenesis. Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and

41

SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the

42

commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher

43

levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was

44

recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-

45

infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a

46

variety of nonstructural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron

47

microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are

48

very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we

49

determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus

50

replication (Remdesivir, Alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2

51

infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon

52

alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in

53

Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive

54

mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative ‘furin-like

55

cleavage site’ in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent

56

phenotypic change in plaque assays.

INTRODUCTION

59
60

For the first time in a century, societies and economies worldwide have come to a near-

61

complete standstill due to a pandemic outbreak of a single RNA virus. This virus, the severe

62

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1) belongs to the coronavirus (CoV)

63

family, which is thought to have given rise to zoonotic introductions on multiple previous

64

occasions during the past centuries. Coronaviruses are abundantly present in mammalian

65

reservoir species, including bats (2), and should now be recognized definitively as a

66

continuous zoonotic threat with the ability to cause severe human disease and explosive

67

pandemic transmission.

68

To date, seven CoVs that can infect humans have been identified, which segregate into two

69

classes. On the one hand, there are four endemic human CoVs (HCoVs), the first of which

70

were identified in the 1960’s, annually causing a substantial number of common colds (3, 4).

71

On the other hand, we now know of (at least) three zoonotic CoVs that have caused outbreaks

72

in the human population recently: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-

73

CoV) (5, 6) in 2002-2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (7, 8)

74

since 2012 (and probably earlier) and the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (9, 10). The latter

75

agent emerged near Wuhan (People’s Republic of China) in the fall of 2019 and its animal

76

source is currently under investigation (11-13). Transmission to humans of SARS-CoV and

77

MERS-CoV was attributed to civet cats (14) and dromedary camels (15), respectively,

78

although both species may have served merely as an intermediate host due to their close

79

contact with humans. All three zoonotic CoVs belong to the genus betacoronavirus (beta-

80

CoV), which is abundantly represented among the CoVs that circulate in the many bat species

81

on this planet (2, 16-19). The genetic diversity of bat CoVs and their phylogenetic relationships

82

with the four known endemic HCoVs (OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63; the latter two being

83

alpha-CoVs) suggests that also these may have their evolutionary origins in bat hosts, for

84

most of them probably centuries ago (20).The potential of multiple CoVs from different genera

85

to cross-species barriers had been predicted and documented previously (2, 16-19, 21, 22),

86

but regrettably was not taken seriously enough to invest more extensively in prophylactic and

87

therapeutic solutions that could have contributed to rapidly containing an outbreak of the

88

current magnitude.

89

Compared to other RNA viruses, CoVs possess an unusually large positive-sense RNA

90

genome with a size ranging from 26 to 34 kilobases (23). The CoV genome is single-stranded

91

and its 5’-proximal two-thirds encode for the large and partially overlapping replicase

92

polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (4,000-4,500 and 6,700-7,200 amino acids long, respectively),

93

with the latter being a C-terminally extended version of the former that results from ribosomal

94

frameshifting. The replicase polyproteins are processed into 16 cleavage products (non-

95

structural proteins, nsps) by two internal proteases, the papain-like protease (PLpro) in nsp3

96

and the 3C-like or ‘main’ protease (Mpro) in nsp5 (24). Specific trans-membrane nsps (nsp3, 4

97

and 6) than cooperate to transform intracellular membranes into a viral replication organelle

98

(RO) (25) that serves to organize and execute CoV RNA synthesis, which entails genome

99

replication and the synthesis of an extensive nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. The latter

100

are used to express the genes present in the 3’-proximal third of the genome, which encode

101

the four common CoV structural proteins (spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and

102

nucleocapsid (N) protein) and the ‘so-called’ accessory protein genes, most of which are

103

thought to be involved in the modulation of host responses to CoV infection (26). The CoV

104

proteome includes a variety of potential targets for drug repurposing or de novo development

105

of specific inhibitors of e.g. viral entry (S protein) or RNA synthesis (27). The latter process

106

depends on a set of enzymatic activities (24) including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

107

(RdRp; in nsp12), RNA helicase (in nsp13), two methyltransferases involved in mRNA capping

108

(a guanine-N7-methyltranferase in nsp14 and a nucleoside-2’-O-methyltransferase in nsp16)

109

and a unique exoribonuclease (ExoN, in nsp14) that promotes the fidelity of the replication of

110

the large CoV genome (28). Other potential drug targets are the transmembrane proteins that

111

direct the formation of the viral RO, several less well characterised enzymatic activities and a

112

set of smaller nsps (nsp7-10) that mainly appear to serve as cofactors/modulators of other

113

nsps.

114

The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly identified as a CoV that is relatively closely

115

related to the 2003 SARS-CoV (9, 29, 30).The two genome sequences are about ~80%

116

identical and the organization of open reading frames is essentially the same. The overall level

117

of amino acid sequence identity of viral proteins ranges from about 65% in the least conserved

118

parts of the S protein to about 95% in the most conserved replicative enzyme domains,

119

prompting the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of

120

Viruses to classify the new agent within the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-

121

related coronavirus, which also includes the 2003 SARS-CoV (1). The close phylogenetic

122

relationship also implies that much of our knowledge of SARS-CoV molecular biology,

123

accumulated over the past 17 years, can probably be translated to SARS-CoV-2. Many reports

124

posted over the past months have described such similarities, including the common affinity

125

of the two viruses for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (9, 31). This

126

receptor is abundantly expressed in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney cells). Since

127

2003, Vero cells have been used extensively for SARS-CoV research in cell culture-based

128

infection models by many laboratories, including our own.

129

We set out to establish the basic features of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells and

130

compare it to the Frankfurt-1 SARS-CoV isolate from 2003 (32, 33) . When requesting virus

131

isolates (February 2020), and in spite of the rapidly emerging public health crisis, we were

132

confronted - not for the first time - with administrative hurdles and discussions regarding the

133

alleged ‘ownership’ of virus isolates cultured from (anonymous) clinical samples. From a

134

biological and evolutionary point of view, this would seem a strangely anthropocentric

135

consideration, but it ultimately forced us to reach out across the globe to Australian colleagues

136

in Melbourne. After checking our credentials and completing a basic material transfer

137

agreement, they provided us (within one week) with their first SARS-CoV-2 isolate (originally

138

named

2019-nCoV/Victoria/1/2020

and

139

BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020; (34), which will be used throughout this study. Until now, this

140

isolate has been provided to 17 other laboratories worldwide to promote the rapid

141

characterization of SARS-CoV-2, in this critical time of lockdowns and other preventive

142

measures to avoid a collapse of public health systems.

143

In this report, we describe a comparative study of the basic replication features of SARS-CoV

144

and SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells, including growth kinetics, virus titres, plaque phenotype

145

and an analysis of intracellular viral RNA and protein synthesis. Additionally, we analysed

146

infected cells by light and electron microscopy, and demonstrated cross-reactivity of 13

147

available SARS-CoV-specific antisera (recognising 10 different viral proteins) with their SARS-

148

CoV-2 counterparts. Finally, we established the conditions for a medium-throughput assay to

149

evaluate basic antiviral activity and assessed the impact of some known CoV inhibitors on

150

SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to many anticipated similarities, our results also

151

established some remarkable differences between the two viruses that warrant further

152

investigation. One of them is the rapid evolution - during virus passaging in Vero cells - of a

153

specific region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that contains the so-called ‘furin-like cleavage

154

site’.

159

Cell and virus culture

160

Vero E6 cells and HuH7 cells were grown as described previously (35). SARS-CoV-2 isolate

161

Australia/VIC01/2020 (GeneBank ID: MT007544.1; (34)) was derived from a positively-testing

162

nasopharyngeal swab in Melbourne, Australia, and was propagated twice in Vero/hSLAM

163

cells, before being shared with other laboratories. In Leiden, the virus was passaged two more

164

times at low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) in Vero E6 cells to obtain a working stock (p2 stock).

with SARS-CoV-2. Infection of Vero E6 cells was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline

167

(PBS) containing 50 µg/ml DEAE-dextran and 2% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco). The

168

inoculum was added to the cells for 1 h at 37°C, after which cells were washed twice with PBS

169

and maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza) with 2% FCS, 2mM L-

170

glutamine (PAA) and antibiotics (Sigma). Viral titres were determined by plaque assay in Vero

171

E6 cells as described previously (37). For plaque picking, plaque assays were performed using

172

our p1 stock, while using an overlay containing 1% of agarose instead of Avicel (RC-581; FMC

173

Biopolymer). Following neutral red staining, small and large plaques were picked and used to

174

inoculate a 9.6-cm2 dish of Vero E6 cells containing 2 ml of EMEM-2%FCS medium, yielding

175

p1 virus. After 48 h, 200 µl of the culture supernatant was used to infect the next dish of cells

176

(p2), a step that was repeated one more time to obtain p3 virus. All work with live SARS-CoV

177

and SARS-CoV-2 was performed in biosafety laboratory level 3 facilities at Leiden University

178

Medical Center, the Netherlands.

179
180

Analysis of intracellular viral RNA and protein synthesis

181

Isolation of intracellular RNA was performed by lysing infected cell monolayers with TriPure

182

isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After

183

purification and ethanol precipitation, intracellular RNA samples were loaded onto a 1.5%

184

agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde, which was run overnight at low voltage overnight

185

in MOPS buffer (10 mM MOPS (sodium salt) (pH 7), 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA).

186

Dried agarose gels were used for direct detection of viral mRNAs by hybridization with a 32P-

187

labeled oligonucleotide probe (5’-CACATGGGGATAGCACTAC-3’) that is complementary to

188

a fully conserved sequence located 30 nucleotides upstream of the 3’ end of the genome and

189

all subgenomic mRNAs produced by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. After hybridization, RNA

190

bands were visualised and quantified by phosphorimaging using a Typhoon-9410 variable

191

mode scanner (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant TL software (GE Healthcare). In order to

192

verify the amount of RNA loaded, a second hybridization was performed using a

193

oligonucleotide probe recognizing 18S ribosomal RNA (5’-GATCCGAGGGCCTCACTAAAC7

3’). Protein lysates were obtained by lysing infected cell monolayers in 4x Laemmli sample

195

buffer and were analysed by semi-dry Western blotting onto Hybond 0.2µM polyvinylidene

196

difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE Healthcare). Membranes were incubated with rabbit

197

antisera diluted in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 containing 5% dry milk (Campina). Primary

198

antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG

199

antibody (Dako) and protein bands were visualised using Clarity Western Blot substrate

200

(Biorad) and detected using an Advanced Q9 Alliance imager (Uvitec Cambridge).

201
202

Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis

203

SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA was isolated from cell culture supernatants using TriPure isolation

204

reagent (Roche Applied Science) and purified according to manufacturer’s instructions. The

205

total amount of RNA in samples was measured using a Qubit fluorometer and RNA High

206

Sensitivity kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For next-generation sequencing (NGS) library

207

preparation, RNA (25-100 ng) was mixed with random oligonucleotide primers using the

208

NEBNext® First Strand Synthesis Module kit for Illumina® (NEB) and incubated for 10 min at

209

94°C. NGS of samples was performed by a commercial service provider (GenomeScan,

210

Leiden, the Netherlands) while including appropriate quality controls after each step of the

211

procedure. Sequencing was performed using a NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System (Illumina).

212

Subsequently, sequencing reads were screened for the presence of human (GRCh37.75),

213

mouse (GRCm38.p4), E. coli MG1655 (EMBL U00096.2), phiX (RefSeq NC_001422.1) and

214

common vector sequences (UniVec and ChlSab1.1). Prior to alignment, reads were trimmed

215

to remove adapter sequences and filtered for sequence quality. The remaining reads were

216

mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 GenBank reference sequence (NC_045512.2; (38)). Data

217

analysis was performed using Bowtie 2 (39). Raw NGS data sets for each virus sample

218

analysed in this study are deposited in NCBI Bioproject and available under the following

219

links: ---. Only SARS-CoV-2-specific reads were included in these data files.

220

To study evolution/adaptation of the S protein gene, we performed an in-depth analysis of

221

reads covering the S1/S2 region of the S protein gene. This was done for the p2 stock and for

222

the four virus samples of the plaque picking experiment shown in Fig. 1a. First, all reads

223

spanning nt 23,576 to 23,665 of the SARS-CoV genome were selected. Next, reads

224

constituting less than 1% of the total number of selected reads were excluded for further

225

analysis. The remaining number of reads were 3,860 (p2 stock), 1,924 (S5p1), 2,263 (S5p2),

226

4,049 (S5p3) and 3,323 (L8p1). These reads were translated in the S protein open reading

227

frame and the resulting amino acid sequences were aligned, grouped on the basis of

228

containing the same mutations/deletions in the S1/S2 region and ranked by frequency of

229

occurrence (Fig. 1b).

230
231

Antisera and immunofluorescence microscopy

232

The SARS-CoV-specific rabbit or mouse antisera/antibodies used in this study are listed in

233

Table 1. Most antisera were described previously (see references in Table 1), with the

234

exception of three rabbit antisera recognizing SARS-CoV nsps 8, 9 and 15. These were raised

235

using full-length (His)6-tagged bacterial expression products (nsp8 and nsp15) or a synthetic

236

peptide (nsp9, aa 4209-4230 of SARS-CoV pp1a), which were used to immunize New Zealand

237

white rabbits as described previously (40, 41). Cross-reactivity of antisera to SARS-CoV-2

238

targets was evaluated microscopically by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and for some

239

antisera (nsp3 and N protein) also by Western blot analysis. Double-stranded RNA was

240

detected using mouse monoclonal antibody J2 from Scicons (42).

241

Cells were grown on glass coverslips and infected as described above (43). At 12, 24, 48 or

242

72 h p.i., cells were fixed overnight at 4°C using 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Cells

243

were washed with PBS containing 10 mM glycine and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100

244

in PBS. Cells were incubated with antisera diluted in PBS containing 5% FCS. Secondary

245

antibodies used were an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen), a

246

Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)

and an Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained

248

with 1 µg/ml Hoechst 33258 (ThermoFischer). Samples were embedded using Prolong Gold

249

(Life Technologies) and analysed with a Leica DM6B fluorescence microscope using LASX

Electron microscopy

253

Vero E6 cells were grown on TC treated Cell Star dishes (Greiner Bio-One) and infected at an

254

m.o.i. of 3, or mock-infected. Cells were fixed after 6, 8 and 10 h p.i. for 30 min at room

255

temperature with freshly prepared 2% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH

256

7.4) and then stored overnight in the fixative at 4°C. The samples were then washed with 0.1

257

M cacodylate buffer, treated for 1 hour with 1% (wt/vol) OsO4 at 4°C, washed with 0.1 M

258

cacodylate buffer and Milli-Q water, and stained with 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate in Mili-Q water.

259

After a new washing step, samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol

260

(70%, 80%, 90%,100%), embedded in epoxy resin (LX-112, Ladd Research) and polymerized

261

at 60°C. Sections (100 nm thick) were collected on mesh-100 copper EM grids covered with

262

a carbon-coated Pioloform layer and post-stained with 7% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate and

263

Reynold’s lead citrate. The samples were examined in a Twin transmission electron

264

microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific (formerly FEI)) operated at 120 kV and images were

265

collected with a OneView 4k high-frame rate CMOS camera (Gatan).

Compounds and antiviral screening assay

268

A 10-mM stock of Remdesivir (HY-104077; MedChemexpress) was dissolved in DMSO and

269

stored in aliquots for single use at -80°C. Alisporivir was kindly provided by DebioPharm (Dr.

270

Grégoire Vuagniaux, Lausanne, Switzerland; (44)) and a 20-mM stock was dissolved in 96%

271

ethanol and stored in aliquots for single use at -20°C. A 20-mM chloroquine stock (C6628;

276

compounds were prepared in EMEM with 2% FCS and 50 µl was added to the cells 30 min

277

prior to infection. Subsequently, half of the wells were infected with 300 PFU each of SARS-

278

CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in order to evaluate inhibition of infection, while the other wells were

279

used to in parallel monitor the (potential) cytotoxicity of compounds. Each compound

concentration was tested in quadruplicate and each assay plate contained the following

controls: no cells (background control), cells only treated with medium (mock infection for

282

283

3 days p.i., 20 μL/well of CellTiter 96 Aqueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation reagent

Rapid adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 during passaging in

294

Vero E6 cells

295

SARS-CoV-2 isolate BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 was received as a stock derived from two

296

consecutive passages in Vero/hSLAM cells (34). The virus was then propagated two more

297

times at low MOI in Vero E6 cells, in which it caused a severe cytopathic effect (CPE). We

298

also attempted propagation in HuH7 cells, using the same amount of virus or a ten-fold larger

299

inoculum, but did not observe any cytopathology after 72 h (data not shown). At 24 h p.i.,

300

immunofluorescence microscopy (see below) revealed infection of only a small percentage of

301

the HuH7 cells, without any clear spread to other cells occurring in the next 48 h. We therefore

302

conclude that infection of HuH7 cells does not lead to a productive SARS-CoV-2 infection and

303

deemed this cell line unsuitable for further SARS-CoV-2 studies.

304

The infectivity titre of the Leiden-p2 stock grown in Vero E6 cells was analysed by plaque

305

assay, after which we noticed a mixed plaque phenotype (~1:3 ratio of small versus large

306

(plaques; data not shown) while a virus titre of 7 x 106 PFU/ml was calculated. To verify the

307

identity and genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2/p2 virus stock, we isolated genomic RNA

308

from culture supernatant and applied next-generation sequencing (NGS; see methods for

309

details). The resulting consensus sequence was found to be identical to the sequence

310

previously deposited in GenBank (accession number MT007544.1) (34), with one exception

311

(see below). Compared to the SARS-CoV-2 GenBank reference sequence (NC_045512.3)

312

(38) and other field isolates (29), isolate BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 exhibits >99.9%

313

sequence identity. In addition to synonymous mutations in the nsp14-coding sequence

314

(U19065 to C) and S protein gene (U22303 to G), ORF3a contains a single non-synonymous

315

mutation (G26144 to U). Strikingly, the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) contains a 10-nt deletion

316

(nt 29750-29759; CGAUCGAGUG) located 120 nt upstream of the genomic 3’ end , which is

317

not present in other SARS-CoV-2 isolates thus far (>670 SARS-CoV2 sequences present in

318

GenBank on April 17, 2020).

319

In about 71% of the 95,173 p2 NGS reads covering this position, we noticed a G23607 to A

320

mutation encoding an Arg682 to Gln substitution near the so-called S1/S2 cleavage site of the

321

viral S protein (see Discussion), with the other 29% of the reads being wild-type sequence. As

322

this ratio approximated the observed ratio between large and small plaques, we performed a

323

plaque assay on the p1 virus stock (Fig. 1a, leftmost well) and picked multiple plaques of each

324

size, which were passaged three times in Vero E6 cells while monitoring their plaque

325

phenotype. Interestingly, for several of the small-plaque virus clones (like S5; Fig. 1a) we

326

observed rapid conversion to a mixed or large-plaque phenotype during these three passages,

327

while large-plaque virus clones (like L8) stably retained their plaque phenotype (Fig. 1a). NGS

328

analysis of the genome of a large-plaque p1 virus (L8p1) revealed that >99% of the reads in

329

the S1/S2 cleavage site region contained the G23607 to A mutation described above. No other

330

mutations were detected in the genome, thus clearly linking the Arg682 to Gln substitution in

331

the S protein to the large-plaque phenotype observed for the L8p1 virus.

332

Next, we also analysed the genomes of the p1, p2 and p3 viruses derived from a small-plaque

333

(S5) that was picked. This virus clone retained its small-plaque phenotype during the first

334

passage (Fig. 1a; S5p1), but began to yield an increasing proportion of large(r) plaques during

335

subsequent passages. Sequencing of S5p2 (Fig 1b) revealed a variety of low-frequency reads

336

with mutations near the S1/S2 cleavage site motif (aa 681-687; PRRAR↓SV), with G23607 to

337

A (specifying the Arg682 to Gln substitution) again being the dominant one (in ~0.9% of the

338

reads covering nt 23,576 to 23,665 of the genome). At lower frequencies single-nucleotide

339

changes specifying Arg682 to Trp and Arg683 to Leu substitutions were also detected.

340

Furthermore, a 10-aa deletion (residues 679-688) that erases the S1/S2 cleavage site region

341

was discovered, as well as a 5-aa deletion (residues 675-679) immediately preceding that

342

region. The amount of large plaques increased substantially upon the next passage, with NGS

343

revealing the prominent emergence of the mutants containing the 10-aa deletion or the Arg682

344

to Gln point mutation (~22% and ~12% of the reads, respectively), and yet other minor variants

345

with mutations in the PRRAR↓SV sequence being discovered. Taken together these data

346

clearly link the large-plaque phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 to the acquisition of mutations in this

347

particular region of the S protein, which apparently provides a strong selective advantage

348

during passaging in Vero E6 cells.

349
350

Comparative kinetics of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells

351

To our knowledge, a detailed comparison of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV replication kinetics

352

in cell culture has not been reported so far. Therefore, we infected Vero E6 cells with the

353

SASR-CoV-2/p2 virus stock at high m.o.i. to analyse viral RNA synthesis, protein expression

354

and the release of infectious viral progeny (Fig. 2a). This experiment was performed using 4

355

replicates per time point and for comparison we included the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 isolate

356

(Drosten, Gunther et al. 2003), which has been used in our laboratory since 2003. During the

357

early stages of infection (until 8 h p.i.), the growth curves of the two viruses were similar, but

358

subsequently cells infected with SARS-CoV clearly produced more infectious progeny (about

359

50-fold more) than SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, with both viruses reaching their plateau by

360

about 14 h p.i. As shown in Fig. 2b, despite its transition to a mainly large-plaque phenotype,

361

the largest SARS-CoV-2/p3 plaques were still substantially smaller than those obtained with

362

SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1.

363

In parallel, we analysed the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis by isolating intracellular viral RNA,

364

subjecting it to agarose gel electrophoresis and visualizing the various viral mRNA species by

365

in-gel hybridization with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe recognizing a fully conserved 19-

366

nt sequence located 30 nt upstream of the 3’ end of both viral genomes (Fig. 3a). This revealed

367

the anticipated presence of the genomic RNA and eight subgenomic mRNAs, together forming

368

the well-known 5’- and 3’- coterminal nested set of transcripts required for full CoV genome

369

expression.

370

In general, for both viruses, the accumulation of viral RNAs followed the growth curves

371

depicted in Fig. 2a. The relative abundance of the individual RNAs was determined using the

372

12, 14 and 24 h p.i. samples (averages presented in Fig. 3b) and found to be largely similar,

373

with the exception of SARS-CoV-2 mRNAs 7 and 8, which accumulated to about 4 and 2 times

374

higher levels, respectively. Strikingly, in spite of the ultimately lower yield of infectious viral

375

progeny, SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis was detected earlier and reached an overall level

376

exceeding that of SARS-CoV.

377

We also monitored viral protein production by Western blot analysis using antisera targeting

378

a non-structural (nsp3) and structural (N) protein. As expected from the RNA analysis, the

379

accumulation of both viral proteins increased with time, and was detected somewhat earlier

380

for SARS-CoV-2 than for SARS-CoV (data not shown). Overall, we conclude that in Vero E6

381

cells, SARS-CoV-2 produces levels of intracellular RNA and proteins that are at least

14

382

comparable to those of SARS-CoV, although this does not translate into the release of equal

383

amounts of infectious viral progeny (Fig. 2a).

384
385

Cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against SARS-CoV targets

386

To be able to follow virus replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells more closely, we explored

387

cross-reactivity of a variety of antisera previously raised against SARS-CoV targets, in

388

particular a variety of nsps. In an earlier study, many of those were found to cross-react also

389

with the corresponding MERS-CoV targets (35), despite the relatively large evolutionary

390

distance between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Based on the much closer relationship with

391

SARS-CoV-2, similar or better cross-reactivity of these SARS-CoV reagents was expected,

392

which was explored using immunofluorescence microscopy.

393

Indeed, most antisera recognizing SARS-CoV nsps that were tested (nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp8,

394

nsp9, nsp13, nsp15) strongly cross-reacted with the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 target (Fig.

395

4 and Table 1), the exception being a polyclonal nsp6 rabbit antiserum. Likewise, both a

396

polyclonal rabbit antiserum and mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing the N protein cross-

397

reacted strongly (Fig. 4b and Table 1). The same was true for a rabbit antiserum raised against

398

a C-terminal peptide of the SARS-CoV M protein (Fig 4e). Labelling patterns were essentially

399

identical to those previously documented for SARS-CoV (Stertz, Reichelt et al. 2007, Knoops,

400

Kikkert et al. 2008), with nsps accumulating in the perinuclear region of infected cells, where

401

the elaborate membrane structures of the viral ROs are formed (Fig. 4a, c, d). Punctate

402

structures in the same area of the cell were labelled using an antibody recognizing double-

403

stranded RNA (dsRNA), which presumably recognizes replicative intermediates of viral RNA

404

synthesis (45, 46). The N protein signal was diffusely cytosolic (Fig. 4b), whereas the M protein

405

labelling predominantly showed the expected localization to the Golgi complex (Fig. 4e), where

406

the protein is known to accumulate (47).

409

Ultrastructural characterisation of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells

410

We next used electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructural changes that SARS-CoV-

411

2 induces in infected cells, and focused on the membranous replication organelles (ROs) that

412

supports viral RNA synthesis and on the assembly and release of new virions (Fig. 5).

413

Compared to mock-infected control cells (Fig. 5a-b), various distinct membrane alterations

414

were observed in cells infected with either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5c-j). At 6 h p.i.,

415

larger regions with membrane alterations were found particularly in cells infected with SARS-

416

CoV-2 (data not shown), which may align with the somewhat faster onset of intracellular RNA

417

synthesis in SARS-CoV2-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3a). From 8 h p.i onwards, SARS-CoV-

418

and SARS-CoV-2-infected cells appeared more similar (Fig. 5c-f and 5g-j). Double-membrane

419

vesicles (DMVs) were the most prominent membrane alteration up to this stage (Fig. 5d-e and

420

and 5h-i, asterisks). In addition, convoluted membranes (45) were readily detected in SARS-

421

CoV-infected cells, while zippered ER (25, 48, 49) appeared to be the predominant structure

422

in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Fig. 5e and 5i, white arrowheads). As previously described for

423

SARS-CoV (45), also SARS-CoV-2-induced DMV appeared to fuse through their outer

424

membrane, giving rise to vesicles packets that increased in numbers as infection progressed

425

(Fig 5f and 5k, white asterisks). Virus budding near the Golgi apparatus, presumably into

426

smooth membranes of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (50-52), was

427

frequently observed at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 5k-l and 5o-p). This step is followed by transport to the

428

plasma membrane and release of virus particles into extracellular space. By 10 h p.i., released

429

progeny virions were abundantly detected around all infected cells (Fig. 5m-n and 5q-r).

430

Interestingly, whereas spikes were clearly present on SARS-CoV progeny virions, a relatively

431

large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 particles seemed to carry few or no visible spike projections

432

on their surface, perhaps suggesting a relatively inefficient incorporation of spike proteins into

433

SARS-CoV-2 virions. This could potentially reduce the yield of infectious particles and may

434

contribute to the lower progeny titres obtained for this virus (Fig. 2a).

437

Establishing a CPE-based assay to screen compounds for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

438

In order to establish and validate a CPE-based assay to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-

439

CoV-2 replication, we selected four previously identified inhibitors of CoV replication:

440

Remdesivir (53, 54), chloroquine (55, 56), Alisporivir (57, 58) and pegylated interferon alpha

441

(PEG-IFN-α) (35, 59). Cells were infected at low MOI to allow for multiple cycles of replication.

442

After three days, a colorimetric cell viability assay (60) was used to measure drug toxicity and

443

inhibition of virus replication in mock- and virus-infected cells, respectively. With the exception

444

of PEG-IFN-α, the inhibition of virus replication by compounds tested and the calculated half-

445

maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were similar for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. For

446

Remdesivir, we obtained higher EC50 values for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (4.4 and 4.5

447

µM, respectively; Fig. 6a) than previously reported by others, but this may be explained by

448

technical differences like a longer assay incubation time (72 h instead of 48 h) and the use of

449

a different read-out (cell viability instead of qRT-PCR or viral load). Based on the obtained

450

CC50 values of >100 µM, a selectivity index >22.5 was calculated. Chloroquine potently

451

blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentrations, with an EC50 value of 2.3 µM for both

452

viruses (CC50 >100 µM, SI >45.5; Fig. 6b). Alisporivir, a known inhibitor of different groups of

453

RNA viruses, was previously found to effectively reduce the production of CoV progeny. In

454

this study, we measured EC50 values of 4.9 and 4.3 µM for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,

455

respectively (Fig. 6c; CC50>100 µM, SI >20). Treatment with PEG-IFN-α completely inhibited

456

replication of SARS-CoV-2, even at the lowest dose of 7.8 ng/ml (Fig. 6d). In line with previous

457

results (35, 59), SARS-CoV was much less sensitive to PEG-IFN-α treatment, yielding only

458

partial inhibition at all concentrations tested (from 7.8 to 1000 ng/ml). Overall, we conclude

459

that Vero E6 cells provide a suitable basis to perform antiviral compound screening and select

460

the most promising hits for in-depth mechanistic studies and further development.

462

Discussion

463
464

In this report, we describe a comparative analysis of the replication features of SARS-CoV-2

465

and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, one of the most commonly used cell lines for studying these

466

two viruses. However, in contrast to the stable phenotype exhibited by SARS-CoV during our

467

17 years of working with this virus in these cells, SARS-CoV-2 began to exhibit remarkable

468

phenotypic variation in plaque assays within a few passages after its isolation from clinical

469

samples (Fig. 1a). In addition to the BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate used in this study,

470

similar observations were made for a variety of other clinical isolates (data not shown). To

471

establish the genetic basis for the observed plaque size heterogeneity, small and large

472

plaques were picked and the resulting virus clones were passaged repeatedly and analysed

473

using NGS. The consensus sequences obtained for S5p1 and L8p1, which differed by a single

474

nucleotide substitution in the S protein gene, clearly established that a single S protein

475

mutation (Arg682 to Gln) was responsible for the observed plaque size difference. This

476

mutation is localized near the so-called ‘furin-like’ S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 1b) (61) in the S

477

protein (62). This sequence constitutes a (potential) processing site that is present in a subset

478

of CoVs (including SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV) but is lacking in others, like SARS-CoV and

479

certain bat CoVs (61, 63). This polybasic motif (PRRAR↓SV, in SARS-CoV-2) can be

480

recognized by intracellular furin-like proteases during viral egress and its cleavage is thought

481

to prime the S protein for fusion and entry (64), which also requires a second cleavage event

482

to occur at the downstream S2’ cleavage site (61). In general, the presence of the furin-like

483

cleavage site does not appear to be critical for successful CoV infection. Using pseudotyped

484

virions carrying mutant S proteins of SARS-CoV (65) or SARS-CoV-2 (66), it was shown that

485

its presence minimally impacts S protein functionality. In the SARS-CoV S protein, an adjacent

486

sequence that is conserved across CoVs can be cleaved by other host proteases like

487

cathepsin L or TMPRSS2 (67-69), thus providing an alternative pathway to trigger viral entry.

488

Possibly, this pathway is also employed by our Vero E6-cell adapted SARS-CoV-2 mutants

489

that have lost the furin-like cleavage site, like clone L8p1 and multiple variants encountered in

490

S5p3 (Fig. 1a). These variants contain either single point mutations or deletions of 5 to 10 aa

491

(Fig. 1b), resembling variants recently reported by other laboratories (30, 70, 71). Interestingly

492

similar changes were also observed in some clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates that had not been

493

passaged in cell culture (70). It is currently being investigated why mutations that inactivate

494

the furin-like cleavage site provide such a major selective advantage during SARS-CoV-2

495

passaging in Vero E6 cells and how this translates into the striking large-plaque phenotype

496

documented in this paper.

497

An

498

BetaCoV/Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of a 10-nt deletion in

499

the 3’ UTR of the genome (34). Screening of other available SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

500

indicated that the presence of this deletion apparently is unique for this particular isolate, and

501

likely represents an additional adaptation acquired during cell culture passaging. This deletion

502

maps to a previously described “hypervariable region” in the otherwise conserved 3’ UTR, and

503

in particular to the so-called s2m motif (72) that is conserved among CoVs and also found in

504

several other virus groups (73, 74). The s2m element has been implicated in the binding of

505

host factors to viral RNAs, but its exact function has remained enigmatic thus far. Strikingly,

506

for the mouse hepatitis coronavirus the entire hypervariable region (including s2m) was found

507

to be dispensable for replication in cell culture, but highly relevant for viral pathogenesis in

508

mice (72). Although the impact of this deletion for SARS-CoV-2 remains to be studied in more

509

detail, these previous data suggest that this mutation need not have a major impact on SARS-

510

CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. This notion is also supported by the fact that the results of

511

our antiviral screening assays (Fig. 6) correlate well with similar studies performed with other

512

SARS-CoV-2 isolates (54, 75, 76). Clearly, this could be different for in vivo studies, for which

513

it would probably be better to rely on SARS-CoV-2 isolates not carrying this deletion in their

514

3’ UTR.

515

Vero E6 cells are commonly used to isolate, propagate, and study SARS-CoV-like viruses as

516

they support viral replication to high titres (77-81). This may be due to a high expression level

fact that they lack the ability to produce interferon (83, 84). It will be interesting to evaluate

519

whether there is a similarly strong selection pressure to adapt the S1/S2 region of the S protein

520

when SARS-CoV-2 is passaged in other cell types. Such studies are currently in progress in

521

our laboratory and already established that HuH7 cells may be a poor choice, despite the fact

522

that they were used for virus propagation (9, 85) and antiviral screening in other studies (54,

523

86). Immunolabelling of infected HuH7 cells (data not shown) revealed non-productive

524

infection of only a small fraction of the cells and a general lack of cytopathology. While other

525

cell lines are being evaluated, as illustrated above, the monitoring of the plaque phenotype

526

(plaque size and homogeneity) may provide a quick and convenient method to assess the

527

composition of SARS-CoV-2 stocks propagated in Vero E6 cells, at least where it concerns

528

the evolution of the S1/S2 region of the S protein.

529

Given the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the detailed characterization of its replication cycle

530

is an important step in understanding the molecular biology of the virus and defining potential

531

targets for inhibitors of replication. The cross-reacting antisera described in this study (Table

532

1) will be a useful tool during such studies. In general, the subcellular localization of viral nsps

533

and structural proteins (Fig. 4) and the ultrastructural changes associated with RO formation

534

(Fig. 5) were very similar for the two viruses. We also observed comparable replication kinetics

535

for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, although clearly lower final infectivity titres

536

were measured for SARS-CoV-2 (~50-fold lower; Fig. 2). Nevertheless, RNA synthesis could

537

be detected somewhat earlier for SARS-CoV-2 and the overall amount of viral RNA produced

538

exceeded that produced by SARS-CoV (Fig. 3). This may be indicative of certain assembly or

539

maturation problems or of virus-host interactions that are different in the case SARS-CoV-2.

540

These possibilities merit further investigation, in particular since our preliminary EM studies

541

suggested intriguing differences with SARS-CoV where it concerns the presence of spikes on

542

the surface of freshly released SARS-CoV-2 particles (Fig. 5n and 5r).

543

Our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNA synthesis revealed the increased relative

544

abundance of mRNAs 7 and 8 (~4- and ~2-fold, respectively) when SARS-CoV-2 was

545

compared to SARS-CoV. Mechanistically, these differences do not appear to be caused by

546

extended base pairing possibilities of the transcription regulatory sequences that direct the

547

synthesis of these two mRNAs (24). As in SARS-CoV, mRNA7 of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for

548

two proteins, the ORF7a and ORF7b proteins, with the latter presumably being expressed

549

following leaky ribosomal scanning (32). Upon its ectopic expression, the ORF7a protein has

550

been reported to induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent pathway (87) and/or to be

551

involved in cell cycle arrest (88). The ORF7b product is a poorly studied integral membrane

552

protein that has (also) been detected in virions (89). When ORF7a/b or ORF7a were deleted

553

from the SARS-CoV genome, there was a minimal impact on the kinetics of virus replication

554

in vitro in different cell lines, including Vero cells, and in vivo using mice. In another study,

555

however, partial deletion of SARS-CoV ORF7b was reported to provide a replicative

556

advantage in CaCo-2 and HuH7 cells, but not in Vero cells (90).

557

The SARS-CoV ORF8 protein is membrane-associated and able to induce endoplasmic

558

reticulum stress (91, 92), although it has not been characterised in great detail in the context

559

of viral infection. Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003, a conspicuous 29-nt (out-

560

of-frame) deletion in ORF8 was noticed in late(r) human isolates, but not in early human

561

isolates and SARS-like viruses obtained from animal sources (93-95). Consequently, loss of

562

ORF8 function was postulated to reflect an adaptation to the human host. The re-engineering

563

of an intact ORF8, using a reverse genetics system for the SARS-CoV Frankfurt-1 isolate,

564

yielded a virus with strikingly enhanced (up to 23-fold) replication properties in multiple

565

systems (96) . Clearly, it remains to be established that the increased synthesis of mRNAs 7

566

and 8 is a general feature of SARS-CoV-2 isolates, and that this indeed also translates into

567

higher expression levels of the accessory proteins encoded by ORFs 7a, 7b and 8. If

568

confirmed, these differences definitely warrant an in-depth follow-up analysis as CoV

569

accessory proteins in general have been shown to be important determinants of virulence.

570

They may thus be relevant for our understanding of the wide spectrum of respiratory disease

571

symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients (97).

572

Based on the close ancestral relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (98), one

573

might expect that the patterns and modes of interaction with host antiviral defence

574

mechanisms would be similar. However, our experiments with type I interferon treatment of

575

Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6) revealed a clear difference, with SARS-CoV-2 being considerably more

576

sensitive than SARS-CoV, as also observed by other laboratories (76). Essentially, SARS-

577

CoV-2 replication could be inhibited by similarly low concentrations of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a that

578

inhibit MERS-CoV replication in cell culture (35). Taken together, our data suggest that SARS-

579

CoV-2 is less able to counter a primed type I IFN response than SARS-CoV (76, 99).

580

Previously identified inhibitors of CoV replication were used to further validate our cell-based

581

assay for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor screening. These compounds inhibited replication at similar

582

low-micromolar concentrations and in a similar dose-dependent manner as observed for

583

SARS-CoV (Fig. 6). Remdesivir is a prodrug of an adenosine analogue developed by Gilead

584

Sciences. It was demonstrated to target the CoV RNA polymerase and act as a chain

585

terminator (100-102). The clinical efficacy of Remdesivir is still being evaluated and, after

586

some first encouraging results (103), worldwide compassionate use trials are now being

587

conducted. Likewise, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been labelled as potential

588

“game changers” and are being evaluated for treatment of severe COVID-19 patients (104).

589

Both compounds have been used to treat malaria and amebiasis (105), until drug-resistant

590

Plasmodium strains emerged (106). These compounds can be incorporated into endosomes

591

and lysosomes, raising the pH inside these intracellular compartments, which in turn may lead

592

to defects in protein degradation and intracellular trafficking (68, 107). An alternative

593

hypothesis to explain their anti-SARS-CoV activity is based on their impact on glycosylation

594

of the ACE2 receptor that is used by SARS-CoV (56). Finally, as expected, the non-

595

immunosuppressive cyclosporin A analogue Alisporivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, as

596

demonstrated previously for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (58). Although the exact mode of

597

action of this inhibitor it is unclear, it is thought to modulate CoV interactions with members of

598

the cyclophilin family (108). Unfortunately, all of these in vitro antiviral activities should

599

probably be classified as modest, emphasizing the urgency of large-scale drug repurposing

600

and discovery programmes that target SARS-CoV-2 and coronaviruses at large.

Fig. 1. Rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during passaging in Vero E6 cells. (a) Outline of

940

a plaque picking experiment that was initiated when the p2 stock of SARS-CoV-2

941

Australia/VIC01/2020 showed remarkable plaque heterogeneity on Vero E6 cells (leftmost

942

well). Following a plaque assay of the p1 virus stock, small and large plaques were picked and

943

these virus clones were passaged three times in Vero E6 cells, while their plaque phenotype

944

was monitored. In contrast to the large plaque viruses (example L8; bottom row), the plaque

945

phenotype of the small plaque viruses (example S5; top row) rapidly evolved within these 3

946

passages. (b) Evolution/adaptation of the S protein gene during Vero E6 passaging. Overview

947

of NGS data obtained for the p2 stock, S5p1/p2/p3 and S8p1 in the S1/S2 region of the SARS-

948

CoV-2 S protein gene that encodes the so-called ‘furin-like cleavage site. The analysis was

949

based on NGS reads spanning nt 23,576 to 23,665 of the SARS-CoV genome (see Methods

950

for details) and their translation in the S protein open reading frame. Deletions are indicated

951

with Δ followed by the affected amino acid residues.

(b) Analysis of the relative abundance of each of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV transcripts.

965

Phosphorimager quantification was performed for the bands of the samples isolated at 12, 14

966

and 24 h p.i., which yielded essentially identical relative abundances. The table shows the

967

average of these three measurements. SARS-CoV-2 mRNA sizes were calculated on the

968

basis of the position of the leader and body transcription-regulatory sequences (ACGAAC) in

969

the viral genome (Sawicki and Sawicki 1995, Xu, Hu et al. 2003).

973

Selected antisera previously raised against SARS-CoV nsps and structural proteins cross-

974

react with corresponding SARS-CoV-2 proteins. SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells (m.o.i.

975

of 0.3) were fixed at 12 or 24 h p.i. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were

976

(double)labelled with (a) a rabbit antiserum recognising nsp4 and a mouse mAb recognising

977

dsRNA; (b) anti-nsp4 rabbit serum and a mouse mAb directed against the N protein; (c-e)

978

rabbit antisera recognising against nsp3, nsp13 and the M protein, respectively. Nuclear DNA

979

was stained with Hoechst 33258. Bar, 20 µm.

b). (c-j) RRegions containing viral replication organelles. These virus-induced structures

985

accumulated in large clusters in the perinuclear region by 8 h p.i. (c, g, boxed regions enlarged

986

in d and h, respectively). These regions primarily contained DMVs (d-e, h-i, black asterisks).

987

Additionally, virus-induced convoluted membranes (e, white arrowhead) were observed in

988

SARS-CoV infection, whereas zippered ER (i, white arrowheads) appeared to be more

989

common in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. At 10 h p.i., vesicle packets (f, j, white asterisks),

990

which seem to arise by fusion of two or more DMVs through their outer membrane, became

991

abundant in the RO regions. (k-r) Examples of virion assembly and release in infected cells.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication (coloured bars) was tested in Vero E6 cells by developing

1001

a CPE-reduction assay and evaluating several previously identified inhibitors of SARS-CoV,

1002

which was included for comparison (grey bars). For each compound a two-fold serial dilution

1003

series in the low-micromolar range was tested; (a) Remdesivir, (b) chloroquine, (c) Alisporivir

1004

and (d) pegylated interferon alpha-2. Cell viability was assayed using the CellTiter 96®

1005

Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (MTS assay). Compound toxicity (solid line)

1006

was evaluated in parallel using mock-infected, compound-treated cells. The graphs show the

results of 3 independent experiments, each performed using quadruplicate samples (mean ±

1008
