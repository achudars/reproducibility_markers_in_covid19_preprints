Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus 2019
(COVID-19). No treatment is available. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in mesenchymal stem cellderived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are potential novel therapeutic agents because of their
ability to regulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA. Thus, they may degrade the RNA
genome of SARS-CoV-2. EVs can transfer miRNAs to recipient cells and regulate conditions
within them. MSC-EVs harbor major therapeutic miRNAs that play important roles in the
biological functions of virus-infected host cells. Here, we examined their potential impact on
viral and immune responses. MSC-EVs contained 18 miRNAs predicted to interact directly with
the 3' UTR of SARS-CoV-2. These EVs suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells.
In addition, five major miRNAs suppressed virus activity in a luciferase reporter assay by
binding the 3' UTR. MSC-EVs showed strong regenerative effects and potent anti-inflammatory
activity which may prevent lethal cytokine storms. We confirmed that EVs regulated
inflammatory responses by several cell types, including human brain cells that express the viral
receptor ACE2, suggesting that the brain may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. miRNAs in MSCEVs have several advantages as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2: 1) they bind
specifically to the viral 3' UTR, and are thus unlikely to have side effects; 2) because the 3' UTR
is highly conserved and rarely mutates, MSC-EV miRNAs could be used against novel variants
arising during viral replication; and 3) unique cargoes carried by MSC-EVs can have diverse
effects, such as regenerating damaged tissue and regulating immunity.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the positive sense single-stranded RNA
virus that causes coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 is a variant of the coronavirus SARS-CoV,
which is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus known to
infect humans; the others are 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-CoV, and the original SARS-CoV. SARSCoV-2 is a Sarbeco virus (β-CoV strain B) with an RNA genome of about 30,000 bases. The virus attaches to
the angiotensin converting enzyme 2β (ACE2) receptor on human cells. After binding to a host cell, the cellular
protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the viral spike protein to release the fusion peptide. Then the virion releases RNA
into the cell, leading to virus replication and infection of other cells. Since SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the
causative agent of COVID-19, scientists have sought to understand the genetic composition of the virus and to
find ways to effectively treat the infection. No specific treatments for COVID-19 have been developed. Various
treatments have been proposed, and some approved drugs appear to be associated with positive results; however,
more work is required before a viable treatment can be deployed in the clinic. Developing new vaccines takes
time, and clinical trials require rigorous testing and safety tests. The RNA genome has a high rate of mutation,
making RNA viruses very heterogeneous [1]. The mutation rate of viral RNA is about 1 million times greater
than that of human DNA [2]. Consequently, RNA viruses show large genetic diversity, a property important for
their survival [3, 4]. The high frequency of viral gene mutations makes it difficult to develop therapeutic agents.
For example, antibody-based therapeutics developed against one variant must be redesigned after the virus
mutates. Consequently, influenza vaccines need to be updated annually. Also, viral variants develop resistance
to antiviral drugs, and mild virus variants become virulent spontaneously. Consequently, therapeutic and
preventive agents that can cope with viral mutations are needed urgently.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of 18–25 nucleotides (nts); these small molecules are
important regulators of gene expression because they suppress messenger (m)RNAs. miRNAs regulate
approximately 30–70% of human gene expression by matching their “seed” sequence with complementary
mRNA [5]. Alongside the regulation of human gene expression, miRNAs bind directly to viral RNA genomes
or affect viral replication by mediating changes in the host genome. Several miRNAs bind directly to a wide
range of RNA viruses and modulate pathogenesis [6]. In addition, the seed sequence, which is located at the 5'
end of the miRNA, binds to a complementary sequence within the 3' UTR of the invading viral RNA [7]. A
perfect match between miRNA and the whole mRNA target sequence leads to RNA cleavage, although this is
rare in mammals [7]. More often, exact seed sequence matching results in translational inhibition, followed by
RNA degradation [8, 9]. Only seven nucleotides within a miRNA sequence are required to bind target mRNAs
because either partial or perfect binding between miRNA and mRNA results in the degradation of the target
mRNA strand [10, 11]. EVs are small membrane-bound bodies that contain cargoes such as nucleic acids,
proteins, lipids, and metabolites [12]. Release of EVs is an important form of intercellular communication that
plays roles in the physiological and pathological processes underlying multiple diseases. One of the most
fascinating features of EVs is their ability to transfer miRNAs to recipient cells and regulate cell conditions [1315]. For example, miRNAs delivered by EVs to both immune cells and other cell types repress or degrade target
mRNAs in recipient cells [16-18].
The regulatory or regenerative functions of miRNAs contained in stem cell-derived EVs have attracted attention
as a novel therapeutic approach [19]. EVs secreted from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mediate tissue
regeneration and help to repair damage in a variety of diseases, including cardiac ischemia, liver fibrosis, and
cerebrovascular disease. Multiple studies report the therapeutic effects of miRNAs delivered to host cells by
MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs transport proteins, ncRNA, miRNAs, and lipids, which mediate cardiac tissue repair and

regulate the environment around damaged tissue, induce angiogenesis, promote proliferation, and prevent
apoptosis [20, 21]. When SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the ACE2 receptor to invade a host cell, immune cells such
as T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) secrete and absorb EVs containing miRNAs that attack the infected
viral RNA. Thus, delivery of miRNA by MSC-EVs represents a new therapeutic mechanism for combating
SARS-CoV-2 and regulating the pro-inflammatory environment.
Here, we identified candidate therapeutic miRNAs with important roles in the biological functions of virusinfected host cells, and characterized the antiviral effects of miRNAs derived from placenta-derived MSC-EVs
(pMSC-EVs) or placenta EVs, which exhibit potent regenerative and anti-inflammatory effects. Five selected
miRNAs (miR-92a-3p, miR-103a-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-26a-5p, and miR-23a-3p) blocked SARS-CoV-2 RNA
replication and suppressed virus-mediated pro-inflammatory responses by human bronchial epithelial cells and
lung fibroblasts, all of which express ACE2 receptors. These effects were also observed in human brain cells
and brain immune cells. Interestingly, we found that ACE2 is expressed in human fetal brain stem cells,
suggesting that the brain could be target of SARS-CoV-2. Most importantly, we found that the five miRNAs
bound to the 3' UTR of SARS-CoV-2, the sequence of which is conserved among coronaviruses.
Results
Antiviral effect of EVs against SARS-CoV-2Viral infections cause a variety of cellular reactions, and viruses
themselves are known to create an environment that allows for replication and spread. In addition, the virus
causes apoptosis, and the completed virus is easily transmitted. In addition, host cells are known to secrete
various cytokines and stimulate immune cells by their protective action. Consequently, it is very important to
break down viral replication before stimulation of inflammatory cytokines. Figure 1 shows the hypothesis,
which asserts the antiviral effect of miRNA in EVs and EVs against SARS-CoV-2, and explains how miRNA
directly degrades viruses and indirectly suppresses excessive immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 viruses invade
cells through ACE2 receptors. They penetrate cells by binding to these receptors and transporting viral RNAs
into the cytoplasm where they replicate. When the cell recognizes viral RNAs in the cytoplasm, it secretes
cytokines, induces an immune fraction, and stimulates immune cells to fight the viral infection. However, if too
much cytokine is secreted due to excessive stimulation, the immune cells are over-activated and can, damage
normal cells and tissues. Resulting in a phenomenon is referred to as a cytokine storm. EVs enter cells through
various pathways, including membrane fusion, receptor-mediated uptake, and active endocytosis. We
demonstrated that key miRNAs expressed in MSC-EVs degrade SARS-CoV-2 RNAs by interacting directly
with the 3' UTR. In addition, the miRNAs in EVs exerted an anti-inflammatory effect, which prevented the
cytokine storms by dampening the excessive immune response caused by the virus (Fig. 1, left panel).
Specifically, the direct effects of EV miRNAs against SARS-CoV-2 virus regulation are mediated by targeting
regions within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including the 3' UTR, the 5' UTR, and coding sequences. Particularly,
direct binding to the 3' UTR is predicted to down-regulate SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In addition, EVs regenerate
damaged tissue and regulate the pro-inflammatory environment via their miRNAs and protein cargoes,
indicating their potential to suppress cytokine storms caused by viral infection (Fig. 1, right panel). Cargoes
including miRNAs in MSC-EVs attenuate induced inflammation and apoptosis caused by SARS-CoV-2, and
suppress the expression of transcription/translation machinery involved in virus replication and translation,
thereby indirectly suppressing the action of virus.
EVs isolated from placental stem cells (pMSCs) were positive for the common EV marker CD63 (Suppl. Fig.
1A). The hydrodynamic diameter of EVs measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was 121.8 nm
(Suppl. Fig. 1B) and a representative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image exhibited the typical EV
morphology (Suppl. Fig. 1C). In addition, Western blotting detected typical EV markers, including CD81,

CD63, TSG101, and CD9 (Suppl. Fig. 1D). To verify the effect of EVs against SARS-CoV-2, we first
examined the cytotoxicity of EVs in an MTT assay using Vero cells. Vero cells were treated for 24 h with twofold serial dilutions of EVs (0.003-4.7 μg). No cytotoxicity was observed at any concentration tested and rather
cells proliferated after treatment with EVs at all doses (Fig. 2A, Ps < 0.05). Subsequently, we developed a 96well plate assay in which live cells were stained with crystal violet, whereas cells showing virus-mediated
Cytopathic Effect (CPE) were not. To confirm the cytotoxic concentration of SARS-CoV-2, Vero cells were
infected with the virus (10-fold serial dilutions: 101 TCID50/well, 10 2 TCID50/well, and 103 TCID50/well, n=3
replicates) and incubated for 3 days. The amount of cell death after 3 days was confirmed by examining CPE.
Cell detachment was observed at doses of 10 1 TCID50/well to 10 3 TCID50/well (Fig. 2B, left panel). Next, we
examined the antiviral effects of EVs against SARS-CoV-2 at three different TCID50 concentrations. EVs at 5
μg, 2.5 μg, and 1.25 μg showed 100%, 100%, and 66% efficacy, respectively, at the titer of 101 TCID50. EVs at
5 μg and 2.5 μg showed 66% and 33% efficacy, respectively, at a titer of 102 TCID50. However, EVs did not
show antiviral activity at a virus titer of 103 TCID50 (Fig. 2B, right panel).
Viruses infecting the respiratory system can invade cells expressing the ACE2 receptor, resulting in cell damage.
Because ACE2 receptors are expressed primarily in the liver, kidneys, male reproductive tissue, muscle, and the
gastrointestinal tract (GI), these organs can be damaged by such viruses (Suppl. Fig. 2A, B). Although
expression of ACE2 in the brain has not been studied in detail and the Brain Atlas database suggests that
expression is very low (Suppl. Fig. 2A, B), clinical outcomes continue to suggest that the brain might be a
target of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Neuronal stem cells (NSCs) strongly express ACE2 receptors (Suppl.
Fig. 2C) at levels comparable with known virus target organs, such as LL24, indicating that the brain is a target
organ for SARS-CoV-2. To determine whether EVs regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to
SARS-CoV-2, we examined their indirect antiviral effects on these various cell types such as LL24, Beas-2B,
and NSCs including brain immune cells (microglia cells; BV2), expected to be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. EVs
labeled with PKH26 were observed after 24 h. Based on the results, the next experiments were conducted using
an EV treatment time of 24 h (Suppl. Fig. 2D). Cells treated with EVs significantly reduced inflammation
stimulated by Lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Expression of IL-1β and IL-6 in LL24 and Beas-2B cells (Fig. 2C
and D, Ps < 0.05), of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in BV2 cells (Fig. 2E, Ps < 0.01), and IL-1β and IL-6 in NSCs
(Fig. 2F, Ps < 0.05) fell significantly, whereas expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in cells not pre-treated
with EVs increased after exposure to LPS. These results suggest that EV treatment may prevent cytokine storms
caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. NF-κB is a major transcription factor stimulated by LPS. Under normal
conditions, NF-κB is located within the cytoplasm. Upon activation, the IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα,
leading to translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. Although NF-κB is an important regulator of immune
responses, we found that expression of mRNA encoding NF-κB was not affected by EVs after LPS stimulation.
Therefore, we examined the translocation of NF-κB protein. NF-κB was translocated into nucleus in LPS
treated Beas-2B cells, but was sequestered in the cytoplasm after EVs treatment (Fig. 2G). In addition,
expression of NF-κB phospho-p65 in Beas-2B cells increased upon treatment with LPS and decreased after
treatment with LPS and EVs; however, total p65 expression was unchanged (Fig. 2H). These results suggest
that EVs regulate the inflammatory responses by blocking the NF-κB signaling pathway and p65 translocation.
miRNAs in EVs directly bind to 3' UTR of SARS-CoV-2
To find the mechanism of EV's antiviral effect, we first analyzed miRNAs within EVs. Based on the fact that
the viral genome can be targeted by human miRNAs, we hypothesized that miRNAs within EVs directly
interact with the SARS-CoV-2 genome. EVs obtained from eight MSCs under various cell culture methods and
from six placenta derivatives were assessed by small RNA sequencing. Quality control of EV sequencing

results was performed using the qrqc R package. The distribution of small RNAs (expressed as a percentage)
was obtained using sRNAtoolbox. Unassigned reads were most common, followed by miRNAs and tRNAs,
indicating that miRNAs are the major cargoes in EVs (Suppl. Fig. 3A-F).
The profiles of miRNA in EVs obtained from eight placenta MSCs and six placental derivatives EVs (PD-EVs)
were very similar (Fig. 3A). MSC-EVs miRNAs were profiled using small RNA sequencing and ranked
(highest to lowest) in terms of counts per million (CPM) (Fig. 3B). Read counts between biological replicates
showed a strong correlation (Fig. 3C). The top 18 miRNAs accounted for 80.1% of all EV miRNAs (Fig. 3D).
The remaining miRNAs were excluded from further analysis because they were present at very low read counts
and comprised a very small percentage of the total reads (0.02–0.96%), and consequently were deemed
unlikely to have significant biological effect relative to the more abundant miRNAs. The number of genes
targeted by the top 18 miRNAs and the number of targeted genes related to the inflammatory response are listed
in Figure 3E. In addition, the number of inflammatory response genes targeted was further assessed and the
results of enriched pathway analysis were also shown in Figure 3E. The majority of the genes contributed
substantially to specific inflammatory responses related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, TNF, NF- B,
chemokines, Toll-like receptors, and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, indicating that their key function is
immunomodulation (Fig. 3E). The miRNAs affecting the most targets related to inflammatory responses were
miR-92a-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-24-3p, miR-let-7b-5p, miR-let7a-5p, and miR-181a-5p. Moreover, the expression
levels of 84 common miRNAs present in EVs derived from eight MSCs cultured under various conditions and
six placental derivatives were very consistent across samples (Suppl. Table 1).
To explore the possibility that miRNAs within EVs interact with the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR, we investigated
whether the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR contains potential miRNA binding sites. We aligned the 3' UTR sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Fig. 4 A) and analyzed the alignment using PITA software. Table 1 shows information
about binding sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and the results of binding prediction analyses. PITA software
identified 18 miRNAs predicted to target the 3 UTR of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) and 28 miRNAs with sequences
expected to bind to whole genome sites within the SARS-CoV-2 (Suppl. Table 2). Five miRNAs: miR-92a-3p,
miR-26a-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-103a-3p, and miR-181a-5p out of 17 miRNAs were selected based on the
thermodynamic energy score and high scores in two prediction tools: PITA and miRDB. Each of the candidate
sites was assigned a logistic probability as a measure of confidence. We obtained the total free energy of each
miRNA, based upon that the lower the binding thermodynamic energy (kcal/mol), the stronger the binding. For
example, the binding energy of miR-181a-5p for the 3' UTR was -18.7 kcal/mol, suggesting that binding of
miRNA to the 3' UTR binding would proceed spontaneously. PITA and miRDB predicted potential binding
sites for miR-92a-3p, miR-26a-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-103a-3p, and miR-181a-5p in the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR
(Fig. 4B). Next, we performed qPCR analysis to determine whether these five miRNAs were present in EVs
(Fig. 4C). The results confirmed that EVs expressed these miRNAs. To demonstrate the five miRNAs directly
bind the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR and suppress the RNA replication, a luciferase reporter assay was developed. A
PCR fragment was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid between the luciferase ORF and the synthetic
poly(A) sequence. 'recombinant plasmid was named pGL3 SARS-CoV-2 3'-UTR_Luc (Fig. 4D). The
recombinant plasmid was transfected into human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cells, and luciferase activity
was measured 48 h later. As shown in Figure 4E, relative luciferase activity in SK-N-BE(2)C cells transfected
with the recombinant plasmids was significantly lower than that in cells transfected with the empty psi-control
vector (Ps < 0.001). Specifically, relative luciferase activity was downregulated when 3' UTR was cotransfected
along with expression vectors containing each of the five miRNAs or a vector containing all five miRNAs. The
results show a significant decrease in the luciferase activity mediated by the psi-59 UTR (Fig. 4E). These data
clearly indicate that each of the five miRNAs was able to silence the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR. Taken together, the

results, suggest that all five miRNAs bind directly to the 3' UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and degrade the SARS-CoV2 viral genome. Based on these results, the five miRNAs tested all directly bind to the 3' UTR of SARS-CoV-2
and degrade the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome further suggesting that either each of miR-92a-3p, miR-26a-5p,
miR-23a-3p, miR-103a-3p, and miR-181a-5p or five miRNAs represent potential therapeutic agents for SARSCoV-2.
Enrichment analysis of biological processes targeted by the five miRNAs in EVs is shown in Figure 4F. Nodes
represent individual genes associated with significantly enriched biological processes and the miRNAs that
target them were connected by the edges. Genes related to transcription and immune regulation (including antiinflammatory genes) are shown as blue and green circles, respectively, and genes with overlapping
contributions to transcription and immune regulation are shown as red circles (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, all five
miRNAs had dual roles in transcription and immune regulation, further confirming that they have the potential
to both degrade SARS-CoV-2 via the direct binding with the 3' UTR and regulation of the inflammatory
environment created by viral infection. Based on the enrichment analysis of the five miRNA target genes in
Figure 4F, the five miRNAs had the function of immune regulation. We further examined whether either each
of the five miRNAs within the EVs regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release in response to SARS-CoV-2.
LL24 and Beas-2B were exposed to either each of five or all of miRNAs, followed by LPS treatment.
Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was measured. Only miR-181a-5p exhibited significant reduction of
IL-1β in Beas-2B (Fig. 4G, p < 0.0003); and IL-6 in LL-24 cells (Fig. 4H, p < 0.0005); the other four miRNAs
did not reduce expression of pro-inflammatory factors. Interestingly, the increase in TNF-⍺ induced by the
inflammatory response was marginally significantly reduced by miR-181a-5p in Beas-2B (Fig. 4G, p < 0.01)
and in LL-24 (Fig. 4H, p < 0.06). Furthermore, we found transfection of miR-181a-5p reduced NF-κB
translocation to the nucleus markedly in Beas-2B cells (Fig. 4I). Next, we analyzed the processes and pathways
targeted by the five miRNAs. The mirTarBase predicted that the five miRNAs targeted 2698 genes. GO term
analysis using DAVID indicated that the functions of the targeted genes involved both positive and negative
regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoters, as well as other transcription-related functions
(Suppl Fig. 4A and B). KEGG pathway analysis of the 2698 targets revealed significant enrichment of
pathways related to aging (cell cycle, p53) and inflammation (PI3K, Wnt, TGF). We detected significant
enrichment in pathways related to inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-⍺, cytokine-cytokine receptors, and
chemokine receptors. Interestingly, RNA degradation, RNA transport, protein processing in the ER, and TGF-β
were also enriched (Suppl. Fig. 4C-F). Some RNA viruses target the nuclear pore complex, thereby inhibiting
RNA transport. The inhibition of RNA transport in the nuclear pore complex prevents influx of new mRNA into
the cytosol, thereby reducing competition for the translation machinery and attenuating responses to viral
infection [22]. By preventing suppression of RNA transport, which is a survival strategy for some viruses, the
five miRNAs might prevent formation of an environment favorable for viral replication. The RNA degradation
pathway mainly targets genes related to the CCR4 NOT complex, which is involved in RNA homeostasis and
removal of unnecessary mRNA from cytoplasmic exosomes. Given that inflammation-specific mRNAs are not
cleared from CNOT3 knockout mice [23], the five miRNAs may stimulate clearance by targeting those RNAs
for degradation (Suppl. Fig. 4D). Upon infection with hepatitis C virus, ER stress markers are upregulated and
proapoptotic markers are expressed [24]. The five miRNAs regulated expression of genes related to ER stress
caused by virus infection (Suppl. Fig. 4E). Influenza A virus increases expression of TGF-β and promotes cell
proliferation, thereby increasing the number of cells expressing integrin subunit ⍺5 and fibronectin, to which
bacteria adhere. In addition, the innate immune system suppresses expression of the TGF-beta receptor and the
SMAD pathway via IRF3 during virus infection [25, 26]. By preventing suppression of this pathway, the five
miRNAs normalized the local environment around virus-infected cells (Suppl. Fig. 4F). Of the 2698 targets, we
selected 83 genes associated with the GO term ‘inflammatory response’, and then performed KEGG pathway
7

analysis to further identify the pathways in which they are involved: these were interleukin production and
regulation, cell chemotaxis, and response to external stress (Suppl. Fig. 4A and B). Moreover, the 83 genes
were implicated in signal pathways related to cytokine production (e.g., the NF-κB pathway, the JNK pathway,
and the toll-like receptor pathway) (Suppl. Fig. 5A-G). In addition, they target important inflammationinducing factors such as IL-6, IL-8, and COX2. These data indicate that the five miRNAs regulate cytokinemediated inflammatory responses and inflammatory cell activation, as well as pathways related to cytokine
secretion, thereby dampening the inflammatory environment. Taken together, the above data suggest that the
five miRNAs regulate the inflammatory environment and degrade viral genomic RNA through direct binding to
the 3' UTR of SARS-CoV-2.
3' UTRs of corona virus are highly conserved
Next, since the 3' UTR sequence is conserved among corona viruses, and considering the hypothesis that a
functional miRNA target site would be conserved across all corona viruses, we selected 3' UTR sequences from
five random coronaviruses and compared them using the MUSLCE tool [27]. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 3'
UTR of SARS-CoV-2 was aligned against the other coronaviruses. The red boxes indicate miRNA binding sites
and sites predicted to bind the five miRNAs were also highly conserved (Fig. 5A).
To confirm that the SARS-CoV-2 genomic mutation also occurs in the miRNA binding site of the 3' UTR, the
site of the 3' UTR sequence in the recently generated mutant SARS-COV-2 was obtained from data reported in
a recent paper [28]. According to, mutation of the 3' UTR is found rarely in SARS-CoV-2 samples collected
from China and Japan, whereas samples from Australia showed deletion of the 3' UTR (Fig. 5B). Specifically,
among the mutations, a total of 5 cases with 3' UTR mutation were detected: 29705G>T, 29854C>T,
29856T>A, 29869del and 29749-29759del with the most common type mutation was single nucleotide
mutation. Most sites within the SARS-CoV-2 3' UTR that bind miRNAs are not mutated, whereas the binding
sites of hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-92a-3p, hsa-miR-92b-3p, and hsa-miR-25-3p were mutated in the SARSCoV-2 samples from Australia. However, in the case of hsa-miR-92a-3p, two binding sites are predicted in the
3' UTR; one of these binding sites is known to harbor none of the mutations found in any of the variants in
China, Japan, and Australia. These results suggest that most miRNAs are rarely affected by known 3' UTR
mutations (Fig. 5B). Next, to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 complete genome from Korean patients, we used
NCBI GenBank. Mutation of 3’ UTR was not detected in six complete genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolated form
Korean patients which were recently submitted to GenBank from 2020-February until 2020-July. (Fig. 5C).
In summary, considering the high miRNA binding rate, and that the 3' UTR of various coronaviruses rarely
harbor mutations, the five selected miRNAs have the potential to suppress all coronaviruses, including those
arising via mutation. Furthermore, several miRNAs in MSC-EVs interact with other viruses. Specifically, miR150-5p, miR-223-3p, and miR-29a-3p suppress HIV translation and prolong its latency in T cells. In addition,
Let-7c-5p reduces expression of matrix protein, which is critical for influenza virus, and miR-23b-3p blocks
translation of Enterovirus 71. miR-181a-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-23b-3p, and miR-378a-3p degrade
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, whereas miR-122-5p and let-7c-5p suppress hepatitis C
virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus, respectively (Fig. 5D). Consequently, the presence of miRNAs in MSCEVs that are capable of attacking various RNA-based viruses suggests that MSC-EVs can be used to treat
and/or prevent virus infection.

Discussion
As yet, there is no vaccine or treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, symptomatic and maintenance
therapies are the standard of care. While an effective and safe treatment for patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection is required urgently, SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus and as such is likely to undergo frequent mutation.
Therefore, vaccines or treatments must also be effective against newly arising mutant viruses. Here, we
demonstrate that miRNAs in EVs suppress SARS-CoV-2 by binding directly to the 3' UTR, resulting in
translational repression (Fig. 3). EVs prevent cytokine storms by normalizing inflammatory responses. In
addition, each individual (or all five together) miRNA is predicted to interact directly with the 3' UTR of SARSCoV-2, which was confirmed by significant inhibition of a luciferase reporter construct derived from the 3'
UTR (Fig. 4). Moreover, EVs or miRNAs modulated host factors to normalize immunopathogenesis. More
specifically, 84 miRNAs present in EVs exerted potent indirect effects by targeting mRNAs that stimulate the
immune response. Binding of target pro-inflammatory mRNAs, along with the anti-inflammatory factors
contained in EVs, could normalize the immune environment, and prevent cytokine storms.
Recent studies of the antiviral effects of miRNAs reveal that miRNA in host cells interacts directly with viral
RNA to prevent its replication [29]. In addition, even if miRNAs do not interact directly with viral RNA, they
can still suppress expression of viral target receptors, thereby subverting virus cell tropism. Furthermore, these
miRNAs can regulate the replication and translation machinery involved in virus replication and inhibit viral
infection by controlling inflammation and apoptosis, both of which promote the spread of assembled virus
particles [30]. In addition, because miRNAs have sequences complementary to their targets, efforts have been
made to control only specific target mRNAs using miRNAs. Exogenous miRNA is stable in vivo and is able to
regulate its target [29]. However, studies of drug delivery systems are actively being conducted because it is
necessary to localize miRNAs to the target tissue, delivery it to cells, and avoid nuclease degradation. To
address these issues, some groups have tried modifying miRNAs. However, when such modifications are made,
they create other problems, including off-target effects, reduction in miRNA activity, and formation of toxic
metabolites due to miRNA degradation [31]. Consequently, a miRNA (small RNA)-based treatment was not
released until 2018, when the FDA approved a drug called Patisiran (ONPATTRO, NCT01960348). Currently
efforts are underway to develop lipid nanoparticles that can be delivered to target cells following intravenous
(IV) injection (hepatocytes) allowing the efficient transfer of miRNA [32]. As research on extracellular vesicles
advances, the paracrine and regenerative effects of stem cells mediated via EVs have been demonstrated [33].
Because EVs are natural vesicles they are considered to be safer and more effective than artificial alternatives.
Therapeutic agents based on miRNAs derived from EVs have several advantages as therapeutic agents. First, a
major problem with conventional treatments for RNA-based viruses is that they have potentially fatal side
effects. Clinical trials conducted to date show that existing viral treatments have strong side effects [34], making
them inappropriate for treatment of patients with mild cases; moreover, the side effects make it difficult to give
antiviral drugs in doses high enough to yield the desired effect. In contrast, due to specific binding to the 3'
UTR or to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, miRNAs derived from EVs are unlikely to have significant side effects.
Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the side effects of existing antiviral agents and to develop more virusspecific drugs. As mentioned above, a miRNA-based agent has already been approved by the FDA, and the
interaction between miRNA and RNA viruses has been proven, which makes therefore, the possibility of
treatment is high. Moreover, because mutations in the 3' UTR of the virus are very rare, this approach has the
potential to become a universal treatment for novel RNA viruses arising via mutation of the viral RNA. Our
study demonstrates that the 3' UTR sequence is highly conserved across the corona virus family (Fig. 5A), and
that binding sites predicted to bind the five miRNAs are also highly conserved (Fig. 5A and B). These results
give us confidence that the five selected miRNAs will be effective against novel viruses arising though mutation.

Third, in addition to the direct antiviral effects of miRNA, MSC-EVs can transport various cargoes that can
regulate immunity and promote regeneration of damaged tissue.
MSCs have attracted attention as COVID-19 therapeutics because several lines of evidence show that they can
significantly improve the pathological state of damaged lungs, including pneumonia; in addition, they have the
ability to activate phagocytosis by macrophages, thereby preventing virus spread [35]. Furthermore, because
MSC-EVs contain factors that can regenerate stem cells, they exhibit some of the biological properties of MSCs,
and express surface receptors, signal transduction molecules, cell adhesion molecules, miRNAs, and antigens
characteristics of MSCs [36, 37], they will have effects against pneumonia similar to those of MSCs [38].
Furthermore, MSCs regulate the function of immune cells and accordingly are considered potential treatments
for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. According to numerous experimental and clinical studies, most
MSC-based immunomodulatory functions can be attributed to the immunomodulatory properties of the EVs
that they secrete. MSC-EVs are rich in biologically active molecules such as mRNA, miRNA, cytokines, and
immune modulators, which regulate the function, phenotype, and viability of immune cells [39]. MSC-EVs with
immune regulatory activity are also used to study degenerative, chronic, and infectious diseases. For example,
when pigs infected with the influenza virus were treated with MSC-EVs, virus outflow (as detected by nasal
swab) decreased, virus replication in the lungs diminished, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production was
reduced significantly [40]. Because host immune responses in severe COVID-19 patients are exacerbated by
pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and impaired type I interferon activity, which can trigger a
potentially fatal cytokine storm, a hallmark of severe COVID-19 according to several reports, they provide a
rationale for therapeutic approaches based on EVs. In addition, a recent study reported that a multi-system
inflammatory syndrome in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 results in a life-threatening disease. Therefore,
it is very critical to control the inflammatory syndrome before and after virus infection [41].
Indeed, our study demonstrates that EVs from MSCs and various placental derivatives successfully inhibit
secretion of pro-inflammatory factors (Fig. 2, 4, and suppl Fig. 4 and 5). The genes targeted by each of the top
miRNAs contribute substantially to specific inflammatory responses (Fig. 3E) related to cytokine-cytokine
receptor interactions, TNF secretion, NF- B activation, chemokine secretion, Toll-like receptor expression, and
the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, indicating that their key function is immunomodulation (Suppl Fig. 5).
Specifically, miR-let-7b-5b, miR-21-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-24-3p, and miR-181a-5p bind the most targets
related to inflammatory responses.
MSC-EVs have several other advantages over MSCs [39]. First, MSC-EVs are easier to manipulate and store
[42]. Also, because MSC-EVs are cell-free and nano-sized, they are far less likely to trigger immunogenicity,
tumorigenicity, or embolism. Because they are essentially liposomes, EVs are simple biological structures that
are more stable in vivo than other particles [43]. Moreover, EVs invade host cells directly through membrane
fusion, receptor-mediated phagocytosis, and other internalization mechanisms, which contribute to
physiological and pathological processes such as activation of signaling pathways and immune responses [44].
Taken together, the observations reported herein suggest that MSC-EVs are an effective antiviral treatment.
More interestingly, some of miRNAs in EVs are possible therapeutic agents for other RNA viruses (Fig. 5B).
Miravirsen illustrated that miRNAs that interact directly with RNA viral genomes can be used to treat hepatitis
C infection; indeed, the drug has successfully completed a phase II clinical trial. Moreover, because various
miRNAs present in MSC-EVs can be used to target RNA genomes with complementary sites in their 3' UTRs,
they could be used to treat infections caused by other coronaviruses, hepatitis viruses, and HIV-based RNA
viruses (Fig. 5C).

Although MSC-EVs are expected to be effective for antiviral therapy and immune enhancement, one major
obstacle to their widespread use is that they are difficult to mass-produce [45]. To mass-produce EVs
consistently, it will be necessary to establish reproducible culture conditions and scale up the system in an
economically viable manner. Moreover, mass production of EVs is limited by the challenge of producing MSCs
themselves. However, in this study, we showed that the miRNA profiles of MSC-EVs and placental derivatives
EVs are very similar. Consequently, it should be possible to obtain more EVs than cells by isolating placental
derivatives EVs. Alternatively, it might be possible to synthesize effective miRNAs and package them into EVs
to increase treatment efficacy.
To summarize, we demonstrated that EVs and five major miRNAs significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication and exert anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. Moreover, EVs regulate the pro-inflammatory
environment induced by viral infection and suppress replication of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the antiviral
effect of EVs, EVs and miRNAs prevented spread of the virus when administered prior to a pro-inflammatory
agent (LPS).
Materials and Methods
Isolation of human brain neuronal stem cells and placental MSCs
Neuronal stem cells were generated from the central nervous system tissue of spontaneously fetus from ectopic
pregnancy at during the gestational week (GW) 8 with mother's consent (IRB 2009-06-074). Isolation method is
described in Moon et al [46]. Normal human placenta (≥37 GW) showing no evidence of medical, obstetrical,
or surgical complications were obtained. All donors provided written, informed consent. Sample collection and
use for research purposes were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB, 2015-08-130-016) of
Bundang CHA General Hospital (Seongnam, Korea).
Isolation of EVs
EVs were first isolated by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 30 min using in an 10K MCWO spin column (Merk
Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) and then filtered through a qEV original size exclusion column (Izon Science
Ltd, Burnside, Christchurch, New Zealand). The qEV original size exclusion column was removed from storage
at 4°C and the 20% ethanol storage solution was allowed to run through the column followed by 20 mL
particle-free PBS. Samples were diluted to 500 µL with particle-free PBS and then overlaid on the qEV size
exclusion column, followed by elution with particle-free PBS. The flow was collected in 500 µL fractions, and
EV-rich fractions 7 and 10 were combined for analysis. The combined fractions were centrifuged at 1,000 × g
for 1 min in an Ultrafree 0.22 μm centrifugal filter device (Merk Millipore).
Fluorescence imaging of EVs
EVs were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC LC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Biotinylated EVs were loaded onto Zeba spin desalting columns (7 K MWCO; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
to remove the remaining free biotin. For staining, 20 μL of biotinylated EVs were placed in a circle drawn on a
streptavidin-coated glass slide (Arrayit Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). After 30 min, EVs were fixed with
BD Fix Perm (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and blocked with 0.2% BSA-PBS. Immunofluorescence
staining was performed using anti-human CD 63 (1:100; SC-5275, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)
for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.

TEM imaging
Five-microliter aliquots of diluted sample containing 0.5 µg protein (as determined by BCA assay) were
dropped onto hydrophilic grids. After a few minutes, the grids were washed with distilled water and contrasted
for 20 sec with 2% uranyl acetate. Images were acquired on a JEM-1010 microscope (JEOL, Seoul, Korea)
operating at 80 kV.
Nanoparticle tracking analysis
EVs were diluted in PBS (final volume, 1 mL) and examined under a ZetaView Nanoparticle Tracking Video
Microscope (Particle Metrix, Inning, Germany). The software manufacturer’s default settings for EVs or
nanoparticles were selected. For each measurement, three cycles were performed by scanning 11 cell positions
and capturing 60 frames per position (video setting: high). The following settings were used: focus, autofocus;
camera sensitivity for all samples, 80.0; shutter, 100; scattering intensity, 1.2; cell temperature, 23°C. After
capture, the videos were analyzed using the built-in ZetaView Software 8.02.31 with the following parameters:
maximum particle size, 1000; minimum particle size, 5.
Western blotting
EVs were lysed in 10× RIPA buffer containing a protease cocktail tablet (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and
phosphatase inhibitors II and III (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA assay
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 20 μg aliquot of each sample was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by
western blotting. Blots were blocked for 1 h in 10% skim milk/TBS-T. Antibodies specific for the following
proteins were obtained from the indicated suppliers: CD81 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
USA), CD9 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD63 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) TSG 101 (1:500,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Vinculin (1:2,000, Abcam). Cells were lysed in 1× RIPA buffer containing a protease
cocktail tablet and phosphatase inhibitors II and III. Next, 10 μg of protein was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE
gels, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore), and analyzed by western blotting with antibodies
specific for p65 (1:1,000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA USA), phosphor-p65 (1:1,000, Cell
Signaling Technology), and GAPDH (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were diluted in
TBS-T and incubated with blots overnight at 4℃, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson immunoresearch, West Grove, PA,
USA) for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Merck
Millipore).
Cells and viruses
The African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line (Vero) was used as an appropriate cell line for SARSCoV-2 propagation. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Gibco)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). Cultured Vero cells were incubated at 37℃/5% CO2
in a humidified chamber. The antiviral activity assay was carried out using the NMC-nCoV02 strain of SARSCoV-2. The virus was propagated in Vero cells and the titer of propagated viral stock was expressed as the
tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50). All experiments using the virus were performed in a Biosafety level-3
(BLS-3) laboratory located in College of Medicine and Medical Research Institute, Chungbuk National
University, Cheongju 28644, Republic of Korea. Cell lines and virus were provided by Chungbuk University.

Cytotoxicity assay
Cytotoxicity values of the EVs on Vero Cells were determined using the Methyl Thiazolyl Tetrazolium (MTT)
assay. Briefly, 1 × 104 of Vero cells in 96-well cell culture plates were treated with different concentrations (2fold serial dilutions) of each EV in triplicate. Treated cells were incubated for 24 h at 37℃, followed by
addition of 5 mg/mL of MTT solution per well. The microplate was incubated at 37℃ for 4 h. Then, 100 μL of
DMSO solution was added to each well. Cell viability was calculated after measuring the absorbance (at 500600 nm) in a micro plate reader.
TCID50 assay
The 1 × 104 of Vero cells were seeded into 96-well plate and incubated overnight in 37℃/5% CO2 humidified
incubator. Then, the SARS-CoV-2 were serially diluted 10-fold and 0.1 ml of each dilution was added to
triplicate wells of 96-well plates containing confluent Vero cells (final volume 0.2 mL/well). After 3 days, cells
were washed by PBS and fixed by 10% formaldehyde solution for 5 minutes and stained by 1% crystal violet.
The wells were inspected for the presence of virus, as judged by the appearance of CPE (Cytopathic Effect).
The virus endpoint titration (dilution required to infect 50% of the wells) was expressed as TCID50/mL. CPE (%)
was calculated, along with the virus titer (number of positive wells/total number of wells × 100).
Antiviral activity assay
The cytotoxicity inhibition assay was used to the antiviral activity of each EVs. Briefly, Vero cells were grown
in a 96-well plate (1 × 104 cells/well) at 37℃/5% CO2 until 80% confluent. Subsequently, the culture medium
was removed from each well and 10 1–102 TCID50 of COVID virus (50 μL of suspension) and different
concentrations (2-fold serial dilutions) of EVs (50 μL) were added to each well. For the virus control, 101–103
TCID50 of virus plus the highest concentration of DMSO were added to six wells. Also, six wells were treated
with DMSO alone (negative control). The plates were incubated at 37℃/5% CO2 and CPE monitored for up to
3 days post-infection.
Cell culture

The Human Lung fibroblast cell line LL24, Human Bronchial epithelial cell line Beas-2B, Mouse microglial
cell line BV2 were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). LL24 cells were grown at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, Gibco). Passage was performed every 3 days. Beas-2B cells were cultured at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% in serum-free 1× defined keratinocyte SFM Gibco) supplemented with 5
µg/mL gentamicin (Gibco). The medium was replaced every 2–3 days and cells were passaged every 4–5 days.
BV2 were cultured at 37°C/5% CO2 in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle’s medium (D-MEM,
Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S. BV2 were passaged every 2-3 days. NSCs were isolated
from human fetal tissue at GW 10, 12, and 14 with the mother’s consent [46]. Neurons were cultured at 37°C, 5%
CO2, and 3% O2 in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) with B27 supplement (Gibco), 50 µg/mL gentamicin (Gibco), human
bFGF, human EGF 20 ng/mL (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), tocopherol, and tocopherol acetate (1 µg/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich).

PKH26 labeling of EVs

EVs were labeled with the PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit for General Cell Membranes (SigmaAldrich). Briefly, EV pellets were resuspended at 200 µg/mL in diluent C and then mixed 1:1 with dye solution
(2 µL PKH26 ethanolic dye and 500 µL diluent C) for 5 min. Next, an equal volume of 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA, Merk Millipore) was added to bind excess dye and the resultant solution was passed through 7
K MWCO Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove excess dye. Samples were stored
at -80℃.
LPS and EV treatment

For experiments, cells were seeded at equal densities into wells of 6-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark).
The cells were pre-treated with EVs for 24 h and then stimulated with LPS (LL24: 2 μg/mL, Beas-2B: 4 μg/mL,
BV2 and NSCs : 1 μg/mL) for either 6 h or 1h.
Immunocytochemistry (ICC)
Beas-2B cells were cultured and fixed in 4 % PFA for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS and
blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for an additional 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with
anti-NF-κB p65 subunit (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 24 h at 4°C. Following washing with PBS three
times to remove excess primary antibody, the cells were further incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2,000; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and stained with Gold
Antifade reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific.) for 5 min prior to the position and
quantification of ProLong nuclei. Subsequently, the slides were coverslipped and visualized using fluorescence
microscope (Nikon, Minato City, Tokyo, Japan).
RNA extraction and quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA for qPCR was extracted from LL24, Beas-2B, BV2 and NSCs. mRNA was extracted from EVs
using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Next, cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a cDNA kit
(Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). Primers for genes related to inflammation were designed for PCR and qPCR.
Reaction mixtures (20 μL total volume) contained 0.5 μM primer mixture, SYBR-Green with low ROX
(BioFact, Daejeon, Korea), nuclease-free water (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and 2 μL of cDNA. Conditions
were as follows: denaturation/activation for 10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at
56°C, and 20 sec at 72°C. Reactions were performed on a StepOne Real-Time PCR instrument (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Quantification of gene expression was based on the CT value for each
sample.
ACE2 expression
Data regarding expression of ACE2 by human tissues and cell lines were obtained from The Human Protein
Atlas database [47].
Transfection and reporter assay
A 208-bp fragment of the 3' UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was synthesized by Bionics. The 3' UTR
fragment was digested with Xba I and inserted downstream of the firefly luciferase gene in pGL3-control

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), yielding pGL3covi-3UTR_Luc. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. All
culture media contained 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. For transfection, cells were plated
at 1.2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates in antibiotic-free DMEM 1 day prior to transfection. Transfections were
carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA was 0.5 µg per well, comprising
0.2 µg of pGL3covi-3UTR_Luc and 0.3 µg of pRSV βgal as an internal control. Each transfection also
contained the indicated miRNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells from each well were lysed with 100
µL of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-phosphate [pH 7.8], 2 mM DTT, 2 mM CDTA [1,2-diaminocyclohexaneN,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid], 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). An equal volume of firefly luciferase
substrate was added, and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer plate reader and normalized against
beta-galactosidase activity.
miRNA transfection
For miRNA transfection, 6 × 104–2 × 105 cells per well were seeded into a 24-well plate and transfected with 20
nM miRNA (hsa-miR-92a-3p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-103-3p, or hsa-miR-181-5p)
(Bioneer) or with a Pre-miR miRNA Negative Control (Bioneer) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen).
RNA sequencing and data processing
Small RNA sequencing was performed using extracellular vesicles obtained under eight different conditions in
pMSC media and two placenta tissue extracts. Sequencing was performed at the Beijing Genomics Institution
(BGI, Shenzhen, China) using BGISeq-500. Reads were aligned to a human reference genome (GRCh38) using
subread aligner [48] and the featureCounts tool was used to obtain miRNA read counts [49]. miRNA read
counts were normalized, and miRNA expressed at low levels was filtered using the edgeR R package.
Expression of each miRNA was transformed to CPM. Read quality control was performed using qrqc in R
package and the distribution of small RNAs was calculated using sRNAtoolbox [50].
miRNA target prediction and functional analysis
The PITA tool [51] was used to investigate miRNA binding sites in the 3' UTR. The SARS-CoV-2 complete
genome sequence (NC_045512.2) was obtained from the NCBI reference sequence database [52] and the 3'
UTR sequence was extracted from the SARS-CoV-2 complete genome. The PITA tool was used to predict
binding sites for miRNAs. The default values were used for PITA analysis. Unconventional miRNA binding
sites were predicted by the miRDB custom prediction tool [53]. To determine the biological function of
miRNAs, experimentally validated targets were obtained from the miRTarBase [54]. miRNAs that made up a
small percentage of the total reads (<1%) were excluded from the analysis. To investigate the biological
function of miRNAs, GO term and KEGG pathway analysis were performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics
Resource 6.8 [55]. The results of functional analyses were visualized using the Cytoscape 3.8 and Pathview R
packages [56].
Analysis of conserved miRNA binding sites
To investigate conserved regions within miRNA binding sites in SARS-CoV-2, the 3' UTR sequence were
obtained from the NCBI reference sequence database. The virus 3' UTR sequence from the following
coronaviruses were used: SARS coronavirus (NC_004718.3), SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2), SARS coronavirus

BJ01 (AY278488.2), Bat SARS coronavirus HKU3-1 (DQ022305.2), Bat SARS-like coronavirus SL-CoVZC45
(MG772933.1) ,Bat SARS-like coronavirus SL- CoVZXC21 (MG772934.1) and six complete genome of
SARS-CoV-2 from Korean patients (MT730002, MT678839, MT304474, MT304475, MT304476 and
MT039890). The 3' UTR sequence of the coronaviruses were aligned using the MUSCLE tool [27]. The default
value was used for MUSCLE analysis.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using either ANOVA, followed by Tukey's HSD post-hoc test, or generalized
linear model followed by a least square mean post-hoc (R basic functions and lsmeans package). For the qPCR
results, all statistics were based on 2^(-delta Ct) values. A graph of qPCR results for inflammatory associated
genes shows fold change values. A heatmap of the log2-CPM of miRNAs in pMSC-EVs was produced using

Fig. 1. Mechanism underlying the antiviral effects of MSC-EV-derived miRNAs against SARS-CoV-2. Our
hypothesis of antiviral effects of miRNAs in EVs and EVs against SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 viruses invade cells
through ACE2 receptors and EVs enter cells through various pathways, including membrane fusion, receptormediated uptake, and active endocytosis. The cell secretes cytokines, induces an immune fraction, and stimulates
immune cells to fight the viral infection. Too much cytokine leads to a cytokine storm (left panel). The direct effects
of EV miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2 virus regulation are mediated by targeting regions within the SARS-CoV-2
genome, including the 3' UTR, the 5' UTR, and coding sequences. In particular, direct binding to the 3’ UTR is
predicted to down-regulate SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In addition, EVs regenerate damaged tissue and regulate the
proinflammatory environment via their miRNAs and protein cargoes, indicating their potential to suppress cytokine
storms caused by viral infection (right panel).

Figure S5: Significant inflammatory KEGG pathways regulating by the targets of the five miRNAs (A) Statistical enrichment analysis of GO terms for 83
inflammatory associated genes. The plot shows the top 30 GO terms. The x axis shows minus log10 transformed and adjusted p-values and the y axis shows the
GO terms. (B) Significant pathways involving the 83 genes targeted by the five miRNAs. The 83 genes are predicted to be involved in inflammatory responses
through pathways such as TNF signaling (C), Toll-like receptor signaling (D), cytokine-cytokine interactions (E), NF-kappa B signaling (F), and chemokine
signaling (G). The red box in each pathway indicates the gene targeted directly by the miRNAs.
