Abstract
We tested 10 recombinant antibodies directed against the
spike S protein from SARS-CoV-1. Among them,
antibodies AI334 and AQ806 detect by ELISA the spike S
protein from SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The spike (S) glycoprotein (UniProt #P0DTC2) mediates
attachment of coronaviruses to the host ACE2 receptor
(through the Receptor-Binding Domain [RBD] in the S1
subunit) and fusion with the host cell membrane (through
the S2 subunit) (Yan et al., 2020). Here we describe the
ability of two recombinant antibodies (AI334 and AQ806)
to detect by ELISA the soluble ectodomain of the S protein
from SARS-CoV-2.

Materials & Methods
Antibodies:
ABCD_AA831,
ABCD_AF167,
ABCD_AF618,
ABCD_AH286,
ABCD_AH287,
ABCD_AH971,
ABCD_AH974,
ABCD_AI334,
ABCD_AQ601, ABCD_AQ602, and ABCD_AQ806
antibodies (ABCD nomenclature, https://web.expasy.org/
abcd/) were produced by the Geneva Antibody Facility
(http://www.unige.ch/medecine/antibodies/) as miniantibodies with the antigen-binding scFv portion fused to
a mouse IgG2A Fc. The synthesized scFv sequences
(GeneArt, Invitrogen) correspond to the sequences of the
variable regions joined by a peptide linker (GGGGS)3 (see
Table 1 for clone names and references). HEK293
suspension cells (growing in FreeStyle™ 293 Expression
Medium, Gibco #12338) were transiently transfected with
the vector coding for the scFv-Fc of each antibody.
Supernatants (see Table 1 for individual yields) were
collected after 5 days.

Antigen: The prefusion ectodomain (residues 1-1208) of
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, with a KV->PP substitution at
residues 986/987, a RRAR->GSAS substitution at
residues 682-685, and C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization
motif, protease cleavage site, TwinStrepTag and 8xHisTag
(PDB #6VSB; Wrapp et al., 2020b), was transiently
transfected into 25x108 suspension-adapted ExpiCHO
cells (Thermo Fisher) using 1.5 mg plasmid DNA and 7.5
mg of PEI MAX (Polysciences) in 500 mL ProCHO5
medium (Lonza). Incubation with agitation was continued
at 31°C and 4.5% CO2 for 5 days. The clarified supernatant
was purified in two steps: via a Strep-Tactin XT column
(IBA Lifesciences) followed by Superose 6 10/300 GL
column (GE Healthcare) to a final concentration of 180
µg/ml in PBS.
Protocol: S protein (10 µg/ml, 50 µl/well in PBS 0.5%
(w/v) BSA, 0.1% (w/v) Tween20) was immobilized on
streptavidin-coated ELISA plates (Pierce #15124) for 30
min. Each well was rinsed three times with 100 µl of
washing buffer (PBS + 0.5% (w/v) BSA + 0.05% (w/v)
Tween20), then incubated for 1 hour with 50 µl of each
antibody-containing supernatant diluted in washing buffer
(Fig. 1). After rinsing 3 times (100 µl washing buffer),
wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled
goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad #170-6516, dilution
1:1000, 50 µl per well) for 30 min. After 3 rinses,
Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma #T5569)
was added (50 µl per well). The reaction was stopped by
the addition of 25 µl of 2 M H2SO4. The absorbance (OD)
was measured at 450 nm, and the absorbance at 570 nm
was subtracted.

Results
We tested 10 antibodies, originally developed against the
SARS-CoV-1 S protein, for detection of the SARS-CoV2 S protein by ELISA. From these, only two (AI334 and
AQ806) bound in a concentration-dependent manner to
the SARS-CoV-2 protein (Fig. 1). Two other antibodies,
used as negative control (AH917 against the SARS-CoV1 N protein and RB168 against an amoeba protein), also
did not bind the S protein. AI334 and AQ806 antibodies
have recently been shown to bind the RBD of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein (Yuan et al., 2020; Wrapp et al.,
2020a).
