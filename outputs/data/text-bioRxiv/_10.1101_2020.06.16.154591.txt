ABSTACT
The mutation pattern of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is constantly changing with the places of transmission, but the reason
remains to be revealed. Here, we presented the study that comprehensively analyzed
the potential selective pressure of immune system restriction, which can drive
mutations in circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates. The results showed that the most
common mutation sites of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were located on the non-structural
protein ORF1ab and the structural protein Spike. Further analysis revealed mutations
in cross-reactive epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronavirus may help
SARS-CoV-2 to escape cellular immunity under the long-term and large-scale
community transmission. Meanwhile, the mutations on Spike protein may enhance the
ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells and escape the recognition of B-cell
immunity. This study will increase the understanding of the evolutionary direction and
warn about the potential immune escape ability of SARS-CoV-2, which may provide
important guidance for the potential vaccine design.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic caused by a novel Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was stated in late December
2019 and now become worldwide pandemic1,2. The whole-genome sequence of
SARS-CoV-2 was first released on Jan 20203,4 and followed by massive strain isolates
derived from human patients shared in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influence Data
(GISAID) 5. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are naturally host in vertebrate including birds,
swine, cat, multiple bats and human6. Based on our best knowledge, there are 7
human-susceptible CoVs and among them, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63
and HCoV-OC43 could only cause slight respiratory infections7. On the contrary,
other three CoVs including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could cause
serious clinical symptoms of fever, cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia, further, may

results in progressive respiratory failure and even death 3,8. Previous research
indicated that SARS-CoV-2 share only 50% identity with the MERS-CoV and 79%
identity with the SARS-CoV 1,9, but share over 90% similarity with a bat
SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV, RaTG13) collected in Yunnan, China 3,10.
The rapid accumulation of the whole-genome sequence 1,5 illustrated that the
mutations are already observed in both structure and non-structure proteins including
ORF1ab, envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N), Spike (S), ORF3a, ORF6,
ORF7a, and ORF7b on SARS-CoV-2. Even though the isolates share with over 99%
identity 2, the mutations could lead to not only the occurrence of different subtypes 2,
but also impact the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 11. However, the driver of the
mutations is still un-revealed and comprehensive investigation is needed to reveal the
evolutionary pressure and virulent of the future types of SARS-CoV-2.
The evolution of viruses was mainly affected by the population-level of epidemics,
which could allow the opportunities for viruses under evolutionary selective pressure
by the immune system of its host 12. For example, the new antigenic variants could be
observed in every 3 to 5 years for influenza A/H3N2 viruses under the selective
pressure of the antibody mediated humoral immunity 12. On the other hand, as an
essential part of human immune system, cellular immunity could response to the viral
infectious through T-cell and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) 13. Unlike humoral
immunity which is majorly targeting the main antigen protein the viruses, the HLA
could recognize the T-cell epitope of the whole genome including structure and
non-structure proteins. Moreover, HLA could present the T-cell epitope to the surface
of the antigen presenting cell (APC), and further, binding with the T-cell receptors
(TCRs) to trigger the immune response 13. The long-term symbiosis of virus and its
host will lead to HLA mediated cellular immunity and accelerate the evolution of
virus in multiple cases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis D
virus (HDV) 14,15. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new emerging pathogen, seasonal
HCoVs had been circulating in community for a long time. Currently, multiple works
suggesting the existence of cross-reactive T-cell recognitions between circulating
seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-216-18. Thus, the long-term community transmission
of seasonal HCoVs may also drove the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under the
selective pressure of the immune system. In this work, a comprehensive analysis of
the SARS-CoV-2 mutants and the potential binding affinity of T-cell epitopes were
provided based on current released mutation strains. Especially for the mutations on
ORF1ab which could alter the binding affinity of cross-reactive peptides between
seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2, and the mutations on S protein which could
enhance the binding affinity of ACE2 and decrease the binding affinity of antibody.
The study presented in this work could not only provides a new insight into the
factors driving the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and its evolutionary pattern, but also
provide theoretical guidance for the vaccine and therapeutic antibody design.

Workflow of mutation pattern analysis for SARS-CoV-2.
Till now, the worldwide community spreading of SARS-CoV-2 could lead to the
monitoring and responding of human immune system including HLA mediated
cellular immunity and B-cell receptor (BCR) mediated humoral immunity.
Consistently, to escape the acquired immune system, the virus will be mutated under
the selective pressure. For cellular immunity, both HLA-I and HLA-II molecules
presenting multiple alleles in different ethnicities. The diversity of alleles will lead to
the presentation of different peptides. Thus, the HLA mediated selective pressure is
closely related to the spreading among various human races. By taking benefit from
the worldwide spreading of SARS-CoV-2, it is a great opportunity for us to reveal the
immune system mediated selective pressure and the potential evolutionary direction
of SARS-CoV-2.
Here, we provided a comprehensive analysis in four levels including: 1) mapping
the mutations on the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and deriving all
potential T-cell epitopes (PTEs) involving mutation sites (Figure 1a), 2) analyzing the
potential peptides based on the circulating regions of viruses worldwide and the local
dominant alleles (Figure 1b), 3) revealing the selective pressure of HLA through
cross-reactive peptides (CRPs) between seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure
1c), and 4) evaluating the binding affinity of S protein mutants against human ACE2
and binding antibody (Figure 1d). Results indicated that: 1) the mutations were
occurred in the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 including all structure and
non-structure proteins, the most frequent mutation sites are in the structure protein of
Spike (S) and the non-structure protein of ORF1ab, 2) the frequent mutation sites and
strains were discovered in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom,
which have suffered from long-term and large-scale community transmissions, 3) the
CRPs between seasonal HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 on ORF1ab trend to mutate
towards the direction of escape from immune response by reducing the binding
affinity against both HLA-I and HLA-II, and 4) the mutations of Spike protein could
enhance the ability to enter the host cells by increase the binding affinity of ACE2,
moreover, escape the surveillance of humoral immunity by decrease the binding
affinity of binding antibody.

Frequent mutations on ORF1ab and S protein of SARS-CoV-2
Till May, 20th, 2020, we observed 4,420 mutation sites on 10 structure and
non-structure proteins including ORF1ab, Spike (S), ORF3a, Envelope (E),
Membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8, Nucleocapsid (N) and ORF10 (Figure 2a).
The conserved regions of all above proteins could be determined by the Identify
Conserved Domains (ICD) tools in NCBI 19. Results showed that ORF1ab, S, ORF3a,
M, ORF7a, ORF8 and N contain both conserved and non-conserved area. Among
them, ORF1ab and S protein contains the most frequent mutation sites with mutation
frequency over 0.6 (Figure 2a), which indicating the potential immune pressure
mediated evolution. The mutation frequency and counts of each residues could be
found in Supplementary Table 1. It can be noted that ORF1ab is the largest
non-structural polyprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which could trigger the cellular immunity
by divided peptides presented by HLA molecules. S protein is the major protein target
in humoral immunity, which is mutated under the pressure of BCR or antibodies.
Further, we counted the continent-specific mutation sites and found the most
frequent mutations occurred on S protein, ORF1ab, N protein and ORF3a with 9 sites
mutated over 200 times, 5 sites mutated over 800 times and 2 sites mutated over 9,000
times. Among top 5 mutations, D614G on S protein is counted for 9,780 times,
followed by P4715L on ORF1ab (9,745 times), R203K on N protein (2,866 times),
P5828L on ORF1ab (1,021 times) and G251V on ORF3a (859 times). Detailed
information of all mutation sites can be found in Supplementary Table 2. More
interestingly, the most frequently mutated sites were detected from strains circulating
in Northern America and the Europe, which are two major epidemic regions with
long-time and large-population transmission of SARS-CoV-2. For example, D614G
mutations on S protein were counted for 2,950 times and 3,071 times in the United
States and the United Kingdom, respectively. As well as the P4715L mutations on
ORF1ab, which were counted for 2,958 and 3,070 times in the United States and the
United Kingdom, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). The frequent mutations on
S protein and ORF1ab might be caused by the selective pressure of humoral immunity
and cellular immunity after the long-term, large-scale community transmission of
COVID-19.

Mutations shifting the immunogenicity of T-cell peptides.
With the worldwide spreading of COVID-19 epidemic, the infectious time and
infected nations or regions are expended. Here, all 8-mer to 15-mer peptides with
mutation sites were derived from circulating isolates (see Methods). For each strain
with collected locations, the HLA alleles with the dominant population coverage
(allele frequency  0.05) were selected and the binding affinity of its corresponding
HLA-I/HLA-II alleles were predicted by IEDB standalone MHC-I/MHC-II binding
prediction tools 20, 21 (see Methods). Reference peptides on sequence of SARS-CoV-2
strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (MN908947.3) was used for comparison (see Methods).
Results illustrated that most of the mutations on potential T-cell epitopes (PTEs)
didn’t shift the predicted binding affinity (Supplementary Table 4 &
Supplementary Table 5). For mutations which alter the binding affinity, weak to
strong peptides (WSPs) are significantly higher than strong to weak peptides (SWPs).
As been illustrated in Figure 2a, the number of WSPs are higher than SWPs for both

HLA-I and HLA-II PTEs on most of the non-structure and structure proteins contains.
On the contrary, for S protein, the number of SWPs are 2.2 times and 1.8 times higher
than WSPs for both HLA-I and HLA-II PTEs, respectively.
HLA mediated immune pressure could promote the evolution of cross-reactive
epitopes between seasonal CoVs and SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, we derived the cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) between seasonal human
coronavirus (HCoVs) and SARS-CoV-2 for further analysis (see Methods). The
infection of seasonal HCoVs are ubiquitous and could cause slight symptoms such as
common cold7,22,23. Epidemiological data indicating an average of two episodes of
“common cold” per year in the adult population, which extrapolated that HCoVs
could infected adults in every two to three years 24. The consistent transmission of
HCoVs in human population could maintain the immune memory and produce
selective pressure for the CREs between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we detected
the CREs between HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2, which might already be circulated
across the community before the epidemic of COVID-19. By matching the
information of original infectious regions with the dominant HLA-I/HLA-II alleles,
197/358 alleles and 9327/943 peptides which covering 13/11 nations in 7/4 continents
were derived for further analysis. For each CREs, the binding affinity of
HLA-I/HLA-II with the corresponding alleles were predicted by IEBD
MHC-I/MHC-II binding prediction tools (see Methods).
It can be found that, the number of WSPs is 1.6 times than SWPs on ORF1ab for
all peptides involving mutations (Supplementary Table 6). However, the number of
CREs illustrated opposite results, in which cross-reactive SWPs are significantly
higher than those of WSPs on all 6 continents including North America, Europe,
South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania (Figure 2c). For example, the
results in North America showed that cross-reactive HLA-I SWPs (34,800) are 20.1
times than WSPs (1,733). Similar results could also be found for Europe, South Asia,
East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, in which the number of cross-reactive HLA-I
SWPs are 1.75 to 4 times than those WSPs. The SWPs with counting number of 10
can be found in Supplementary Table 7.
For HLA-II, CREs could only be detected in North American, Europe, East Asia,
and South Asia, which illustrated the same phenomenon. Here, 2,206 cross-reactive
HLA-II SWPs were detected, 4 times than those WSPs (546). For North America,
Europe, and East Asia, the number of cross-reactive HLA-II SWPs are 2.4 times to
19.4 times than those WSPs. On the contrary, we detected 13 cross-reactive HLA-II
WSPs in the data of South Asia, which is higher than the number of SWPs as 2. This
might be due to the fact the small amount of sequence submitted from South Asia in
current time.
Mutations on S protein increase binding capacity of ACE2 and decrease affinity
of antibody.
The S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the major target for the humoral immunity and
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein could mediate the attachment of

viruses to the surface receptors in host cell 25-27. Thus, under the selective pressure of
both sides, the S protein was mutated frequently. Here, we evaluate the mutations on
S protein, specifically on the ACE2 binding domain and the epitopes for antibody. The
3-D structures of three mutants with mutation in ACE2 binding domain including
R408I, N439K, G476S (Figure XX) and four mutants with mutation in epitope
regions including K378R, H519P, H519Q, R408I (Figure 2d) were constructed by
homology modeling 28. Further, the binding affinities between corresponding mutants
and ACE2 29 or antibody CR3022 30 were calculated through molecular docking31.
The RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1(MN908947.3) was selected as
reference for control.
As been illustrated in Figure 2d, the mutants of R408I, N439K and G476S could
promote the binding capacity between RBD region and ACE2 compared with
reference. Among them, arginine (R) and lysine (K) are alkaline amino acids, the
mutations of R to isoleucine (I) and asparagine (N) to K involving significant property
changes. Further investigation illustrated the potential binding site for N439K is the
acidic amino acids glutamicacid in 329E, which could form an ionic bond to increase
the binding capacity between RBD and ACE2 (Figure 2d). Moreover, the potential
binding site for R408I is the alkaline amino acid of histidine (H), the mutations of
R408I might reduce the repulsive force between two alkaline amino acids of H and R
(Figure 2d).
On the contrary, the mutations of K378R, H519P, H519Q, R408I could decrease the
binding capacity of antibody CR3022. Among them, only K378R didn’t involving
huge property changes since K and R are both alkaline amino acids. Other three are
both alkaline amino acids mutated to uncharged residues. It could be observed that
408R could form an ionic bond with the asparticacid (D) in 54D on the H chain. After
R mutated to I, the ionic bond will be broken to reduce the binding capacity of the
antibody. Above results indicated that the mutations on the RBD of S protein might
enhance the ability of virus to target the ACE2 receptor and further promote the
capacity of virus to invade host cell. Moreover, the mutations on RBD hold the
potential to decrease the binding ability of antibodies and lead to immune escape of
the virus.

Discussion
At present, the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 immeasurably impact the human
health and economic development worldwide. Thus, revealing the evolutionary
pattern would be extremely helpful for the disease prevention and vaccine design. In
this article, we comprehensively analysis the mutation pattern based on the largest
available dataset of mutations to reveal the evolution direction and potential drivers of
SARS-CoV-2. Results showed that the mutations could cause more WSPs than SWPs
on the whole genome. However, for cross-reactive peptide between seasonal HCoVs
and SARS-CoV-2, the number of SWPs are significantly higher than WSPs on
ORF1ab, indicating the potential natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 by pre-existing
cross-reactive T cell immunity. Further, the analysis on S protein illustrated that the

evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to be more infective by increase the
binding affinity of ACE2 and escape the surveillance of the immune system by reduce
the binding affinity of the corresponding antibody.
Since Dec, 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 has spread to over 200 countries or regions in
six months, and maintained the continuous transmission so far. The long terms
community transmission in different regions and races will make SARS-CoV-2 under
different the types of immune pressure. As a typical RNA virus, those selective
pressure will drove the frequent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, moreover, according to
our results, this evolution may have certain directionality towards immune escape.
Currently, nations such as United States, United Kingdom, and China are suffering
from the epidemic and are the high incidence areas of SARS-CoV-2. It can be
observed that the long-term and large-scale community transmission in these
countries makes the existential time of weak binding peptides longer than strong
binding peptides. It is suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 in those countries may have
the evolutionary direction of reducing the immunogenicity of T-cell epitopes.
Furthermore, we systematically analyzed the mutation of CREs between
SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoVs. The results showed that although the number of
SWPs and WSPs in the mutations of whole genome peptides are not significantly
different from each other, however, SWPs in the mutations of CREs had an
overwhelming number over WSPs in tens or even hundreds of times. Since adults will
be infected with seasonal HCoVs every two to three years 7, seasonal HCoVs have
already been spread with in large-scale of population in a long-term. Therefore, the
mutations of CREs in SARS-CoV-2 will evolved towards the direction of immune
escape.
Finally, we analyzed the target protein Spike of the B-cell immunity and found that
the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 can not only enhance the binding affinity with human
receptor ACE2 by form a new ionic bond through mutation such as N439K, but also
reduce the binding affinity of antibody CR3022 by destroying the ionic bond through
mutation R408I. This result suggests that S protein has an evolutionary trend to
increase infectious ability and escape immune monitoring under B-cell immune
pressure.
According to a latest research of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics 18,
SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread much longer than we expected. This research
points out that if the immune response for SARS-CoV-2 infections are long-term or
even life-time effective, the epidemic may end in year 2021. However, if the immune
memory is short-term effective, such as 40 weeks to 104 weeks, the risk of annual or
periodic eruption in every two or three years is existed, like the seasonal HCoVs.
Consistently, our research indicated that rapid mutations of SARS-CoV-2 may trend
to escape from the monitoring and recognition of the immune system. This means that
even if the effective vaccine could be developed for current circulating SARS-CoV-2,
the rapid, immune escape trend mutations will cause the ineffective of vaccine in a
short time. Thus, we may expect the vaccine development become a cyclical work for
SARS-CoV-2 in the future, just like the case of influenza virus. In this circumstance,
monitoring the mutations and antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 timely will be a

very important task.

METHODS
Data source
The reference amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (MN908947.3) and four human
susceptible seasonal CoVs including HCoV-229E (NC_002645.1), HCoV-HKU1
(NC_006577.2), HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831.2), and HCoV-OC43 (NC_006213.1)
were derived from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 32.
The mutant information (GFF3 files) of 10 structure and non-structure proteins
including spike protein, envelope protein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein,
orf1ab protein, ORF3a, OFR6, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10 were derived from the
National Genomics Data Center 33 till May, 20th, 2020. For mutation analysis of the
whole protein sequence, we extended the indel positions to the reference sequence to
obtain a more precise mutation frequency for each amino acid point. For ease of
k-mer analysis, all non-mismatch mutations are excluded, which left 4,420 mutation
sites for downstream analysis.
Frequency of alleles in different countries and regions were obtained from Allele
Frequency Net Database (AFND) 34. For each country and region, only those alleles
with frequency over 0.05 and population over 25 were retained.
Peptide preparation
Mutant peptide preparation. For each mutation site  compared with reference
sequence Wuhan-Hu-1(MN908947.3), the sequence from site   15 to   15 was
derived from the corresponding protein sequence of the mutants. Further, it will be
divided into peptides with the sliding windows of 8-mer to 15-mer and searching step
of 1-mer. Among all peptides, those contain the mutation site  was retained as the
mutant epitopes.
Cross-reactive epitope preparation. Each of the mutant peptide of SARS-CoV-2
was compared against all four seasonal CoVs using in-house python script. The
cross-reactive epitopes were defined as those peptides that are identical to the k-mer
sequence in at least one of the seasonal CoVs.
Prediction of HLA binding affinity
Both the HLA-I and HLA-II binding affinities between HLA alleles and k-mer
peptides were predicted by the T Cell Epitope Prediction Tools (standalone version
2.22.3) with IEDB (Immune Epitope Database) recommended methods 21, 20. For HLA
I alleles, 8-14 mer peptides were analyzed and were considered strong binding
peptides with a cutoff ≤ 0.01 35. For HLA II alleles, only 15 mer peptides were
analyzed and a consensus percentile rank of the top 10% was considered strong
binding peptide36. The allele-peptide pairs with prediction score lager than the cutoff
was considered weak binding peptides. The total number of strong or weak binders
were determined by the combination of strains and alleles.
