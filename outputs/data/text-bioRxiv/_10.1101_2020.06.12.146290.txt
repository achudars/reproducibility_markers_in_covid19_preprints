SUMMARY

39

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has unprecedented implications for public health, social

40

life, and world economy. Since approved drugs and vaccines are not available, new

41

options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are highly demanded. To identify

42

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, we analysed the antibody response of 12

43

COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days post diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-

44

CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early

45

as 8 days post diagnosis. Among these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-

46

CoV-2 (IC100 as low as 0.04 µg/ml), showing a broad spectrum of V genes and low

47

levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursors were identified in

48

naïve B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals that were sampled before the

49

COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

50

antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering the hope

51

of rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination.

INTRODUCTION

58

By mid-May 2020 over 4.5 million severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

59

(SARS-CoV-2) infections and over 300,000 casualties of the associated coronavirus

60

disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported (Dong et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Zhou

61

et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). The exponential spread of the virus has caused

62

countries to shut down public life with unprecedented social and economic

63

consequences. Therefore, decoding SARS-CoV-2 immunity to promote the

64

development of vaccines as well as potent antiviral drugs is an urgent health need

65

(Sanders et al., 2020).

66

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been demonstrated to effectively target

67

and neutralize viruses such as Ebola virus (EBOV; Ehrhardt et al., 2019; Flyak et al.,

68

2016; Saphire et al., 2018), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; Kwakkenbos et al.,

69

2010), influenza virus (Corti et al., 2011; Joyce et al., 2016; Kallewaard et al., 2016),

70

or human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1; Burton et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2016a,

71

2016b; Scheid et al., 2011; Schommers et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2010). The most

72

prominent target for an antibody-mediated response on the surface of SARS-CoV-2

73

virions is the homotrimeric spike (S) protein. The S protein promotes cell entry

74

through the interaction of a receptor-binding domain (RBD) with angiotensin-

75

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Antibodies

76

that target the S protein are therefore of high value to prevent and treat COVID-19

77

(Burton and Walker, 2020).

RESULTS

80

SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals develop a polyclonal memory B cell response

81

against the S protein

82

To investigate the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, we collected blood

83

samples from seven COVID-19 patients (aged 38 to 59 years) between 8 and 36

84

days post diagnosis (Figure 1A, Table S1). Five patients presented with mild

85

symptoms including dry cough, fever, and dyspnoea, while two patients were

86

asymptomatic (Table S1). Purified plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) of all seven

87

individuals showed binding to the full trimeric S-ectodomain (Wrapp et al., 2020), with

88

half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) ranging from 3.1 to 96.1 µg/ml (Figure

89

1B, Table S2). Moreover, neutralizing IgG activity was determined against authentic

90

SARS-CoV-2, showing 100% inhibitory concentrations (IC100) between 78.8 and

91

1,500 µg/ml in five out of seven patients (Figure 1B, Table S2). In order to decipher

92

the SARS-CoV-2 B cell and antibody response on a molecular level, we performed

93

single B cell sorting and sequence analysis of all individuals. Using flow cytometry,

94

we detected between 0.04% (± 0.06) and 1.02% (± 0.11) IgG+ B cells that reacted

95

with the S-ectodomain (Figure 1C, Figure S1). From these we isolated a total of

96

1,751 single B cells and amplified IgG heavy and light chains using optimized PCR

97

protocols (Figure 1C, Table S3; Kreer et al., 2020a; Schommers et al., 2020).

98

Sequence analysis revealed a polyclonal antibody response with 22% to 45%

99

clonally related sequences per individual and 2 to 29 members per identified B cell

100

clone (Figure 1D, Table S3). We conclude that a polyclonal B cell response against

101

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was initiated in all studied COVID-19 patients.

105

Longitudinal analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response

106

To delineate the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, we obtained

107

longitudinal blood samples from an additional five infected individuals at three time

108

points spanning 8 to 69 days post diagnosis (Figure 2A, Table S1). Across the

109

different

110

neutralization) values of plasma IgG ranged from 1.54 to 129 µg/ml and 78.8 to 1,500

111

µg/ml, respectively (Figure 2B, Table S2). For each individual, however, this

112

response remained almost unchanged over the studied period (Figure 2A, B).

(S-ectodomain

and

IC100

(SARS-CoV-2

113

To investigate B cell clonality and antibody characteristics on a single cell level,

114

we proceeded to sort S-ectodomain-reactive IgG+ B cells from all five subjects at the

115

different time points (t1, t2, t3). We found up to 0.65% SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells,

116

with a tendency towards higher frequencies at later time points (Figure 2C). From a

117

total of 2,562 B cells, we detected 254 B cell clones (Table S3). 51% of these clones

118

(129) were recurrently detected, suggesting the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive

119

B cells over the investigated period of 2.5 months. When separated by individual time

120

points, the fraction of clonally related sequences ranged from 18% to 67% across

121

patients and remained constant or showed only moderate decreases over time

122

(Figure 2D).

123

Next, we analysed the single cell Ig sequences (6,587 productive heavy and

124

light chains) from all 12 patients (Figure 2E-F, Figure S2). Here, clonally related and

125

non-clonal sequences similarly presented a broad spectrum of VH gene segments,

126

normally distributed heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3)

127

lengths, symmetrical CDRH3 hydrophobicity distributions, and a predominance of the

128

IgG1 isotype (Figure 2E). However, in comparison to repertoire data from healthy

129

individuals, IgVH 3-30 was overrepresented and clonal sequences more often

130

facilitated κ over λ light chains (3/4 in clonal versus 2/3 in non-clonal, p = 0.0027;

131

Figure 2F, Figure S2). Finally, VH genes of S-reactive B cells were on average less

132

mutated than VH genes from healthy IgG+ repertoires (median identity of 98.3 vs.

133

94.3, p < 0.0001; Figure 2E, Figure S2). We concluded that a SARS-CoV-2-reactive

134

IgG+ B cell response readily develops after infection with the same B cell clones

135

detectable over time and a preference for facilitating the VH gene segment 3-30.

136
137

Isolation of highly potent near-germline SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies

138

from COVID-19 patients

139

To determine antibody characteristics and to isolate potent neutralizing antibodies,

140

we cloned a total of 312 matched heavy and light chain pairs (70% clonal, 30% non-

141

clonal) from all 12 patients. From 255 successfully produced IgG1 antibodies, 79

142

(31%) bound to the full trimeric S-ectodomain (Wrapp et al., 2020) with EC50 values

143

ranging between 0.02 µg/ml and 5.20 µg/ml (Figure 3A). Of these, 30 antibodies

144

showed SARS-CoV-2 reactivity by a commercial diagnostic system (Euroimmun IgG

145

detection kit; Figure 3A and B, Table S4). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)

146

analyses using the RBD as analyte for 13 SARS-CoV-2 interacting antibodies gave

147

dissociation constant (KD) values as low as 0.02 nM (Table S4). By determining the

148

neutralization activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2, we found 28 neutralizing

149

antibodies in 9 out of 12 patients with IC100 values ranging between 100 µg/ml (assay

150

limit) and 0.04 µg/ml (Figure 3C and D). Of note, neutralizing activity was mainly

151

detected among high affinity antibodies (Figure 3B, Table S4) and a positive

152

correlation between neutralization and binding could be detected (rs = 0.429, p =

153

0.023; Figure 3E).

154

To better characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and

155

reactive antibodies, we determined binding to a truncated N-terminal S1 subunit

156

(including the RBD), the isolated RBD, and a monomeric S ectodomain. We found 27

157

out of 28 neutralizing antibodies binding to the RBD, but only 31% of the non-

158

neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that the RBD is a major site of vulnerability on the

159

S protein. Epitopes for non-neutralizing antibodies included the N-terminal S1 domain

160

and conformational epitopes (Figure 3F, Table S4). Notably, both neutralizing and

161

non-neutralizing antibodies were characterized by a broad distribution of VH as well

162

as VL gene segments and a preference for κ light chains (Figure 3G, Figure S4).

163

Moreover, 32 of 79 binding and 11 of 28 neutralizing antibodies demonstrated

164

germline identities of 99% to 100 % and no correlation was detected between

165

neutralizing activity and the level of somatic mutation (Figure 3G, Supplementary

166

Table. 4, Figure S3).

167

Finally, we performed a HEp-2 cell autoreactivity assay. 4 out of 28 neutralizing

168

antibodies showed low to moderate signs of autoreactivity (Figure S5, Table S4) and

169

2 of them also reacted with other proteins (i.e. Ebola glycoprotein, HIV-1 gp140;

170

Table S4). In summary, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies

171

develop from a broad set of different V genes and are characterized by a low degree

172

of somatic mutations. Moreover, we were able to isolate highly potent neutralizing

173

antibodies that present promising candidates for antibody mediated prevention and

174

therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

178

To investigate the development of somatic mutations over time, we longitudinally

179

analysed 129 recurring B cell clones that comprised 17 binding and six neutralizing

180

antibodies. To this end, we phylogenetically matched all members of a B cell clone at

181

a given time point with the most closely related member at the consecutive time point

182

(331 pairings in total). Mean mutation frequencies in either direction (i.e., towards

183

higher or lower V gene germline identities) were 0.51±0.61%, 0.08±0.51%, and

184

0.01±0.19% per week for all, binding, and neutralizing clonal members, respectively

185

(Figure 4A upper panels). When averaging VH gene germline identity of concurrent

186

clonal members, we found a moderate increase in somatic mutations over time

187

(Figure 4A lower panels). Changes were similar for binding and neutralizing

188

subsets with one exception among the neutralizing antibodies that accumulated

189

about 5% nucleotide mutations over the investigated period (Figure 4A lower

190

panel). In line with this finding, neutralizing antibodies isolated at days 8 to 17 and

191

days 34 to 42 post diagnosis showed VH gene germline identities of 97.5% and

192

97.0%, respectively (Figure 4B). We concluded that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

193

antibodies carry similar levels of somatic hypermutation independently of the time of

194

isolation.

Potential precursor sequences of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies can be

198

The low rate of somatic mutations in the majority of binding and neutralizing

199

antibodies emphasizes the requirement for the presence of distinct germline

200

recombinations in the naïve human B cell repertoire. To estimate the frequency of

201

potential precursor B cells, we performed unbiased heavy and light chain next

202

generation sequencing (NGS) of the naïve B cell receptor repertoires from 48 healthy

203

donors (Table S5). All samples were collected before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and

204

comprised a total of 1,7 million collapsed reads with 455,423 unique heavy, 170,781

205

κ, and 91,505 λ chain clonotypes (defined as identical V/J pairing and the same

206

CDR3 amino acid sequence). Within this data set we searched for heavy and light

207

chains that resemble the 79 SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies (Figure 5A). For 14 out

208

of 79 tested antibodies, we found 61 heavy chain clonotypes with identical V/J pairs

and similar (± 1 aa in length and up to 3 aa differences) CDRH3s in 28 healthy

210

individuals

211

(MnC2t1p1_C12). For light chains, we identified 1,357 κ chain precursors with exact

212

CDR3 matches that cover 41 of 62 antibodies and 109 λ chain precursors that

213

represent 7 of 17 antibodies (Figure 5B and 4C). All 48 naive repertoires included at

214

least one κ and one λ chain precursor. When combining heavy and light chain data,

215

we found both precursor sequences of 9 antibodies in 14 healthy individuals (Figure

216

5C). Importantly, among these potential precursor pairs, we found three potent

217

neutralizing antibodies (CnC2t1p1_B4, HbnC3t1p1_G4, and HbnC3t1p2_B10). While

218

the NGS repertoire data did not include pairing information of heavy and light chain

219

combinations, we found matched heavy and light chain sequences despite small

220

sample sizes of on average 9,500 heavy and 2,000 to 3,500 light chain clonotypes

221

per individual. We thus conclude that potential SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing

222

antibody precursors are likely to be abundant in naïve B cell repertoires.

DISCUSSION

225

Neutralizing antibodies can effectively target pathogens and their induction is a key

226

objective of vaccination strategies (Fauci and Marston, 2015; Mascola and

227

Montefiori, 2010; Walker and Burton, 2018; Zolla-Pazner et al., 2019). A detailed

228

understanding of the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is therefore critical

229

for the development of effective immune mediated approaches against the continuing

230

pandemic (Burton and Walker, 2020; Koff et al., 2013; Kreer et al., 2020b). Through

231

the single cell analysis of >4,000 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells from 12 infected

232

individuals, we identified highly potent human monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing

233

antibodies. These antibodies block authentic viral infection at concentrations as low

234

as 0.04 µg/ml and provide a novel option for prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-

235

2 infection. For many viral pathogens, the development of antibody potency is

236

dependent on prolonged affinity maturation (Abela et al., 2019; Andrews et al., 2019;

237

Davis et al., 2019; Wec et al., 2020). In contrast, high SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing

238

activity can be observed for antibodies that show little if any deviation from their

239

germline precursors outside of their CDR3s. Our longitudinal analysis of the B cell

240

response spanning a period of more than 2.5 months after SARS-CoV-2

241

transmission reveals that the development of a neutralizing antibody response is

242

followed by limited additional somatic mutation. Thus, vaccine efficacy may be more

243

dependent on the engagement of naïve B cells rather than an extended presence of

244

antigen to enable the accumulation of multiple antibody mutations. Importantly, we

245

observed potential heavy and light chain precursors of potent SARS-CoV-2-

246

neutralizing antibodies among the naïve B cell repertoires of healthy individuals that

247

were sampled before the pandemic. Given the broad gene distribution among SARS-

248

CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, our findings therefore indicate the potential for a

249

broadly active SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals and sample collection

390

Samples were obtained under a study protocol approved by the Institutional Review

391

Board of the University of Cologne and respective local IRBs (study protocol 16-054).

392

All participants provided written informed consent and were recruited at hospitals or

393

as outpatients. Sites of recruitment were Munich Clinic Schwabing for IDMnC1,2,4

394

and 5, the University Hospital of Frankfurt for patients IDFnC1, 2, and University

METHOD DETAILS

399

Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma and total IgG

400

from whole blood

401

Blood draw collection was performed using EDTA tubes and/or syringes pre-filled

402

with heparin. PBMC isolation was performed using Leucosep centrifuge tubes

403

(Greiner Bio-one) prefilled with density gradient separation medium (Histopaque;

404

Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma was collected

405

and stored separately. For IgG isolation, 1 ml of the collected plasma was heat-

406

inactivated (56°C for 40 min) and incubated with Protein G Sepharose (GE Life

407

Sciences) overnight at 4°C. The suspension was transferred to chromatography

408

columns and washed with PBS. IgGs were eluted from Protein G using 0.1 M glycine

(pH=3.0) and buffered in 0.1 M Tris (pH=8.0). For buffer exchange to PBS, 30 kDa

410

Amicon spin membranes (Millipore) were used. Purified IgG concentration was

411

measured using a Nanodrop (A280) and samples were stored at 4°C.

413

SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression and purification

414

The construct encoding the prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (amino

415

acids 1−1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S; GenBank: MN908947) was kindly provided by

416

Jason McLellan (Texas, USA) and described previously (Wrapp et al., 2020). In

417

detail, two proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987 were introduced for

418

prefusion state stabilization, a “GSAS” substitution at residues 682–685 to eliminate

419

the furin cleavage site, and a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif. For purification,

420

the protein is C-terminally fused to a TwinStrepTag and 8XHisTag. Protein

filtered medium was adjusted to pH 8 by adding 100 mL 10x Buffer W (1 M Tris/HCl,

429

pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, IBA lifescience) and loaded with a low pressure

surface glycoprotein

437

The RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (MN908947; aa:319-541) was expressed

438

in 293T cells from a plasmid kindly provided by Florian Krammer and purified using

439

Ni-NTA Agarose (Macherey-Nagel), as previously published (Stadlbauer et al.,

440

2020). SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain “monomer” without trimerization domain

441

(MN908947; aa:1-1207) and S1 subunit (MN908947; aa:14-529) regions of the spike

442

DNA were amplified from a synthetic gene plasmid (furin site mutated; Wrapp et al.,

443

2020) by PCR. PCR products were cloned into a modified sleeping beauty

444

transposon expression vector containing a C-terminal thrombin cleavage and a

445

double Strep II purification tag. For the S1 subunit, the tag was added at the 5’ end

446

and a BM40 signal peptide was included. For recombinant protein production, stable

447

HEK293 EBNA cell lines were generated employing the sleeping beauty transposon

448

system (Kowarz et al., 2015). Briefly, expression constructs were transfected into the

449

HEK293 EBNA cells using FuGENE HD transfection reagent (Promega). After

450

selection with puromycin, cells were induced with doxycycline. Supernatants were

451

filtered and the recombinant proteins purified via Strep-Tactin®XT (IBA Lifescience)

452

resin. Proteins were then eluted by biotin-containing TBS-buffer (IBA Lifescience),

453

and dialyzed against TBS-buffer. Ebola surface glycoprotein (EBOV Makona,

454

GenBank KJ660347) and HIV-gp140 (strain YU2), both lacking the transmembrane

455

domain and containing a GCN4 trimerization domain, were produced and purified as

456

previously described (Ehrhardt et al., 2019).

465

protein positive cells were sorted using a FACSAria Fusion (Becton Dickinson) in a

466

single cell manner into 96-well plates. All wells contained 4 µl buffer, consisting of

467

0.5x PBS, 0.5 U/µl RNAsin (Promega), 0.5 U/µl RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher

468

Scientific), and 10 mM DTT (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After sorting, plates were

469

immediately stored at -80°C until further processing.

471

Antibody heavy/light chain amplification and sequence analysis

472

Single cell amplification of antibody heavy and light chains was mainly performed as

473

previously described (Kreer et al., 2020a; Schommers et al., 2020). Briefly, reverse

474

transcription was performed with Random Hexamers (Invitrogen), and Superscript IV

475

(Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the presence of RNaseOUT (Thermo Fisher Sicentific)

476

and RNasin (Promega). cDNA was used to amplify heavy and light chains using

477

PlatinumTaq HotStart polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 6% KB extender

478

and optimized V gene-specific primer mixes (Kreer et al., 2020a) in a sequential

479

semi-nested approach with minor modifications to increase throughput (Manuscript in

480

preparation). PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis for correct sizes

481

and subjected to Sanger sequencing. For sequence analysis, chromatograms were

482

filtered for a mean Phred score of 28 and a minimal length of 240 nucleotides (nt).

483

Sequences were annotated with IgBLAST (Ye et al., 2013) and trimmed to extract

484

only the variable region from FWR1 to the end of the J gene. Base calls within the

485

variable region with a Phred score below 16 were masked and sequences with more

486

than 15 masked nucleotides, stop codons, or frameshifts were excluded from further

487

analyses. Clonal analysis was performed separately for each patient. All productive

488

heavy chain sequences were grouped by identical VH/JH gene pairs and the pairwise

489

Levenshtein distance for their CDRH3s was determined. Starting from a random

490

sequence, clone groups were assigned four sequences with a minimal CDRH3

491

amino acid identity of at least 75% (with respect to the shortest CDRH3). 100 rounds

492

of input sequence randomization and clonal assignment were performed and the

493

result with the lowest number of remaining unassigned (non-clonal) sequences was

494

selected for downstream analyses. All clones were cross-validated by the

495

investigators taking shared mutations into account. V gene usage, CDRH3 length

496

and V gene germline identity distributions for all clonal sequences (Figure 2) were

497

determined for all input sequences without further collapsing. CDRH3 hydrophobicity

498

was calculated based on the Eisenberg-scale (Eisenberg et al., 1984). V gene

499

statistics for neutralizer and non-neutralizer (Figure 3) were calculated from collapsed

500

clonal sequences.

501

For longitudinal analyses on mutation frequencies of recurring clones, a multiple

502

sequence alignment for the B cell sequences was calculated with Clustal Omega

503

(version 1.2.3; Sievers et al., 2011) using standard parameters. From this, a

504

phylogenetic tree of the sequences was estimated with RAxML through the raxmlGUI

505

(version 2.0.0-beta.11; Edler et al., 2019) using the GTRGAMMA substitution model

506

(RAxML version 8.2.12; Stamatakis, 2014). Based on the phylogenetic tree

507

distances, all variants of a clone at a given time point were matched to variants at the

508

consecutive time point and the slope between the pairs was computed. Hamming

509

distances between the pairs were determined and normalized for sequence length

510

and time difference to calculate the mean mutation frequency per day. Given the

511

median slope per clone a one-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was applied to test

512

whether the slopes are equal to zero, with the alternative hypothesis that the slopes

513

are smaller than zero. For visualizing the change of VH gene germline identity over

514

time, the germline identity for each clone was normalized by its median value at the

515

first-time measurement and the median slope was plotted.

Next generation sequencing and evaluation of healthy control IgG+ and naïve B

518

cell repertoires

519

B cell receptor repertoire sequence data was generated by an unbiased template-

520

switch-based approach as previously described (Ehrhardt et al., 2019; Schommers et

521

al., 2020). In brief, PBMCs from 48 healthy individuals (samples taken before the

522

SARS-CoV-2 outbreak) were enriched for CD19+ cells with CD19-microbeads

523

(Miltenyi

524

CD20+IgD+IgM+CD27-IgG- B cells were sorted into FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) using a BD

525

FACSAria Fusion. RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) on a

526

QiaCube (Qiagen) instrument. cDNA was generated by template-switch reverse

527

transcription according to the SMARTer RACE 5’/3’ manual using the SMARTScribe

528

Reverse Transcriptase (Takara) with a template-switch oligo including an 18-

529

nucleotide unique molecular identifier (UMI). Heavy and light chain variable regions

530

were amplified in a constant region-specific nested PCR and amplicons were used

531

for library preparation and Illumina MiSeq 2 x 300 bp sequencing. Raw NGS reads

532

were pre-processed and assembled to final sequences as previously described

533

(Ehrhardt et al., 2019). To minimize the influence of sequencing and PCR errors,

534

NGS-derived sequences were only evaluated when UMIs were found in at least three

535

reads. For the identification of overlapping clonotypes in healthy individuals a

536

maximum of one amino acid length difference and three or less differences in

537

absolute amino acid composition of CDR3s were considered as similar.

Cloning and production of monoclonal antibodies

540

Antibody cloning from 1st PCR products was performed as previously described

541

(Schommers et al., 2020) by sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC; Von

542

Boehmer et al., 2016) with a minor modification. In contrast to the published protocol,

543

PCR amplification for SLIC assembly was performed with extended primers based on

544

2nd PCR primers (Kreer et al., 2020a) covering the complete endogenous leader

545

sequence of all heavy and light chain V genes (Manuscript in preparation). Variable

546

regions with endogenous leader sequences were assembled into mammalian

547

expression vectors for IgH, IgK, or IgL and transfected into HEK293-6E cells for

548

expression, followed by Protein G-based purification of monoclonal antibodies from

549

culture supernatants as previously described (Schommers et al., 2020).

557

BSA in PBS for 60 min at RT, incubated with primary antibody in 1% BSA in PBS for

558

90 min, followed by anti-human IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech 2040-05) diluted 1:2500

559

in 1% BSA in PBS for 60 min at RT. SARS-CoV-2 spike subunit ELISAs were done

560

following a published protocol (Stadlbauer et al., 2020). ELISAs were developed with

561

ABTS solution (Thermo Fisher 002024) and absorbance was measured at 415 nm

562

and 695 nm. Positive binding was defined by an OD>0.25 and an EC50<30 µg/ml.

563

The commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kit for immunoglobulin class G was

564

provided by Euroimmun (Euroimmun Diagnostik, Lübeck, Germany). Antibody

565

detection was done according to manufacturer’s instructions and a concentration of

566

50 µg/ml of antibodies and 2 mg/ml of plasma IgG was used. The samples were

567

tested using the automated platform Euroimmun Analyzer 1.

568
569

Virus neutralization test

570

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity of poly-IgG samples or human monoclonal

571

antibodies was investigated based on a previously published protocol for MERS-

572

CoV39. Briefly, samples were serially diluted in 96-well plates starting from a

573

concentration of 1,500 µg/ml for poly-IgG and 100 µg/ml for monoclonal antibodies.

574

Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C together with 100 50% tissue culture

575

infectious doses (TCID50) SARS-CoV-2 (BavPat1/2020 isolate, European Virus

576

Archive Global # 026V-03883). Cytopathic effect (CPE) on VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-

577

1586) was analysed 4 days after infection. Neutralization was defined as absence of

578

CPE compared to virus controls. For each test, a positive control (neutralizing

579

COVID-19 patient plasma) was used in duplicates as an inter-assay neutralization

580

standard.

581
582

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) measurements

583

For SPR measurement, the RBD was additionally purified by size exclusion

584

chromatography (SEC) purification with a Superdex200 10/300 column (GE

585

Healthcare). Binding of the RBD to the various mAbs was measured using single-

586

cycle kinetics experiments with a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Purified

587

mAbs were first immobilized at coupling densities of 800-1200 response units (RU)

588

on a series S sensor chip protein A (GE Healthcare) in PBS and 0.02% sodium azide

589

buffer. One of the four flow cells on the sensor chip was empty to serve as a blank.

590

Soluble RBD was then injected at a series of concentrations (i.e. 0.8, 4, 20, 100, and

591

500 nM) in PBS at a flow rate of 60 µL/min. The sensor chip was regenerated using

592

10 mM Glycine-HCl pH 1.5 buffer. A 1:1 binding model was used to describe the

593

experimental data and to derive kinetic parameters. For some mAbs, a 1:1 binding

594

model did not provide an adequate description for binding. In these cases, we fitted a

595

two-state binding model that assumes two binding constants due to conformational

596

change. In these cases, we report the first binding constants (KD1).

597
598

HEp-2 Cell Assay

599

Monoclonal antibodies were tested at a concentration of 100 µg/ml in PBS using the

600

NOVA Lite HEp-2 ANA Kit (Inova Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s

601

instructions, including positive and negative kit controls on each substrate slide. HIV-

602

1-reactive antibodies with known reactivity profiles were included as additional

603

controls. Images were acquired using a DMI3000 B microscope (Leica) and an

604

exposure time of 3.5 s, intensity of 100%, and a gain of 10.

605
606

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

607

Flow cytometry analysis and quantifications were done by FlowJo10. Statistical

608

analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (v7), Microsoft Excel for Mac

609

(v14.7.3), Python (v3.6.8), and R (v4.0.0).
