SUMMARY

16

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads globally as a sever pandemic, which is

17

caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Cell entry of

18

SARS-CoV-2 mainly depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to angiotensin

19

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells. Therefore, repurposing of known drugs to

20

inhibit S protein-ACE2 interaction could be a quick way to develop effective therapy for

21

COVID-19. Using a high-throughput screening system to investigate the interaction

22

between spike receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and ACE2 extracellular domain, we

23

screened 3581 FDA-approved drugs and natural small molecules and identified

24

ceftazidime as a potent compound to inhibit S-RBD–ACE2 interaction by binding to S-

25

RBD. In addition to significantly inhibit S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells, ceftazidime

26

efficiently prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus to infect ACE2-expressing 293T cells.

27

The inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 113.2 μM, which is far below the blood

28

concentration (over 300 μM) of ceftazidime in patients when clinically treated with

29

recommended dose. Notably, ceftazidime is a drug clinically used for the treatment of

30

pneumonia with minimal side effects compared with other antiviral drugs. Thus,

31

ceftazidime has both anti-bacterial and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects, which should be the

32

first-line antibiotics used for the clinical treatment of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

38

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally as a severe pandemic, which

39

was caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus

40

2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1. According to the latest statistics of COVID-19 released by Johns

41

Hopkins University on September 1, 2020, there were 25.50 million confirmed cases and

42

0.85 million deaths globally. COVID-19 has become a serious threat to human survival and

43

is likely to coexist with human beings for a long time. Unfortunately, there is still no

44

effective cure for COVID-19, especially the critically ill patients.

45

Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the sarbecoviruses (Betacoronirus,
2-4

46

Coronaviridae) and can cause life-threatening respiratory diseases

47

underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection of target cells have been reported 5-7. Spike (S) protein

48

on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells by mediating virus

49

receptor recognition and membrane fusion. The N-terminal region of its S1 domain

50

contains receptor binding domain (RBD), which directly binds to angiotensin converting

51

enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the plasma membrane of host cells and is responsible for

52

virus attachment

53

effective way to inhibit the infection of target cells by SARS-CoV-2. By now, several

54

studies have reported the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting spike protein

55

10,11

56

viral infection is long. In addition, the side effects such as antibody-dependent

57

enhancement of viral infection need to be considered

58

treatment will limit the clinical application. Therefore, repurposing of known small

59

molecule drugs to inhibit spike protein and ACE2 binding could significantly accelerate

60

the deployment of effective and affordable therapies for COVID-19.

61

In this study, we expressed and purified Spike-RBD (S-RBD) and the extracellular

62

domain of ACE2 (ACE2-ECD) and then established an AlphaScreen-based high-

63

throughput system for screening small molecules that block S-RBD–ACE2-ECD

64

interaction. From 3581 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and natural

65

small molecule compounds, we identified 10 compounds that could block S-RBD–ACE2-

66

ECD interaction in the initial screening. Notably, ceftazidime bound to S-RBD and showed

67

the strongest potency for the inhibition of S-RBD binding to human pulmonary alveolar

68

epithelial cells (HPAEpiC). Moreover, ceftazidime efficiently inhibited the infection of

69

ACE2-expressing 293T cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, we identified

70

ceftazidime as a potential drug to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection with minimal known side

71

effects and affordable price.

RESULTS

74

Establishment of AlphaScreen system to detect S-RBD–ACE2 interaction

75

In order to screen small molecules that block S protein-ACE2 binding, we firstly

76

established an AlphaScreen-based high-throughput system to detect the interaction

77

between S-RBD and ACE2-ECD (Fig. 1a). S-RBD and ACE2-ECD were expressed in

78

293T cells and then purified. Biotinylated ACE2-ECD (ACE2-ECD-Biotin) binds to

79

streptavidin-coated Alpha donor beads and His-tagged S-RBD (S-RBD-His) binds to anti-

80

His-conjugated AlphaLISA acceptor beads. When S-RBD binds to ACE2-ECD, the two

81

beads come into close proximity. Upon illumination at 680 nm, the donor beads generate

82

singlet oxygen molecules that diffuse to acceptor beads and transfer energy to thioxene

83

derivatives in the acceptor beads resulting in light emission at 520-620 nm. The results

84

showed that the incubation of ACE2-ECD-Biotin with S-RBD-His produced very strong

85

AlphaScreen signal, and the signal decreased to the basal level in the absence of either of

86

the two proteins (Fig. 1b). To confirm the specificity of this AlphaScreen system, we

87

replaced S-RBD-His with His-tagged extracellular domains of other membrane proteins,

88

including mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) and vascular

89

cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Co-incubation of MAdCAM-1-His or VCAM-1-His

90

with ACE2-ECD-Biotin did not generate AlphaScreen signal, indicating that the system

91

detects S-RBD―ACE2 interaction specifically (Fig. 1c).

92

High-throughput screening of small molecules blocking S-RBD–ACE2 interaction

93

Next, we used the AlphaScreen-based high-throughput system to screen small molecules

94

that block S-RBD–ACE2 interaction. A total of 3581 small molecule compounds with

95

known molecular structures from FDA Approved Drug Library, Spectrum Collection and

96

Targetmol-Natural Compound Library were assessed (Fig. 1d). The assay was conducted

97

at a final compound concentration of 10 μM and the interaction between S-RBD-His (0.1

98

μM) and ACE2-ECD-Biotin (0.2 μM) was analyzed. After first round screening, 75

99

candidate compounds were identified, which showed inhibitory effect on S-RBD–ACE2

100

interaction (Fig. 1d). All these compounds showed over 45% inhibition rate according to

101

the changes in AlphaScreen signal. To exclude the interference of the compounds to the

102

AlphaScreen system per se, we designed a negative selection system in which the

103

biotinylated S-RBD-His links streptavidin-coated Alpha donor bead and anti-His-

104

conjugated AlphaLISA acceptor bead together to generate AlphaScreen signal directly (Fig.

105

1e). After the negative selection, 10 compounds, including bleomycin sulfate, levodopa,

106

norepinephrine, trientine hydrochloride, ceftazidime, chiniofon, hematein, theaflavin,

107

bleomycin and myricetin, from the 75 candidate compounds were validated to inhibit S-

108

RBD―ACE2 interaction effectively. Among the 10 compounds, ceftazidime was the most

109

potent inhibitor which showed a relative inhibition rate of 80.7% (Fig. 1f). Thus,

110

ceftazidime was selected for further investigation considering the best inhibitory effect on

111

S-RBD―ACE2 interaction, the anti-inflammatory effect and the minimal side effect of

112

this drug compared with the other 9 compounds 14-17 (Fig. 1g).

134

To investigate whether S-RBD or ACE2 is the binding target protein of ceftazidime, we

135

applied a bio-layer interferometry experiment to examine the binding affinity between

136

ceftazidime and S-RBD or ACE2-ECD. Along with the elevated concentration of

137

ceftazidime, this compound showed increased binding to S-RBD protein with an KD value

138

of 260 ± 38 μM (Fig. 2a). Notably, ceftazidime hardly dissociated from S-RBD, indicating

139

a strong and stable interaction between ceftazidime and S-RBD. By contrast, ceftazidime

140

and ACE2-ECD showed no specific binding signal (Fig. 2b). Thus, ceftazidime binds to S-

141

RBD specifically.

ceftazidime to S-RBD and ACE2-ECD were measured by bio-layer interferometry in an
Octet RED96 instrument. The biotin-conjugated S-RBD or ACE2-ECD was captured by
streptavidin that was immobilized on a biosensor and tested for binding with gradient
concentrations of ceftazidime.

150

Lung is the main organ infected by SARS-CoV-2, which cause severe acute respiratory

151

syndrome (SARS) 18,19. Therefore, we examined the inhibitory effect of ceftazidime on the

152

binding of S-RBD protein to human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiC) which

153

express ACE2. Addition of 100 μM ceftazidime into the soluble S-RBD binding assay

154

system led to a significantly decrease in the S-RBD binding signal (Fig. 3a), demonstrating

155

the efficient inhibition on S-RBD binding to HPAEpiC cells by ceftazidime. Further

156

analysis showed an IC50 of 39.90 ± 1.11 μM (Fig. 3b).

Pseudovirus has the similar infectivity compared with authentic virus, thus has been widely

171

applied to carry out the research on the intrusion mechanism of virus with high infectivity

172

and pathogenicity 4. To evaluate the inhibitory effect of ceftazidime on the entry of SARS-

173

CoV-2 pseudovirus into 293T cells overexpressing human ACE2, we added ceftazidime

174

into the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection assay system at a series of concentrations. The

175

results showed that ceftazidime efficiently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry

176

in vitro and the IC50 was 113.24 ± 1.23 μM (Fig. 4). Of note, ceftazidime showed no

177

detectable cytotoxicity at a high concentration of 400 μM, indicating its safety for clinical

178

usage (Fig. 4). Thus, ceftazidime has both anti-bacterial and anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects and

179

should be considered as the first-line antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19.

DISCUSSION

188

Up to date, studies on COVID-19 therapeutics development mostly focus on screening and

189

validation of neutralizing antibodies and the development of vaccine, both require a

190

relatively long time for the effectivity validation and safety assessment. An effective drug

191

with minimal side effect for COVID-19 treatment is eagerly needed. Therefore,

192

repurposing of FDA-approved drugs with minimal known side effects will accelerate the

193

deployment of effective and affordable therapies for COVID-19. In this study, we found

194

that ceftazidime, an antibiotic used for the treatment of pneumonia, has strong inhibitory

195

effect on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus cell entry in vitro by inhibiting the S-RBD–ACE2

196

interaction. It is noteworthy that ceftazidime has anti-SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and anti-

197

bacterial infection dual functions with little known side effects, which make is ready for

198

immediate preclinical and clinical trials for the COVID-19.

199

Ceftazidime has been widely used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Compared

200

with other compounds that we identified showing inhibition on S-RBD–ACE2 interaction,

201

ceftazidime has less toxicity and side effects. Except for the patients with allergic history

202

of cephalosporins, most COVID-19 patients can be treated with this drug. Ceftazidime has

203

been clinically used as a drug for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia and the blood

204

concentration of ceftazidime can reach over 300 μM. At this concentration, ceftazidime

205

showed an 96% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in vitro, indicating its

206

strong potency to inhibit cell entry of SARS-CoV-2.

207

Cephalosporins have many derivatives which share the similar core structure but have

208

different side-chain modifications. We have also compared the inhibitory effects of 14

209

different cephalosporins, including ceftazidime, cephradine, cefazolin, cephalexin,

10

210

cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefuroxime axetil, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone,

211

cefoselis, cefepime, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Among all cephalosporins, only

212

ceftazidime showed strong inhibition on the S-RBD–ACE2 interaction. Ceftobiprole and

213

ceftriaxone showed limited inhibitory effects, whereas other cephalosporins have little or

214

no inhibitory effect on S-RBD–ACE2 binding (Extended Data Fig. 1). These results in

215

combination with a preliminary Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis suggested

216

that the unique moieties in ceftazidime, including 2-aminothiazole, oxime protected with a

217

terminal-exposed isobutyric acid and the positive charged pyridine, might be involved in

218

mediating the binding to S-RBD and eventually blocked the protein interaction between S-

219

RBD and ACE2. Furthermore, our data showed that ceftazidime hardly dissociated from

220

the S-RBD proteins (Fig. 2a), which could be due to the covalent binding of ceftazidime to

221

S-RBD.

ACE2. Since ceftazidime is a drug clinically used for the treatment of pneumonia with

232

affordable price and minimal side effects compared with other antiviral drugs, ceftazidime

233

should be considered as the first-line antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19,

234

which deserves the immediate preclinical and clinical trials. Optimization of the molecular

235

structure of ceftazidime may further improve the inhibitory effect of this drug on SARS-

236

CoV-2 infection.

In summary, we identify ceftazidime as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

METHODS

318

Protein expression and purification

319

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD fused with Fc/His tag (S-RBD-His) was produced in

320

293T cells and purified with Protein A Agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Recombinant

321

human ACE2-ECD fused with Flag/His tag was produced in 293T cells and purified with

322

anti-DYKDDDDK G1 Affinity Resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions

323

(GenScript).

324

AlphaScreen

325

AlphaScreen assays were performed in Costar 384-well microplates in a 20 μl final reaction

326

volume. Streptavidin-coated Alpha donor beads or anti-His-conjugated AlphaLISA

327

acceptor beads (PerkinElmer) were used at a final concentration of 10 μg/mL per well. The

328

assays were performed in PBS buffer (155 mM NaCl, 1.06 mM KH2PO4, 2.97 mM

329

Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and 0.1% BSA. 5 μl S-RBD-His (final concentration 0.1 μM) and 5 μl

330

ACE2-ECD-Biotin (final concentration 0.2 μM) were pre-incubated with compounds at a

331

final concentration of 10 μM for 0.5 h at 4 °C. Then donor beads and acceptor beads were

332

added into the reaction in dark for 2 h, at room temperature. Laser excitation was carried

333

out at 680 nm, and readings were performed at 520 to 620 nm using the EnVision

334

(PerkinElmer) plate reader.

335

Flow cytometry

336

0.1 μM S-RBD-Fc/His was pre-incubated with 5 μg/mL FITC-conjugated goat anti-human

337

IgG in 50 μL of PBS and then incubated with HPAEpiC cells for 30 min at room

338

temperature. Cells were washed twice before flow cytometry analysis. Cells were

339

incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG merely as a control.

340

Pseudovirus infection assay

341

SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were produced as previously described 20. The pseudoviruses

342

were diluted in complete DMEM mixed with an equal volume (50 μl) of diluted DMSO or

343

ceftazidime, and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was transferred to 293T

344

expressing human ACE2 stable cell line cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h,

345

followed by lysed with Bio-Lite Luciferase Assay Buffer and tested for luciferase activity

346

(Vazyme). The percent neutralization was calculated by comparing the luciferase value of

347

ceftazidime treatment group to that of DMSO control.

348

Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) Experiment

349

The BLI experiment was performed using an Octet Red 96 instrument (ForteBio, Inc.).

350

Briefly, biotinylated S-RBD or ACE2-ECD (50 μg/ml) were immobilized on streptavidin

351

(SA) biosensors and then incubated with gradient concentrations of ceftazidime in kinetics

352

buffer (PBS and 0.02% Tween-20). The association and dissociation steps were set to 360

353

s and 600 s. The KD value of the S-RBD binding affinity for ceftazidime was calculated

354

from all the binding curves based on their global fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model with

355

an R2 value of ≥ 0.95. Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C. Data were analyzed

356

using Octet Data Analysis Software 9.0 (ForteBio, Menlo park, CA, USA).

357

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

358

Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test (GraphPad, version 5.01). The

359

resulting p values are indicated as follows: ns, not significant; *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01;

360

***, p < 0.001. Data represent the mean ± SEM of at least two independent experiments.
