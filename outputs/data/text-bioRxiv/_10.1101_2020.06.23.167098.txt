Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) on human cells. Beyond the lung, COVID-19 impacts diverse tissues including the kidney.
ACE2 is a key member of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) which regulates
blood pressure, largely through its effects on the kidney. RAAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors
(ACEi) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) are widely used therapies for hypertension,
cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases, and therefore, there is intense interest in their effect
on ACE2 expression and its implications for SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. Here, we analyzed
single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq of human kidney to interrogate the association of
ACEi/ARB use with ACE2 expression in specific cell types. First, we performed an integrated
analysis aggregating 176,421 cells across 49 donors, 8 studies and 8 centers, and adjusting for
sex, age, donor and center effects, to assess the relationship of ACE2 with age and sex at
baseline. We observed a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression in tubular epithelial
cells of the thin loop of Henle (tLoH) in males relative to females at younger ages, the trend
reversing, and losing significance with older ages. ACE2 expression in tLoH increases with age
in females, with an opposite, weak effect in males. In an independent cohort, we detected a
statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with ACEi/ARB use in epithelial cells of the
proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, and endothelial cells, but the association was
confounded in this small cohort by the underlying disease. Our study illuminates the dynamics of
ACE2 expression in specific kidney cells, with implications for SARS-CoV-2 entry and
pathogenicity.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for
the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, enters human cells through the binding of
its spike (S) protein to the host cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1, 2).
Subsequent cleavage by one of several accessory host proteases, including transmembrane
protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L (CTSL), is required for successful viral entry and
replication (3). While the nasal, lung and gut epithelia are primary targets of SARS-CoV-2
infection, complications affecting multiple organ systems suggest the virus impacts other tissues,
and studies have described RNA expression of ACE2 in diverse tissues including the gut, heart,
liver, kidney, olfactory epithelium, brain and vasculature (4, 5). To date, little is known about the
cell-type specific expression patterns of ACE2 in human kidney in a large enough cohort to allow
us to account for factors such as age and sex that appear to be critical for susceptibility to SARSCoV-2 and severity of disease.
ACE2 is a key component of a more recently recognized counter-regulatory arm of the ReninAngiotensin-Aldosterone system (RAAS (6)), critical for regulating blood pressure. ACE2 is
located on the X chromosome, and RAAS activity has been reported to exhibit sex-specific
differences (7, 8). ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II) to the vasodilatory peptide Ang-(1-7),
angiotensin I to Ang-(1-9) (also cleaved to Ang-(1-7) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) or
neprilysin), and angiotensin A to alamandine (9), a peptide mediating similar actions as Ang-(17). Together, this non-classical arm of the RAAS counteracts the vasoconstrictive, proliferative
and inflammatory effects of the classical RAAS, mediated by Ang II (generated from angiotensin
I by the action of ACE). ACE2 therefore acts as a critical regulator of the Ang II versus Ang-(1-7)
balance to prevent deleterious high blood pressure and tissue inflammation, especially in the
kidney, where ACE2 has been previously detected at the brush borders of tubular epithelial cells
and at lower levels within glomeruli (10).
The RAAS is frequently targeted in the treatment of hypertension and chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Common drug modulators of RAAS include ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and Angiotensin
Receptor Blockers (ARBs). ACEi block the conversion of Angiotensin I to Ang II by ACE, while
ARBs block the binding of Ang II to Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R), and inhibit its vasoconstrictive
effects. The association between ACE2 expression and activity with ACEi/ARB use is not clearly
defined (11); results largely depend on the model system (rodents, humans), the specific drug
tested, and the tissue of investigation (12–15).
COVID-19 is associated with greater disease severity and mortality in older individuals, in men,
and in those with comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus and CKD (16, 17). Since ACE2 acts
as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, there has been widespread debate (18, 19) if altered ACE2
expression and RAAS regulation in patients taking ACEi/ARBs affects the pathogenicity of SARSCoV-2 infection. Two recent large population-based, case-control studies found no significant
association between the use of RAAS blockers and risk or severity of COVID-19, regardless of
sex or age (20, 21). However, disease severity was narrowly defined in these studies based on
clinical manifestations affecting the lung. Thus, there remains an urgent need for a deeper

understanding of the dynamics and relationship between ACE2 expression and ACEi/ARB use at
the level of individual cells, and adjusted for age, sex and other confounders in other organ
systems, especially the kidney.
To investigate whether ACE2 expression in the kidney, a key RAAS tissue, may be influenced
by ACEi/ARB use, we examined transcriptomic data that we had collected at the level of individual
kidney cells to answer two key questions: (1) what are the effects of age and sex on ACE2
expression at the single cell level in the human kidney? (2) Is there a link between the use of
ACEi/ARB and ACE2 expression in the kidney?

Results and Discussion
A cross-study integrated-analysis of kidney cells associates ACE2 expression with age
and sex in the thin loop of Henle
We investigated ACE2 expression in the kidneys of individuals on RAAS blockers, by examining
single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq (sc/snRNA-seq) data, accounting for age and sex as
covariates in the statistical analysis. We first generated a reference atlas of kidney with no known
pathology (in the tissue sampled) for the association of ACE2 expression in individual kidney cell
types with sex and age, aggregating 8 independent scRNA-seq or snRNA-seq studies from 8
independent centers (Dataset S1) for a total of 176,421 cells profiled from 49 donors (20 females,
29 males), and whose median age was 57 with an IQR of 14. We co-embedded the combined
“integrated analysis” dataset adjusting for donor batch effect, and then performed graph-based
clustering to derive 24 broad cell subsets (Methods, Figure S1A), which we annotated post hoc,
including podocytes, proximal, distal and collecting duct tubular epithelial cells, immune and
stromal cells (Methods, Figure S1B), of which 15 subsets had cells from at least 40 donors. No
cell subset segregated by sex.
Overall, the proportion of cells expressing ACE2 (ACE2+) varied by cell subset from 0% to 9.87%
(Figure S1B). To account for technical variability, we examined the ACE2+ proportion within each
donor per cell subset. The thin loop of Henle (tLoH) had the highest mean percentage (13.7%) of
ACE2+ cells per donor, followed by proximal convoluted tubular cells (PCT, 7%), parietal epithelial
cells (PEC, 4.6%) and vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMC, 3.5%) (Figure 1A).
To associate ACE2 expression with donor age and sex, we fit a mixed effect Poisson regression
model to cell subsets with at least 40 ACE2+ cells across donors, with age, sex and their
interaction as covariates, and nested random effects for donors and center (Methods, Figure
1B). We found a statistically significant association (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05) between age,
sex and ACE2 expression in the tLoH cell subset (Figure S2A, Dataset S2). ACE2 expression
trended upwards with age in females (Figure 1C). In males, ACE2 expression trended
downwards with age, and was not statistically significant (Figure 1D, Methods). Overall, the sex
effect was statistically significant at younger ages, where males had higher expression relative to
females. With older ages, the gap narrows, eventually reversing direction and is no longer

significant (Figure 1E, 1F, 1G). We performed cross-validation to check for robustness of the
results to dataset origin, using our recently developed strategy (5) (Methods, Dataset S2). The
direction of association for age, sex and their interaction for tLoH was preserved and consistent
in the cross-validation analysis, except that excluding the “Sanger'' dataset removed their
statistical significance (Dataset S2). The Sanger dataset is the largest by number of donors (13
donors; 7 females, 6 males), widest age range (2y to 72y) and second largest in number of cells
(40,198 cells). To capture subtler effects, we fit a simpler fixed effects Poisson regression model
with age, sex, their interaction and dataset as covariates, alongside a pseudo-bulk analysis to
validate that single-cell effects are consistent on the donor level, and cross validation (5)
(Methods, Dataset S2). A caveat of the integrated analysis is that aggregating cells to broader
cell categories across various batches may lead to loss of within-class cellular heterogeneity.
Effect sizes may differ across the subclasses, thus impacting their estimation. In conclusion, at
baseline, ACE2 expression had a statistically significant association with both age in females and
sex at younger ages in the tLoH cells. Because of the higher median age in our integrated analysis
dataset, larger cohorts with wider age ranges are necessary to validate the results.
Association of RAAS blockade with ACE2 expression in the kidney epithelial and
endothelial cells confounded by underlying disease
Next, to test the association of renal ACE2 expression with ACEi/ARB use, we surveyed ACE2
expression in 32,239 nuclei obtained by droplet-based snRNA-seq of frozen kidney samples from
an independent cohort of 11 patients: 9 kidney biopsies with features of various kidney diseases
including Lupus nephritis (LN) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) (Table 1) and 2 cortical samples from
a tumor nephrectomy and transplant nephrectomy with rejection and recurrent Focal Segmental
Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). 6 of the 9 biopsied patients were either on Lisinopril (ACEi) or
Losartan (ARB). Nuclei were isolated using one of two protocols (Methods, Table 1). Graph
based clustering and post hoc annotation (Methods) identified 14 broad cell classes (Figure
S3A), including epithelial, immune and stromal cells, of which 8 classes had greater than 5 nuclei
expressing ACE2 (Figure 2A). In contrast to the baseline analysis, PCT cells had the highest
proportion of ACE2+ cells across this patient cohort, we did not recover tLoH nuclei, and PECs
had fewer than 5 ACE2+ nuclei. To account for technical sampling differences, we analyzed
ACE2+ cell proportions for each individual patient (Figure 2B).
Because the number of observations per cell type was not large enough to consistently fit a
complex model that accounts for both donor variability as a random effect and an interaction
between age and sex, we fit a Poisson mixed effects model of ACE2 gene expression counts in
cell classes with greater than 5 ACE2+ nuclei, with the donor as the random covariate to account
for batch effects, while adjusting for age and sex as covariates but not their interaction or center
effect as all samples came from the same cohort (Methods, Dataset S3, Figure 2C). In all cases,
we sampled cells so that the distributions of the number of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs)
were matched between patients on and off ACEi/ARBs to account for sequencing depth
differences.

ACEi/ARB use was associated (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05) with increased ACE2 expression
in select epithelial cells (PCT, Thick Ascending Limb (TAL)) and in endothelial cells (EC). There
was also a statistically significant increase in ACE2 expression with age in the TAL-1 cells. To
capture more subtle effects, we also fit a simpler fixed effects model, without accounting for donor
effect, but with an interaction term between sex and age, alongside a pseudo-bulk analysis ((5),
Methods). The direction of the effect and statistical significance for ACEi/ARB use and age were
preserved in PCT, TAL and EC. The pseudo-bulk analysis also preserved the direction of effect
sizes. We found no new effects with the simpler model (Dataset S3). The biopsy cohort differs
from the baseline cohort in having a lower median age (45 vs 57), wider age range (IQR of 19.5),
and a higher female to male ratio (8:3). Taken together, neither the baseline nor the biopsy cohort
analysis found a robust association between ACE2 expression and sex or age in classical PCT
cells. Importantly, the biopsy cohort showed a higher expression of ACE2 in PCTs, TAL and ECs
in patients taking ACEi/ARBs.
A limitation of the study is the small sample size of the biopsy cohort which does not allow us to
adequately model the underlying kidney pathology without confounding with RAAS blockade
treatment. In particular, as donors had a variety of different kidney diseases, we grouped them
into broad disease categories: IgAN (n=3), LN (n=4) and Others (n=4). Because patients in the
“Others” category were not treated with ACEi/ARB, the disease and treatment are confounded.
Accordingly, when we fit the Poisson model with donor as random effect, and RAAS blockade,
age, sex as fixed effects but included an additional fixed covariate for disease category
(Methods), the association with RAAS no longer held (consistent with confounding), but the age
effect in TAL-1 was preserved. In a simpler model with just the donor effect and disease status,
LN was associated with ACE2 expression in PCT, EC and TAL (Dataset S3). Our results highlight
the need for further investigation with disease stratification and with greater power, to verify if the
disease (LN) and RAAS blockade effects counter each other or if there is a true disease effect. In
addition to the impact of underlying kidney pathology, other caveats to address in larger studies
are ACEi/ARB dose variability and duration of use (although all patients were normotensive at the
time of tissue collection), the impact of experimental protocols (freezing, storage and nuclei
isolation), and sampling variability in cell composition and depth of sequencing.
Reported manifestations of kidney involvement in COVID-19 patients range from urinary
abnormalities and mild functional impairment, to severe acute kidney injury necessitating renal
replacement therapy, associated with excess mortality risk (22). In addition to potential effects of
ischemia and the cytokine storm associated with the systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
there are reports of a direct viral cytopathic effect mediating kidney tubular injury (23–26).
Postmortem examination of kidney tissue from COVID-19 patients revealed evidence of SARSCoV/SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein in tubular epithelium and coronavirus particles in the
cytoplasm of the proximal, and to a lesser extent distal, tubular epithelium (23, 24). Features
suggestive of intracellular virus assembly were also observed (25). Prominent ACE2 staining has
also been seen in the proximal tubules of COVID-19 patients, along with focal parietal epithelial
cell staining (and occasional weaker podocyte staining) (23). In one report, tubular SARS-CoV-2
was accompanied by tubulointerstitial macrophage infiltration and tubular C5b-9 deposition (24).

These data raise the possibility that viral entry into the kidney and any downstream inflammation
may be exaggerated when ACE2 expression is upregulated.
In sum, our study provides data at the single-cell level in the kidney, an organ with observed
SARS-CoV-2 tropism. Our integrated analysis revealed a statistically significant association
between ACE2 expression, and age and sex in the thin loop of Henle. The varying trends in ACE2
expression with age and sex in the kidney imply a more complex relationship between gene
expression and simple demographic variables like age and sex, which needs further investigation
in larger cohorts with wider-ranging ages. The use of ACEi/ARBs was likely confounded with
underlying Lupus nephritis in relation to ACE2 levels in the proximal tubular, thick ascending limb
and endothelial cells in the kidney after adjustment for age and sex. Assessing if increased ACE2
expression is beneficial or harmful in settings of disease or RAAS blockade, requires further
mechanistic investigation, in addition to studies in larger patient cohorts. Whether such
transcriptional changes also play a role in SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the kidney remains an open
question that we may only be able to confidently answer once large clinical cohorts are analyzed
at the end of the current pandemic. Further, all our data comes from non-COVID-19 samples, and
the effect of virus infection on ACE2 expression is yet to be determined.

Materials and methods
Datasets used in the baseline integrated analysis
We included 8 datasets in the integrated analysis for a total of 176,421 cells (Dataset S1) post
quality control filtering (see below). In addition to an internal unpublished single-cell cohort, we
aggregated control kidney single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq data from 7 published studies
for a total of 49 donors (29 males, 20 females) with a median age of 57 (min 2y, max 72y, IQR=14).
Public datasets were obtained at the level of gene expression counts post genome alignment and
gene-level quantification as published by each study’s authors (Dataset S1). For 2 donors (AMP
dataset), only age ranges were available, so mean ages were computed.
Single nucleus isolation from human kidney tissue
Frozen kidney biopsy specimens or frozen samples of macroscopically normal cortex from tumor
nephrectomies (distant from the tumor site), were obtained after appropriate patient (discarded
tissue) consent and in accordance with Partners Healthcare IRB and institutional guidelines. One
of two protocols (utilizing either nuclei EZ lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) or a salt
Tris-based buffer (27, 28)) was used to isolate nuclei from these; in the case of kidney biopsy
tissue, the surrounding OCT embedding medium was first removed using PBS. 8,000 or 10,000
single nuclei were loaded into each channel of the Chromium single cell 3’ chip, according to use
of the v2 or v3 kit respectively (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, USA).
Single cell isolation from human kidney tissue
Samples of macroscopically normal cortex were obtained from tumor nephrectomy specimens,
distant from the tumor site, after appropriate patient consent and in accordance with IRB and
institutional guidelines as above. Following transfer in 2% heat-inactivated FBS RPMI, tissue was
cut into 1mm x 1mm cubes and placed in 0.25mg/ml liberase TH dissociation medium (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, USA). Following further dissection, the tissue was incubated at 37°C
for 1 hour at 600rpm. Samples were regularly triturated during the incubation period using a 1ml
pipette, after which the digestion was stopped by the addition of 10% heat-inactivated FBS RPMI.
The addition of ACK lysing buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) following
centrifugation at 500g for 5 minutes at room temperature, was performed twice in light of the lack
of perfusion prior to nephrectomy. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was incubated with Accumax
at 37°C for 3 minutes (Innovative Cell Technologies Inc, San Diego, USA), with 10% FBS RPMI
again used for its subsequent neutralization. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 0.4%
BSA/PBS and filtered using a 30um CellTrics filter (Sysmex America Inc, Lincolnshire, USA). Cell
viability and concentration were determined using trypan blue, with 10,000 cells loaded into the
10x Genomics microfluidic system according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (10x Genomics,
Pleasanton, USA).
Droplet-based sn/scRNA-seq
Single nuclei or cells were partitioned into gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) and incubated to
generate barcoded cDNA by reverse transcription. Barcoded cDNA was then amplified by PCR
prior to library construction. Fragmentation, sample index and adaptor ligation, and PCR were
used to generate libraries of paired-end constructs according to the manufacturer’s

recommendations (10x Genomics, Pleasanton, USA). Libraries were pooled and sequenced
using the Illumina HiSeq X system (San Diego, USA). Whenever feasible, we pooled 10x libraries
on sequencing lanes to ensure that any individual sample was not confounded by batch (kidney
section, day of sample collection, condition, timepoint) and were randomly distributed across
lanes.
Preprocessing of 10x droplet-based sequencing outputs
We
used
the
Cellranger
toolkit
(v2.1.1,
v3,
10X
Genomics
https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-iscell-ranger) to de-multiplex (cellranger mkfastq) the sequencing outputs, and for alignment
(cellranger count) to the reference transcriptome (GRCh38 for human cells, GRCh38 pre-mRNA
for human nuclei), and quantification of gene expression.
Cell type identification and annotation
Quality control and normalization
All sc/snRNA-seq data analysis except co-embedding was done using the package Seurat (v2.3
(29) and v3.1 (30)). For the integrated analysis, we used the merge function to merge the
expression count matrices. We used the FilterCells or subset function to retain cells that had read
mapping to a minimum of 200 genes and raised the maximal mitochondrial threshold for cell
inclusion to 40% mitochondrial gene reads as the kidney is a highly metabolically active organ.
We normalized the data using total sum scaling followed by multiplication by a factor of 105(TPX),
and log-transformation using a pseudocount of 1 by the NormalizeData function to obtain
log(TPX+1) values. Next, we identified high varying expression features using the
FindVariableGenes function using default parameters for the biopsy cohort, and the
FindVariableFeatures function with variance stabilization for the baseline integrated analysis. We
computed the top 20 principal components (PCs) using the RunPCA function on the expression
matrix composed of only the 2,000 most highly variable genes after mean centering and scaling
using the ScaleData function.
Joint analyses of human cells from multiple donors
Batch effects are often detected by segregation of clusters by technical factors (e.g., donor origin,
replicate, day of sequencing etc.) rather than expected biological identity. The single nuclei profile
initially separated by donor. We used the Harmony v1 (31) R package to co-embed human singlecell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data prior to clustering and visualization. Each donor was used
as a separate batch.
Cell type identification
We performed clustering using the FindClusters function on the top 20 Harmony dimensions at
a resolution of 1. FindClusters builds a shared k-nearest neighbor (k-NN, k=20) graph followed
by community detection to determine clusters. We first used a resolution of 1, followed by merging
of subsets in case of overclustering to retain major cell types after computing marker genes by
differential expression (below). For 2-D visualization of the data by way of Uniform Manifold

Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP), we ran the RunUMAP function
on the 20 Harmony dimensions, and with default parameters.
Cell type annotation and signatures
We used the FindAllMarkers function with default parameters to compute highly differentially
expressed (DE) genes distinguishing each cluster from all other cells using the Wilcoxon RankSum text with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR adjustment (32). We generated a database of literaturederived genes for kidney parenchymal, stromal and immune cell types. We annotated clusters by
checking the presence of literature-derived, cell type-specific genes among the top DE genes
when possible. Cells were annotated at the level of broad cell types.
Modeling age and sex effects on ACE2 expression
We first fit a mixed effect model (Eq 1) that explicitly models donor and dataset or center
variability. Because of its complexity for the current dataset, it likely captures the most prominent
effects. So we also fit a less complex fixed effects model (Eq 2) without modeling donor variability.
A pseudo-bulk analysis at the donor level was used to validate the direction of effect sizes. For
both models, datasets were held out to determine robustness of the model results to dataset
variability.
To test the effect of age and sex on ACE2 expression, we fit a Poisson mixed effects model to
the integrated analysis dataset:
ACE2k,s ~ Ages + Sexs + Age*Sex + (1|donors) + (1|centerk)

(Eq 1)

where ACE2 is the gene expression of ACE2 in cell k and donor s in units of UMI counts. The
total number of UMIs was added as an offset after scaling to have mean 1 and log-transformed.
Age and Sex denote the age and sex of the donors in numerical years and binary “Female
(reference)/Male”, respectively. The donor and dataset were modeled as nested random effects
to account for batch effects. An interaction term was added to model the relationship between
age and sex. We used the glmer function in the lme4 (33) package to fit the model and compute
p-values for individual coefficients.
The combined effect of sex and age can be summarized as: βage + βsex + sex*age*βage:sex where
βage:sex is the interaction term and age is the numeric age, and sex is a binary variable (0 for
females, 1 for male).
The sex effect can be summarized as: βsex + age*βage:sex
The age effect can be summarized as: βage + sex*βage:sex
For females (sex=0), the effect size is βage
For males (sex=1) the effect size is βage + sex*βage:sex

glmer only computes uncertainty for and tests the individual coefficients. We computed
uncertainties for the combined coefficients for age and sex effects by computing CT*𝝨*C where C
is the vector of independent variables of interest, and 𝝨 is the variance-covariance matrix of the
fitted model. The combined effects and computed standard errors were subjected to a Wald test
of statistical significance. Multiple hypothesis test correction was performed using the method of
Benjamini-Hochberg (32) (FDR=5%). We performed leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) at
the level of datasets to validate effect size direction and statistical significance.
To validate the direction of effects, pseudo-bulk analysis was performed by computing the mean
ACE2 expression count and mean UMI count across cells per cell type per donor. Using donors
as observations, and the dataset as a random covariate, we fit the following Poisson mixed effect
model to each cell type with the log-transformed mean UMI count as offset:
mean_ACE2s ~ Ages + Sexs + Age*Sex + (1|centers) + offset(log(mean_nUMI))
For capturing less complex effects, we fit the following Poisson regression model (5) with fixed
effects and log-transformed UMI counts as offset:
ACE2k,s ~ Ages + Sexs + Ages*Sexs + datasetk
(Eq 2)
We used the glm function in R to fit the model. Pseudo-bulk analysis was performed by taking the
mean counts as described above.
Testing association between RAAS blockade and ACE2 expression
To test the association between ACEi/ARB use and ACE2 transcription, we fit the following
Poisson mixed effects model to each cell type in the biopsy cohort:
ACE2k,s ~ ACEi/ARBs + Ages + Sexs + (1|donors)

(Eq 3)

where ACE2 is the gene expression of ACE2 in cell k and donor s in units of UMI counts. The
total number of UMIs was added as an offset after scaling to have mean 1 and log-transformed.
ACEi/ARB is the binary status “Yes/No” of whether the donor s was on the drug or not. Age and
Sex denote the age and sex of the donor s in numerical years and binary “Female
(reference)/Male”, respectively. The donor was modeled as a random covariate to account for
batch effects. We used the glmer function in the lme4 (33) package to fit the model and compute
p-values. Multiple hypothesis test correction was performed using the method of BenjaminiHochberg (32) (FDR=5%).
For the fixed effects model, we used the glm function in R to fit the following Poisson regression
model:
ACE2k,s ~ ACEi/ARBs + Ages + Sexs + Ages*Sexs
(Eq 4)
Pseudo-bulk analysis was performed as described above.
To model pathology, we fit the following two models:
ACE2k,s ~ ACEi/ARBs + Diseases + Ages + Sexs + (1|donors)
Because of its complexity, we could only fit (Eq 5) to 5 cell types.

(Eq 5)

Next, we fit a simpler model to determine disease-specific effects to all cell types with at least 5
ACE2+ nuclei.
ACE2k,s ~ Diseases + (1|donors)
(Eq 6)
Plotting and visualization
All analysis was performed in the R statistical computing environment (v3.6). We used the R
visualization packages ggplot2 v3.2.1 (34), cowplot v0.9.4 (35), ggpubr v0.2.5 (36) and patchwork
v1.0.0.9 (36, 37) for generation of boxplots, violin plots, proportional bar plots, UMAP visualization
and dotplots. Data was wrangled using the tidyverse (38) framework (dplyr v0.8.3, tidyr v1.0).
Availability of datasets and code
The “integrated analysis” baseline dataset will be available as a resource on the Single-Cell Portal
(SCP937)). Raw expression counts for ACE2 for the unpublished nephrectomy and biopsy
cohorts will also be available in the same study. Code used in the analysis will be made available
at https://github.com/ayshwaryas/kidney_scmetaanalysis_c19
