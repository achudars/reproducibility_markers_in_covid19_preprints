Summary

30

The unprecedented epidemic of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus, HCoV-19, in

31

China and beyond has caused public health concern at a global scale. Although bats are

32

regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-19 , the origins of the virus remain unclear.

33

Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a

34

metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China

35

between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at

36

the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the

37

closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to

38

HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-

39

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19,

40

RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the

41

S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion

42

events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from

43

multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and

44

other wildlife species.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are common viral respiratory pathogens that primarily cause symptoms

48

in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In 1960s, two CoVs, 229E and OC43, were

49

identified in clinical samples from patients experiencing the common cold . More recently,

50

four additional human CoVs have been successively identified: severe acute respiratory

51

syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, NL63 in late 2004, HKU1 in January 2005, and

52

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. However, only two

53

betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, are able to cause severe and fatal

54

infections, leading to 774 and 858 deaths, respectively, suggesting that beta-CoVs may be of

55

particular concern to human health. In December 2019, viral pneumonia caused by an

56

unidentified microbial agent was reported, which was soon identified to be a novel

57

coronavirus , now termed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of

58

Viruses and HCoV-19 by a group of Chinese scientists . The number of patients infected with

59

HCoV-19 has increased sharply since January 21, 2020, and as of March 2rd, 2020, more than

60

80,000 confirmed HCoV-19 cases have been reported, with >11,000 severe cases and >2900

61

deaths in China. By the end of January confirmed HCoV-19 cases were present in all the

62

Chinese provinces and municipalities and at the time of writing the virus has been detected

63

in over 60 countries.

64
65

An epidemiological survey of several HCoV-19 cases at an early stage of the outbreak

66

revealed that most had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city prior to illness,

67

where various wild animals were on sale before it was closed on January 1, 2020 due to the

68

outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that HCoV-19 is a novel beta-CoV distinct from

69

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

70

identified from a Rhinolophus affinis bat sampled in Yunnan province in 2013 . This virus

71

shared 96.1% nucleotide identity and 92.9% identity in the S gene, again suggesting that bats

72

play a key role as coronavirus reservoirs . Notably, however, two research groups recently

73

reported several novel beta-CoVs related to HCoV-19 in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica)

74

that were illegally imported into Guangxi (GX) and Guangdong (GD) provinces, southern

75

China . Although these pangolins CoVs are more distant to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 across

76

the virus genome as a whole, they are very similar to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain

77

(RBD) of the S protein, including at the amino acid residues thought to mediate binding to

78

ACE2 . It is therefore possible that pangolins play an important role in the ecology and

79

evolution of CoVs, although whether they act as intermediate hosts for HCoV-19 is currently

80

unclear. Indeed, the discovery of viruses in pangolins suggests that there is a wide diversity

81

of CoVs still to be sampled in wildlife, some of which may be directly involved in the

82

emergence of HCoV-19.

. To date, the most closely related virus to HCoV-2019 is RaTG13,

84

Between May and October, 2019, we collected a total of 302 samples from 227 bats from

85

Mengla County, Yunnan Province in southern China (Extended Data Table 1). These bats

86

belonged to 20 different species, with the majority of samples from Rhinolophus malayanus

87

(n=48, 21.1%), Hipposideros larvatus (n=41, 18.1%) and Rhinolophus stheno (n=39, 17.2%). The

88

samples comprised multiple tissues, including patagium (n=219), lung (n=2) and liver (n=3),

89

and feces (n=78). All but three bats were sampled alive and subsequently released. Based on

90

the bat species primarily identified according to morphological criteria and confirmed

91

through DNA barcoding, the 224 tissues and 78 feces were merged into 38 and 18 pools,

92

respectively, with each pool including 1 to 11 samples of the same type (Extended Data Table

93

1). These pooled samples were then used for next generation sequencing (NGS).

94
95

Using next-generation metagenomic sequencing we successfully obtained 11954 and 64224

96

reads in pool No. 39 (from a total of 78,477,464 clean reads) that mapped to a SARS-like bat

97

coronavirus, Cp/Yunnan2011 (JX993988), and to HCoV-19. From this, we generated two

98

preliminary consensus sequences. Pool 39 comprised 11 feces from Rhinolophus malayanus

99

collected between May 6 and July 30, 2019. After a series of verification steps, including re-

100

mapping and Sanger sequencing (Extended Data Table 2 and Figures 1-3), one partial (23395

101

bp) and one complete (29671 bp) beta-CoV genome sequences were obtained and termed

102

BetaCoV/Rm/Yunnan/YN01/2019

103

(RmYN02), respectively. Notably, 20 positions in the RmYN02 genome displayed nucleotide

104

polymorphisms in the NGS data, although these did not include the S1/S2 cleavage site

105

(Extended Data Figure 3). Only a few reads in the remaining 55 pools could be mapped to

106

the reference CoV genomes. The sequence identity between RmYN01 and Cp/Yunnan2011

107

across the aligned regions was 96.9%, whereas that between RmYN01 and HCoV-19 was only

108

79.7% across the aligned regions and 70.4% in the spike gene.

109
110

In contrast, RmYN02 was closely related to HCoV-19, exhibiting 93.3% nucleotide sequence

111

identity, although it was less similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 (96.1%) across the genome as

112

a whole (Fig. 1a). RmYN02 and HCoV-19 were extremely similar (>96% sequence identity) in

113

most genomic regions (e.g. 1ab, 3a, E, 6, 7a, N and 10) (Fig. 1a). In particular, RmYN02 was

114

97.2% identical to HCoV-19 in the longest encoding gene region, 1ab (n=21285). However,

115

RmYN02 exhibited far lower sequence identity to HCoV-19 in the S gene (nucleotide 71.8%,

116

amino acid 72.9%), compared to 97.4% amino acid identity between RaTG13 and HCoV-19

117

(Fig. 1a). Strikingly, RmYN02 only possessed 62.4% amino acid identity to HCoV-19 in the RBD,

118

whereas the pangolin beta-CoV from Guangdong had amino acid identity of 97.4% , and was

119

the closest relative of HCoV-19 in this region. A similarity plot estimated using Simplot also

120

revealed that RmYN02 was more similar to HCoV-19 than RaTG13 in most genome regions

121

(Fig. 1b). Again, in the RBD, the pangolin/MP789/2019 virus shared the highest sequence

122

identity to HCoV-19 (Fig. 1c).

Results from both homology modelling , in vitro assays and resolved three-dimensional

125

structure of the S protein have revealed that like SARS-CoV, HCoV-19 could also use ACE2

126

as a cell receptor. We analyzed the RBD of RmYN02, RaTG13, and the two pangolin beta-

127

CoVs using homology modelling (Fig. 2a-2f and Extended Data Figure 4 for sequence

128

alignment). The amino acid deletions in RmYN02 RBD made two loops near the receptor

129

binding site that are shorter than those in HCoV-19 RBD (Fig. 2a and 2f). Importantly, the

130

conserved disulfide bond in the external subdomain of SARS-CoV (PDB: 2DD8) , HCoV-19

131

(PDB: 6LZG), RaTG13 (Fig. 2b), pangolin/MP789/2019 (Fig. 2c) and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017

132

(Fig. 2d) was missing in RmYN02 (Fig. 2f). We speculate that these deletions may cause

133

conformational variations and consequently reduce the binding of RmYN02 RBD with ACE2

134

or even cause non-binding. It is possible that the bat SARS-related CoVs with loop deletions,

135

including RmYN02, ZXC21 and ZC45, use a currently unknown receptor. In contrast, RaTG13

136

(Fig. 2b), pangolin/ MP789/2019 (Fig. 2c) and pangolin/P5L/2017 (Fig. 2d) did not have the

137

deletions, and had similar conformations at their external domains, indicating that they may

138

also use ACE2 as cell receptor although, with the exception of pangolin/MP789/2019 (see

139

below), all exhibited amino acid variation to HCoV-19. Indeed, the pangolin/MP789/2019

140

virus showed highly structural homology with HCoV-19 (Fig. 2e).

12

141
142

Six amino acid residues at the RBD (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501 and Y505) have been

143

reported to be major determinants of efficient receptor binding of HCoV-19 to ACE2 . As

144

noted above, and consistent with the homology modelling, pangolin/MP789/2019 possessed

145

the identical amino acid residues to HCoV-19 at all six positions . In contrast, both RaTG13,

146

RmYN02 and RmYN01 possessed the same amino acid residue as HCoV-19 at only one of

147

the six positions each (RaTG13, L455; RmYN02, Y505; RmYN01, Y505) (Fig. 2g), despite

148

RaTG13 being the closest relative in the spike protein. Such an evolutionary pattern is

149

indicative of a complex combination of recombination and natural selection .

151

The S protein of CoVs is functionally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2 in a similar manner

152

to the haemagglutinin (HA) protein of avian influenza viruses (AIVs). The insertion of polybasic

153

amino acids at the cleavage site in the HAs of some AIV subtypes is associated with enhanced

154

pathogenicity

155

junction of S1 and S2, not observed in other lineage B beta-CoVs

156

represents a poly-basic (furin) cleavage site, is unique to HCoV-19 and is present in all HCoV-

157

19 sequenced so far. The insertion of three residues, PAA, at the junction of S1 and S2 in

158

RmYN02 (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Figure 2) is therefore of major importance. Although the

159

inserted residues (and hence nucleotides) are not the same as those in RmYN02, and hence

160

are indicative of an independent insertion event, that they are presented in wildlife (bats)

161

strongly suggests that they are of natural origin and have likely acquired by recombination.

162

As such, these data are strongly suggestive of a natural zoonotic origin of HCoV-19.

16,17

. Notably, HCoV-19 is characterized by a four-amino-acid-insertion at the
18,19

. This insertion, which

163
164

We next performed a phylogenetic analysis of RmYN02, RaTG13, HCoV-19 and the pangolin

165

beta-CoVs. Consistent with a previous research , the pangolin beta-CoVs formed two well-

166

supported sub-lineages, representing animal seized by anti-smuggling authorities in Guangxi

167

(Pangolin-CoV/GX) and Guangdong (Pangolin-CoV/GD) provinces (Fig. 3a and Extended

168

Data Figure 5). However, whether pangolins are natural reservoirs for these viruses, or they

169

acquired these viruses independently from bats or other wildlife, requires further sampling .

170

More notable was that RmYN02 was the closest relative of HCoV-19 in most of the virus

171

genome, although these two viruses were still separated from each other by a relatively long

172

branch length (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Figure 5). In the spike gene tree, HCoV-19 clustered

173

with RaTG13 and was distant from RmYN02, suggesting that the latter virus has experienced

174

recombination in this gene (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Figure 6). In phylogeny of the RBD,

175

HCoV-19 was most closely related to pangolin-CoV/GD, with the bat viruses falling in more

176

divergent positions, again indicative of recombination (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figure 7).

177

Finally, phylogenetic analysis of the complete RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene,

178

which is often used in the phylogenetic analysis of RNA viruses, revealed that RmYN02,

179

RaTG13 and HCoV-19 formed a well-supported sub-cluster distinct from the pangolin viruses

180

(Fig. 3d and Extended Data Figure 8).

181
182

We confirmed the bat host of RmYN02, Rhinolophus malayanus, by analyzing the sequence

183

of the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene from the next generation sequencing data; this revealed 100%

184

sequence identity to a Rhinolophus malayanus isolate (GenBank accession MK900703). Both

185

Rhinolophus malayanus and Rhinolophus affinis are widely distributed in southwest China

186

and southeast Asia. Generally, they do not migrate over long distances and are highly

187

gregarious such that they are likely to live in the same caves, which might facilitate the

188

exchange of viruses between them and the occurrence of recombination. Notably, RaTG13

189

was identified from anal swabs and RmYN02 was identified from feces, which is a simple, but

190

feasible way for bats to spread the virus to other animals, especially species that can utilize

191

cave environments.

192
193

Based on the currently available data we propose that HCoV-19 likely originates from multiple

194

naturally occurring recombination events in wildlife. A virus from bats likely provides the

195

genetic backbone of HCoV-19, with further recombination events with bats and perhaps

196

other wildlife species resulting in the acquisition of the Spike protein, RBD and the polybasic

197

cleavage site. Similar recombination events have been also implicated in the origin of SARS-

198

CoV , although it is clear that a far wider sampling of wildlife will be required to reveal the

199

exact species involved and the exact series of recombination events.
