ABSTRACT
A one-step reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) test was developed for rapid screening (40
minutes) of the Spike N501Y and HV69-70del mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The test also
targets a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab as an internal control. The samples containing both the
N501Y and HV69-70del mutations are concluded as VOC-202012/01 positive. Samples suspected to be
positive for B.1.351 or P.1 are the N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative cases. Limit of detection (LOD)
of the kit for Orf1ab target is 500 copies/mL, while that of the N501, Y501 and HV69-70del targets are
5000 copies/mL. The developed assay was applied to 165 clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2 from 32
different lineages. The SARS-CoV-2 lineages were determined via the next-generation sequencing (NGS).
The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the NGS results that 19 samples were N501Y and HV6970del positive, 10 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 1 sample was N501Y negative
and HV69-70del positive, and 135 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. All the VOC-202012/01
positive samples were detected in people who have traveled from England to Turkey. The RT-qPCR test
and the Sanger sequencing was further applied to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples collected in
Jan2021 from the 81 different provinces of Turkey. The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the
Sanger sequencing results that 32 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 4 samples were
N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, 964 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. The
specificity of the 40 minutes RT-qPCR assay relative to the sequencing-based technologies is 100%. The
developed assay is an advantageous tool for timely and representative estimation of the N501Y positive
variants’ prevalence because it allows testing a much higher portion of the SARS-CoV-2 positives in much
lower time compared to the sequencing-based technologies.

INTRODUCTION
Increasing prevalence of the spike (S) N501Y mutation containing SARS-CoV-2 variants (Table 1) have
significantly raised the concerns about the higher transmission rate (1) and the escape from neutralizing
antibodies (2). VOC-202012/01 is correlated with a significant increase in the rate of COVID-19 infection in
the United Kingdom (3). VOC-202012/01 could be up to 70% more transmissible than previous variants
due to unusually large number of mutations in a single cluster, particularly in the S protein. A confirmed
case of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 with the second episode due to VOC-202012/01 was reported in the
UK (4).

The N501Y is of particular importance among the other mutations of VOC-202012/01 (3). Mutations in Cterminal domain (CTD) (aa 333-527) of the S protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) is most likely to
change receptor recognition properties of SARS-CoV-2 (6). N501Y sits in the receptor-binding motif and
has been identified as increasing binding affinity to human ACE2 (7, 8).
Spike HV69-70del mutation of VOC-202012/01 is in the N terminal domain (NTD), has been identified in
variants associated with immune escape in immunocompromised patients, and is responsible for a
“dropout” in the S gene PCR target in a three-target (N, ORF1ab, S) commercial assay (3). 77% of the
sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes containing HV69-70del is VOC-202012/01 (5). Therefore, screening only
HV69-70del will not be decisive in regions where the VOC-202012/01 prevalence is low. The co-presence
of N501Y and HV69-70del is a case only for VOC-202012/01 (5) and can be used for the monitoring
regardless of the variant’s prevalence. In addition, the N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative cases are
the possible candidates of infections with the variants 501Y.V2 or P.1 (Table 1).
In addition to the N501Y mutation, the 501Y.V2 and P.1 variants carry the S E484K and K417(T/N)
mutations in the CTD of RBD. 9 of the 25,895 available VOC-202012/01 genomes contain the E484K
mutation (5). Escape from neutralizing antibodies by the spike protein E484K variants was previously
reported using a recombinant chimeric SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus (2). Molecular dynamic simulations have
pointed out the possibility that the combination of E484K, K417N and N501Y mutations induces
conformational change greater than N501Y mutant alone (9, 10).
Because all SARS-CoV-2 variants containing the N501Y are important for epidemiology, the timely and
representative estimation of their prevalence by testing a much higher portion of the SARS-CoV-2 positives

in much lower time compared to the sequencing-based technologies is necessary. In this study, a one-step
reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) test was developed for rapid screening of the Spike
N501Y and HV69-70del mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RT-qPCR Assay Targeting SARS-CoV-2 Spike N501Y and HV69-70del Mutations
The assay consumables were produced as a ready-to-use kit by Bioeksen R&D Technologies Limited,
Turkey (Table 2). The N501Y detection with the kit is performed by comparing two different RT-qPCR
reactions prepared using the “N501 Oligo Mix” and the “Y501 Oligo Mix”. A conserved region of ORF1ab
is targeted in both reactions as an internal control. SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutation HV69-70del is also
targeted in both reactions to differentiate VOC-202012/01 from the other N501Y containing variants
(Table 1). The N501Y mutation detection is made by comparing the Cq value differences in the two
reactions. The “Y501 Oligo Mix” must amplify Spike-501-target better (with lower Cq values) than the
“N501 Oligo Mix” does to obtain the positive N501Y mutation result.

Regardless of the technology used for the nucleic acid (NA) extraction, the Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y
Mutation Detection Kit is applied to NA extracts previously shown to be RT-qPCR positive for SARS-CoV-2
with a threshold cycle (Cq) less than 32. Orf1ab target in the kit ensures that the NA extract kept its
integrity during its storage at the temperature recommended by manufacturer of the NA extraction kit.
The NA templates with Cq values more than 32 for the Orf1ab target may result in false-negative results
since the LOD of the Spike-501 targeted oligo sets are 10x worse than that of the Orf1ab target. The NA
extracts must be transferred in dry ice.
The qPCR instruments and their software validated with the Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation
Detection Kit is given in Table 4. The details of the reaction set-up and the qPCR program is given in Table
5. The recommended threshold level to calculate the number of threshold cycles (Cq) is 200 RFU for Insta
Q96® Plus and CFX96 Touch™ instruments. The threshold level is 0.05 for Roche LightCycler® 96. "Dynamic
Tube" should be active, "Slope Correct" should be passive, "Outlier Removal" should be "0", and the
threshold level should be set to 0.02 to calculate the Cq values in Rotor-Gene® Q. For BMS MIC qPCR,
"Non-Assay Green/Parameters/Fixed Length" options should be selected, auto-threshold setting should
be active.

The shape of the amplification curves should be examined. If a Cq value is assigned to a sample by the
instruments’ software and the curve is sigmoidal, the Cq value can be used in the final evaluation. Nonsigmoidal curves should be recorded as negative. If a Cq value is assigned to a sample, but
the curve is not sigmoidal, the result should be recorded as negative. On the web page
linked with the QR code, examples of the sigmoidal amplification curves are given. The
results obtained with the Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation Detection Kit should
not be interpreted without examining these samples.
If the IC does not perform as described in Table 6, repeat the analysis by increasing the reaction volume
to 50 µL by keeping the ratios of the reaction components in Table 5. If the problem continues, then
conclude as an invalid PCR template.
If the IC perform as described in Table 6, but there is no amplification in both the N501 and Y501 reactions,
repeat the analysis by decreasing the annealing temperature from 60 °C to 55 °C during the 40 cycles of
the amplification step (Table 5).

If all the controls are valid, proceed to the interpretation of the results. The “N501 Oligo Mix” targets a
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome region encoding the N amino acid at position 501 (FAM) of the S protein.
The “Y501 Oligo Mix” targets a VOC-202012/01 genome region encoding the Y amino acid at position 501
(FAM) of the S protein. There is a single nucleotide difference between the S-501-target of the N501 and
Y501 oligo mixes. Hence, the “Y501 Oligo Mix” must amplify Spike-501-target better (with
lower Cq values) than the “N501 Oligo Mix” does to obtain the positive N501Y mutation
result. The differentiation is made by calculating the Cq value difference between the FAM
and ROX channels for each reaction, and by comparing the Cq value differences in the two
reactions. Cq difference between Y501 (FAM) and Orf1ab (ROX) channels in “Y501 Oligo
Mix” reaction must be at least 1 Cq lower than that of the “N501 Oligo Mix” reaction to report N501Y
mutation positivity. HV6970del mutation is positive if there is a sigmoidal curve in the (CY5) channel and
the Cq is lower than 38. The calculation method is given below. On the web page linked with the QR code,
an excel document that allows the calculation by entering the Cq values is provided.
[Cq N501 in FAM] – [Cq N501 in ROX] = ΔCq N501; [Cq Y501 in FAM] – [Cq Y501 in ROX] = ΔCq Y501
ΔCq N501 - ΔCq Y501= ΔΔCq 501; N501Y positive if ΔΔCq 501 > 1; N501Y negative if ΔΔCq 501 ≤ 1

sequencing is needed
to confirm the E484K
and the K417(T/N)
coexistence.

Limit of detection (LOD)
LOD studies determine the lowest detectable concentration of the analyte at which greater or equal to
95% of all (true positive) replicates test positive. A pool of nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal swab
samples in Bio-Speedy® vNATTM Transfer Tube (Cat No: BS-NA-513) that were RT-qPCR negative for SARSCoV-2 were spiked with a cultured SARS-CoV-2 isolate given in Table 9. Because the vNATTM buffer lyses
SARS-CoV-2 and preserves RNA, the lysate in the vNATTM Transfer Tube was directly used in RT-qPCR
reactions.
The cultured virus was quantified in copies/mL by a molecular assay using 103-106 copies/mL dilutions of
synthetic SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene partial synthetic RNA (Oligo-X Biotechnology, Turkey). The acceptance
criteria for the dilution series to be used in the standard curves was r2>0.9, 1.9<fold-change per cycle<2.0
and percent coefficient of variation (CV%)<5.

Triplicates of the spiked samples with a final concentration of 104, 103, 102, 101, and 100 copies/mL were
tested using Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch™ to determine the minimum concentration that yielded positive results
in all the replicates. 20 replicates of 2- and 0.5-fold dilutions of the minimum concentration were tested
to determine the LOD. 20 replicates of the dilutions at the LOD were tested again using the qPCR
instruments in Table 4 other than Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch™.
Cross-reactivity
A pool of SARS-CoV-2 negative nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and nasal swab samples in the vNATTM
Transfer Tube was spiked with the reference strains and clinical isolates from the culture-confirmed cases.
Final concentration of 106 cfu/mL for bacteria and 105 copies/mL for viruses were tested for the cross
reactivity. Coronavirus 229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1, MERS, SARS CoV strain Frankfurt 1, Influenza A H1/H3,

nasal wash from 20 different people (healthy donors) were used for testing the exclusivity.
In silico tests were carried out using the BLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). The target region of the oligonucleotide sets was searched against the nucleotide sequence
database from which SARS-CoV-2 taxon was excluded.
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
The Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation Detection Kit was applied to 165 clinical samples containing
SARS-CoV-2 from 32 different lineages. The lineages were determined via the NGS. 133 SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences with the GISAID accession IDs between 428712-428723, 429861-429873, 811136811143, 812761-812781, 812873-812921, 814062-814091 were obtained in Illumina MiSeq and
assembled using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignerv.07.17-r1188 with 1,000x coverage. 32 SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences with the GISAID accession IDs between 437304 and 437335 were obtained in Oxford
Nanopore GridION and assembled using the Geneious Prime 2021.0.3 with 1,000x coverage.
Sanger Sequencing
The Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation Detection Kit and the Sanger sequencing was applied to
1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples collected in Jan2021 from the 81 different provinces of Turkey.
The PCR amplicons were obtained using the primer sets shown in Figure 2. The first round was one-step
RT-PCR using the 118-F and 1652-R primers that was followed by the nested PCRs using the 118F-695R
and 1157F-1652R primers. The Sanger sequencing was performed on Applied Biosystems 3130xl Genetic
Analyzer using the reading primers 118F, 641R, 1157F, 1420F and 1652R. The obtained sequences were
aligned with the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained via the NGS using the Clustal O tool of
the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For the LOD studies given in Table 10-13, the spiked samples were prepared based on the data given in
Table 9. The LOD of the Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation Detection Kit for Orf1ab target is 500
copies/mL, while that of the N501, Y501 and HV69-70del targets are 5000 copies/mL.
The melting temperature (Tm) of the sense primers targeting the mutations was kept low to increase the
effect of the sequence mismatches on the annealing. This resulted in 10x lower LOD and at least 3 cycles
lower Cq values of the mutation targets compared to those of the Orf1ab target. Hence, the developed
assay should be applied to NA extracts previously shown to be RT-qPCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a Cq
less than 32 to prevent negative results in the FAM channels of both the N501 and Y501 oligo mixes.
The developed RT-qPCR assay was negative for all strains used in the exclusion tests. The in-silico tests also
revealed that the oligonucleotide sets of the assay did not cross-react any nucleotide sequence in the
database.

The Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation Detection Kit was tested on 165 SARS-CoV-2 positive
samples from which the SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes were sequenced by the Ministry of Health Turkey
(Table 14). The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the whole genome sequence data. 19 of the
29 N501Y positive samples were VOC-202012/01 all detected in people who have traveled from England
to Turkey.

The Bio-Speedy® SARS-CoV-2 N501Y Mutation Detection Kit and the Sanger sequencing was applied to
1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples collected in Jan2021 from the 81 different provinces of Turkey.
The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the Sanger sequencing results (Table 15).

Increasing trend of the VOC-202012/01 prevalence is the indicator of its higher transmission rates. The
501Y.V2 and P.1 variants do not seem to have a higher transmission rate, but they are also alarming due
to their potential of causing more severe illness or escaping from the neutralizing antibodies. The
developed RT-qPCR assay allows detection of both VOC-202012/01 and the suspected cases of the 501Y.V2
and P.1 variants with considerably lower time and cost compared to the sequencing-based technologies.

The NGS is still the only way to detect emergence of a new and threatening SARS-CoV-2 variant, but the
RT-qPCR is the best tool to track prevalence of the new threat in a timely and representative manner.
Currently, VOC-202012/01 is spreading globally, like the SARS-CoV-2 variant with the D614G mutation
became dominant in the first quarter of 2020. (13). The UK experience taught us that if the VOC-202012/01
abundance is increasing even though its prevalence is low, a massive increase in the SARS-CoV-2 positive
cases would be expected in the future. Hence, entry of the VOC-202012/01 carriers should be prevented
at the country borders, filiation studies should be accelerated for the identified cases and more specific
quarantine conditions should be created. This is possible only by testing the highest portion of the positives
in the shortest time. The developed 40 minutes RT-qPCR assay allows this because the quantity of the
qPCR instruments has been increasing tremendously while its application cost is decreasing all around the
world.
