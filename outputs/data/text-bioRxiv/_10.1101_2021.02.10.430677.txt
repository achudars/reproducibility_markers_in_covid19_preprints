Abstract
The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5
(MDA5) are the major viral RNA sensors that are essential for activation of antiviral immune
responses. However, their roles in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-causing
coronavirus (CoV) infection are largely unknown. Herein we investigate their functions in
human epithelial cells, the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and the first line of host
defense. A deficiency in MDA5 (MDA5-/-), RIG-I or mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein
(MAVS) greatly enhanced viral replication. Expression of the type I/III interferons (IFN) was
upregulated following infection in wild-type cells, while this upregulation was severely
abolished in MDA5-/- and MAVS-/-, but not in RIG-I-/- cells. Of note, ACE2 expression was ~2.5
fold higher in RIG-I-/- than WT cells. These data demonstrate a dominant role of MDA5 in
activating the type I/III IFN response to SARS-CoV-2, and an IFN-independent anti-SARSCoV-2 role of RIG-I.

Introduction

Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses with the largest
genomes (~30kb) among the known RNA viruses 1. They are the major etiologies of fatal human
respiratory diseases, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-causing CoV and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV. SARS started in November 2002 in Southern
China, spread to 26 countries, and resulted in 8439 cases and 821 deaths2. Between its discovery
in 2012 and January 2020, MERS-CoV had caused 2519 cases and 866 deaths3. At the end of 2019,
a new SARS strain, SARS-CoV-2 that is 86% identical to SARS-CoV at the amino acid level,
emerged in humans in Central China, and now has spread worldwide. Currently, there are >108
million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 2.4 million deaths from ~200 countries4, constituting
the greatest global public health crisis in the 21st century. Its pathogenesis, though plausibly similar
to that of SARS-CoV, remains largely unknown – highlighting a critical need for new research in
this area.
When invaded by a virus, a host cell produces a rapid innate immune response initiated by
pathogen pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectins, Toll-like receptors (TLR),
retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLR), the cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)
synthase (cGAS), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLR)
etc. Once engaged by viral RNA, the cytoplasmic RLRs translocate and bind to a mitochondrion
transmembrane protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which ignites a
signaling event, leading to transcription of immune genes, in particular interferons (IFN) that
provide an instant protection to the host 5. The relative contribution of different classes of PRRs
to innate antiviral immune responses may vary with viral species and tissue cell types. The

cytoplasmic RLRs (RIG-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5, MDA5) are the
essential PRRs to control RNA virus infection, while they show differential preference to different
RNA viruses 6. MDA5 is essential for induction of the type I/III IFN response during mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, infection in mice 7,8; while both RIG-I and MDA5
contribute to the type I IFN response in oligodendrocytes during MHV infection 9. Little is known
about the differential role of RLRs in SARS-CoV infection, although they can be hijacked by
SARS-CoV proteins to evade host immune responses 10 11.

Results and discussion

We investigated the differential role of RIG-I and MDA5 in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection
and mounting immune responses in a human lung epithelial cell lines Calu-3. We generated
individual RIG-I, MDA5 and MAVS knockout using CRISPR-Cas9 and validated by
immunoblotting (Fig.1a). To prove that these gene function was precisely silenced, we infected
mutant cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV specifically activates RIG-I-MAVS) with an
green fluorescence protein (GFP) integrated into its genome. As expected, RIG-I-/- or MAVS-/- cells
presented a much higher VSV-GFP load than wild type (WT) cells, while MDA5-/- cells had a
similar viral load as WT (Fig.1b). These results demonstrate precise disruption of each gene
function of interest by CRSIPR-Cas9. We then compared SARS-CoV-2 infection and interferon
responses in these knockout cells in parallel. The intracellular viral RNA load was increased by
~2-3.5-fold in all knockout cells at 24hrs post infection (p.i.), by 5-12-fold at 72hrs p.i. (Fig.2a).
Consistently the extracellular viral titers were also much higher from all knockout cells than WT
(Fig.2b). We confirmed these observations in A549 cells (Fig.2c). Although primarily sensing

.

We noted a slight increase in SARS-CoV-2 load in STING-/- cells (Fig.2 d, e), suggesting that
STING signaling is largely dispensable.

We next examined antiviral immune responses. The IFNB1 (type I IFN) and IL29 (type III
IFN) mRNA levels were continuously upregulated during the course of infection in WT cells;
while this induction was impaired in MDA5-/- and MAVS-/-cells, though not completely abolished;
So was one of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG15) (Fig.3a). The concentrations of IFN-β and CX-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) proteins in the cell culture supernatants from MDA5-/and MAVS-/- were much lower than WT cells (Fig.3b). However, the type I/III IFN and ISG15

expression was higher in RIG-I-/- than WT cells (Fig.3a), suggesting that RIG-I interferes with
SARS-CoV-2 replication independently of IFNs. Of note, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2, a major cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2) mRNA expression was continuously
upregulated during the course of infection in WT cells, and it was ~2.5-fold higher in RIG-I-/- than
that in WT other knockout cells (Fig.3c), suggesting that RIG-I represses ACE2 mRNA expression.

Understanding the major PRR pathways in the respiratory tract epithelial cells is
physiologically meaningful as these cells are the primary and initial target of SARS-CoV-2, and
the first line of host defense. The RLR signaling is functional in all tissues and cell types, in
contrast to viral RNA-sensing TLRs (TLR3, TLR7) that are primarily limited to immune cells.
Thus, herein we only focused on RLRs in lung epithelial cells. Our results demonstrate that
MDA5 is the predominant RLR, because MDA5 deficiency led to a similar effect on viral
replication and type I/III IFNs as MAVS deletion did (Fig.2, 3). However, in neither MDA5 nor
MAVS knockout cells, induction of IFNs was completely abolished (Fig.3), suggesting that
other PRR signaling pathways may collectively play a role. Surprisingly, RIG-I deletion had no
negative impact on induction of IFN responses by SARS-CoV-2, but still increased viral
replication (Fig.2, 3), suggesting that RIG-I plays a MAVS-IFN-independent antiviral role. Of
note, ACE2 expression was upregulated by ~2.5 folds in RIG-I-/- , compared to WT and other
knockout cell even at 1hr post infection. This suggests RIG-I may restrict SARS-CoV-2 cellular
entry by repressing ACE2 mRNA expression. Alternatively, RIG‐I may exert broad antiviral
activity in the models that have defective IFN signaling14. RIG-I could induce expression of
antiviral effectors by an IFN-Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT)-independent mechanism 15. RIG-I could disrupt interaction of hepatitis B virus

polymerase with the 5'-ε region of viral pregenomic RNA in an RNA-binding dependent manner,
which consistently suppressed viral replication 16. RIG-I binding to the nucleocapsid of influenza
A virus could directly inhibit viral replication 17. Both MDA5 and RIG-I may displace viral
proteins pre-bound to dsRNA in a manner dependent on their ATP hydrolysis, thus exerting a
MAVS-IFN-independent broad-spectrum antiviral role (Sindbis, yellow fever, Coxsackie B,
Sendai, influenza A, and human parainfluenza 3 viruses) 18. During the submission of this
manuscript, a study showed an important anti-SARS-CoV-2 role of MDA5 that is consistent with
our results, however dispensable function of RIG-I in limiting SARS-CoV-2 infection19. This
discrepancy could be due to a difference in the cell line and gene knockout method.

In summary, we report a dominant role of MDA5 in sensing SARS-CoV-2 and activating
immune responses, and an IFN-independent anti-SARS-CoV-2 role of RIG-I. Given a
therapeutic potential of IFN in COVID-19 20 21 and the essential role of MDA5 in IFN induction,
the MDA5 agonists could thus be therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies, cells and viruses
The rabbit anti-MDA5 (Cat# 5321), RIG-I (Cat# 3743), and Actin (Cat# 8456) were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, United States). Mouse anti-human MAVS (Cat#
SC-365333) was a product of Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, United States). Human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T (Cat# CRL-3216), Vero cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells,
Cat# CCL-81), human lung epithelial A549 (Cat# CCL-185), human lung epithelial Calu-3 (Cat#
HTB-55) cell lines were from American Type Tissue Culture (Manassas, VA, United States).
SARS-CoV-2 (NR-52281, Isolate USA-WA1/2020) was provided by BEI Resources (funded by
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and managed by ATCC, United States). The
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) used in this study was Indiana strain, and the green fluorescence
protein (GFP) tagged VSV was provided by Dr. Rose at Yale University 22. These viruses were
propagated in Vero cells.

Cell culture and virus infection
HEK293T/Vero cells and Calu-3/A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
or Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640, respectively (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics/antimycotics. These
cell lines are not listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC,
and have not been authenticated in our hands. They were routinely treated with MycoZAP (Lonza)
to prevent mycoplasma contamination.
SARS-CoV-2/VSV-GFP was added to cells at a multiplicity of infectivity (MOI) of 0.5
respectively, and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1-2hrs. The viral inoculum was then removed

completely, and replaced by fresh culture medium. The cells and medium were collected
immediately (1hr or 2hrs as a baseline), or 24-72hrs after inoculation.

Gene knockout by CRISPR-Cas9
A gene specific guide RNA was cloned into lentiCRISPR-V2 vector and co-transfected into
HEK293T cells with the packaging plasmids pVSV-G and psPAX2. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, the lentiviral particles in the cell culture media were applied to A549 or Calu-3 cells
for 48 hours. The transduced cells were then selected with puromycin at 2μg/ml for 4-5 days until
non-transfected control cells completely died. The guide RNA for human RIG-I, MDA5 and

Plaque forming assay
Quantification of infectious viral particles in cell culture supernatant was performed on Vero cell
monolayer 25. Briefly, serial dilutions of supernatants was applied to confluent Vero cells (6-well
plate) at 37 °C for 2 h. The inoculum was then removed and replaced with 2 ml of DMEM complete
medium with 1% SeaPlaque agarose (Cat# 50100, Lonza). Plaques were visualized using Neutral
red (Sigma-Aldrich) after 3 days of incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2.

transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) was performed using the BIO-RAD
iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with gene-specific
primers and SYBR Green PCR master mix. Results were calculated using the –ΔΔCt method and
a housekeeping gene, beta actin, as an internal control. The qPCR primers and probes for immune
genes were reported in our previous studies24. The primers for SARS-CoV-2 were forward: 5’GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT-3’ and reverse: 5’-TCT GGT TAC TGC CAG TTG AAT
CTG-3’.

Multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
We used a LEGENDPlex (Biolegend, San Diego, CA 92121, USA) bead-based immunoassay to
quantify the cytokine concentrations in the cell culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells. The procedures were exactly the same as in the product manual. Briefly, the supernatants
or standards were mixed with antibody-coated microbeads in a filter-bottom microplate, and
incubated at room temperature for 2hrs with vigorous shaking at 500 rpm. After removal of
unbound analytes and two washes, 25 µL of detection antibodies were added to each well, and
the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1hr with vigorous shaking at 500 rpm. 25 µL of
SA-PE reagent was then added directly to each well, and the plate was incubated at room
temperature for 30min with vigorous shaking at 500 rpm. The beads were washed twice with
wash buffer, and then transferred to a microfuge tube. The beads were fixed with 4% PFA for
15min and resuspended in FACS buffer. The beads were run through a BIORAD ZE5 and the
concentrations of analytes were calculated with the standards included using the LEGENDPlex
software.
