Abstract
A subset of patients with COVID-19 become critically ill, suffering from severe respiratory
problems and also increased rates of thrombosis. The causes of thrombosis in severely ill
COVID-19 patients are still emerging, but the coincidence of critical illness with the timing of
the onset of adaptive immunity could implicate an excessive immune response. We
hypothesised that platelets might be susceptible to activation by anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibodies and contribute to thrombosis. We found that immune complexes containing
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-spike IgG enhanced platelet-mediated
thrombosis on von Willebrand Factor in vitro, but only when the glycosylation state of the Fc
domain was modified to correspond with the aberrant glycosylation previously identified in
patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we found that activation was dependent on
FcγRIIA and we provide in vitro evidence that this pathogenic platelet activation can be
counteracted by therapeutic small molecules R406 (fostamatinib) and ibrutinib that inhibit
tyrosine kinases syk and btk respectively or by the P2Y12 antagonist cangrelor.
Introduction
COVID-19 is more likely to progress to a severe, life threatening condition in patients with
pre-existing cardiovascular disease and is associated with dysregulated haemostasis and a
high incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism [1-3]. Emboli in the pulmonary
arteries and microthrombi containing fibrin and platelets in the pulmonary microvasculature
of COVID-19 patients have been identified at post-mortem [4] and are thought to contribute
toward development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is now believed that
multiple factors contribute to the thromboinflammatory state that results in high rates of
thrombotic complications. Evidence has indicated the presence of activated vascular
endothelial cells, macrophages, platelets, neutrophils and an activated coagulation system in
critically ill COVID-19 patients. The mechanistic trigger that causes the changes that
accompany an increase in severity in a subset of patients is still the subject of intense
research. However, the disparity between the time of peak viral load at 5-6 days after the

onset of symptoms and occurrence of ARDS after 8-9 days, implicate an excessive immune
response rather than direct actions of the virus itself [5].
Further evidence that the adaptive immune response is disturbed in severely ill COVID-19
patients has been provided by a study that found high levels of extrafollicular B cell
activation in critically ill patients which correlates with increased morbidity, antibody titres
and levels of inflammatory biomarkers [6]. Other studies have also noted the strong
association of high antibody titres with disease severity and survival [7, 8]. However,
antibodies of severely ill COVID-19 patients have qualitative as well as quantitative
differences compared to those with mild illness. Anti-spike IgG in serum samples from
severely ill COVID-19 patients were found to have low levels of fucosylatation and elevated
galactosylation in the Fc domain [9, 10].
Platelets express the antibody receptor FcγRIIA, but it is not known if immune complexes
containing afucosylated IgG might activate platelet FcγRIIA. Clustering of platelet FcγRIIA
induced by ligand binding triggers intracellular signalling via syk activation and promotes
granule secretion and integrin αIIBβ3 activation [11]. Therefore, activation of FcγRIIA by
afucosylated anti SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG might further exacerbate thromboinflammation in
critically ill COVID-19 patients.
In this study we investigate the effects of low fucosylation and high galactosylation of antispike IgG on platelet activation to find the significance of aberrant IgG glycosylation
identified in critically-ill COVID-19 patients on platelet-mediated thrombus formation. We
found that potent activation of platelets by immune complexes containing SARS-CoV-2 spike
and anti-spike IgG only occurs when the IgG expresses both low fucosylation and high
galactosylation in the Fc domain and an additional prothrombotic signal, we used vWF, is
also present. Enhanced platelet activation and thrombosis, measure in vitro, was sensitive to
FcγRIIA inhibition and small molecules inhibitors of syk, btk and P2Y12, suggesting that
these therapeutic strategies might reduce platelet-mediated thrombosis in critically-ill
COVID-19 patients.

Materials and Methods
Spike protein
The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S1 was obtained from the cloned full-length S sequence and
was cloned into the expression vector pTriEx1.1 (EMD Millipore, UK) and characterised as
described previously [12]. Sf9 cells were transfected with the baculovirus expression vector
FlashBAC Gold (Oxford Expression Technologies, UK) and with the SARS-CoV2-S1 transfer
vector to produce recombinant baculovirus. Large-scale protein expression was performed
by infecting 1L of T.nao38 cells with a high titre stock of the recombinant baculovirus and
incubated for 3-5 days at 27°C. After incubation the supernatant containing the secreted
protein was harvested, clarified by centrifugation at 4,300xg for 20min and filtered through a
0.45μm filter. The clear supernatant was supplemented with 0.5nM nickel sulphate before
being loaded onto the Bio-Scale Mini Profinity IMAC Cartridge (Bio-Rad, UK). The elution
was carried out at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min with a gradient elution of 0.05-0.25M imidazole
over 60 min.
Recombinant anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG
COVA1-18 IgG was produced in 293F cells as described previously [13]. Antibodies with
modified glycosylation states were generated and validated as previously described [14].
Validation of the modifications made to COVA1-18 glycosylation are included in table 1.
Blood Preparation
Blood samples were obtained from healthy donors that had given informed consent and
using procedures approved by the University of Reading Research Ethics Committee and
collected into vacutainers containing 3.8% (w/v) sodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
was prepared by centrifuging whole blood at 100g for 20 minutes. Washed platelets were
prepared by adding acid citrate dextrose to PRP and centrifuging at 350g for 20 minutes and
resuspending the platelet pellet at 4 × 108 cells/mL in Tyrode’s buffer (NaCl 134 mM, KCl

2.68 mM, CaCl2 1.80 mM, MgCl2 1.05 mM, NaH2PO4 417 μM, NaHCO3 11.9 mM, Glucose
5.56 mM, pH 7.4).
Platelet adhesion assay
Glass 8 well microslides (Ibidi, Munich, Germany) were coated with 5μg/ml recombinant
SARS-COV-2 spike protein for 60 minutes at 37oC, washed and then blocked with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) for 1h at 37oC. The slides were then washed and treated with 10μg/ml
COVA1-18 recombinant, monoclonal anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies (see above) for 1h at
37oC. Washed platelets at 2 × 107 cells/mL were incubated on the slides for 1h at 37oC.
Non-adherent platelets were washed off with Tyrode’s buffer and then slides were fixed with
10% formyl saline for 10 minutes. Wells were then washed and the platelets were labelled
with 2μM DiOC6. Fluorescence images of adherent platelets were captured with the 20×
objective lens of a confocal Ti2 microscope (Nikon).
In vitro thrombus formation
Thrombus formation experiments were performed using microfluidic flow chips (Vena8,
CellixLtd, Dublin, Ireland) coated with 5μg/ml recombinant SARS-COV-2 spike protein for 60
minutes at 37oC, washed and then blocked with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 1h at 37oC.
The slides were then washed and treated with 10μg/ml COVA1-18 recombinant, monoclonal
anti-SARS-COV-2 antibodies (see above) for 1h at 37oC and then 2U/ml vWF for 1h.
Thrombus formation was measured by perfusing citrated whole blood through the flow
chambers at 1000s-1 for 6 minutes before fixing with 10% formyl saline, staining with 2μM
DiOC6 and then imaged by acquiring z-stacks using the 20× objective lens of a confocal Ti2
fluorescence microscope (Nikon).
Light transmission aggregometry
Aggregation was measured in washed platelets in half-area 96-well plates (Greiner) by
shaking at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 37°C using a plate shaker (Quantifoil Instruments) after

stimulating with collagen at a range of concentrations. Changes in light transmittance of 405
nm was measured using a FlexStation 3 plate reader (Molecular Devices).
Flow cytometry measurement of fibrinogen binding
Measurements of fibrinogen binding were performed using washed platelets pretreated with
immune complexes, created by incubating 5μg/ml recombinant SARS-COV-2 spike protein
with 10μg/ml COVA1-18 for 60 minutes at 37oC, and then stimulated with 1 µg/mL CRP,
10μM ADP or 1μM TRAP-6 in the presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated
polyclonal rabbit anti-fibrinogen antibody (Agilent Technologies LDA UK Limited, Cheadle,
United Kingdom), and then incubated for 20 minutes in the dark. Platelets were then fixed by
addition of filtered formyl saline (0.2% formaldehyde in 0.15M NaCl) and median
fluorescence intensities were measured for 5000 platelets per sample on an Accuri C6 Flow
Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Berkshire, United Kingdom).
Statistical methods
Statistical testing as described in figure legends and the results section were performed
using GraphPad Prism Software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).
Results
Aberrant glycosylation of anti-spike IgG enhances in vitro thrombus formation on vWF
Previous studies have found a correlation between the severity of COVID-19 and the
glycosylation state of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, with low levels of fucosylation and high levels of
galactosylation present predominantly in patients with critical illness [9, 10, 14]. To
investigate whether anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with aberrant glycosylation activate
platelets, and assess the importance of low focusylation and high galactosylation, we studied
adhesion and spreading on coverslips coated with IgG-Spike immune complexes containing
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and COVA1-18 antibody. Four subtypes of COVA118 with different glycosylation states were used in the study; IgG with normal levels of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.437014; this version posted March 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

fucosylation and galactosylation (WT), a low fucose IgG (Low Fuc), a high galactose IgG
(High Gal) and IgG with both low fucose and high galactose (Low Fuc High Gal). We
compared the number of platelets adhered to the four different immune complexes relative to
spike protein alone and found no significant difference (Figure 1Ai-ii). Levels of platelet
adhesion to spike were not significantly greater than adhesion to FCS which was used as a
negative control. Adhesive platelet ligands collagen and cross-linked collagen related
peptide (CRP-XL) were included as a positive controls. These results indicated that the
immune complexes, regardless of the glycosylation state of the anti-spike IgG, were poor
ligands for platelet adhesion.
Severe COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of many prothrombotic plasma
proteins including von Willebrand Factor (vWF), which has been noted as up to five fold
higher (to approx. 5U/ml) in COVID-19 patients in intensive care [15-17]. We combined the
immune complex coatings with vWF at 2U/ml to simulate a modest increase in plasma vWF
levels. The combined immune complex and vWF coating resulted in significantly more
platelet adhesion to the Low Fuc High Gal IgG than the WT IgG (Figure 1Bi-ii). Adhesion to
IgG with either Low Fuc or High Gal was not significantly different to the WT IgG. This
suggested that both hypofucosylation and hypergalactosylation are required for platelet
activation by anti-spike IgG immune complexes and that prothrombotic conditions in the
circulation of severely ill COVID-19 patients, coupled with dysregulation of IgG glycosylation
may result in increased platelet activation.
The increase in platelet adhesion to IgG-spike immune complex and vWF-coated surfaces
was modest under static conditions, however, vWF facilitates platelet adhesion to the
vascular endothelium in the high shear environment found in arteries and arterioles. To
replicate these conditions, we performed thrombus formation experiments in perfusion
chambers coated with IgG-spike immune complexes and vWF at a shear rate of 1000s-1
(Figure 1Ci-ii). Under these conditions there was no significant difference in the average
volume of thrombi formed on vWF combined with Low Fuc or High Gal IgG relative to WT

IgG. However, there was a significant increase in thrombus volume formed on vWF in the
presence of Low Fuc High Gal IgG immune complexes. This suggests that anti SARS-CoV-2
IgG with aberrant glycosylation of the Fc domain synergises with vWF to enhance thrombus
formation. This replicates the synergy observed between platelet receptors that
predominantly mediate adhesion, such as GPIb and integrin α2β1, with receptors that
strongly activate platelet signalling such as GPVI and CLEC-2 [18].
FcγRIIA is the only Fc receptor expressed in platelets and activates intracellular signalling
via Syk activation [19]. We hypothesised FcγRIIA may play the role of a signalling receptor
to synergise with the vWF adhesion receptor GPIb to enhance thrombus formation. To test
this, whole blood was preincubated with FcγRIIA blocking antibody IV.3 before perfusion
through vWF-coated flow chambers with either WT or Low Fuc High Gal immune complexes
(Figure 1Di-ii). Blockade of FcγRIIA resulted in a significant reduction in the volume of
thrombi formed on the Low Fuc High Gal IgG-containing immune complexes.
Immune complexes presented in suspension do not potently enhance platelet activation
Platelet aggregability is enhanced in patients with severe COVID19 [20] and we
hypothesised that this might be due to the presence of immune complexes containing antispike IgG with aberrant glycosylation of the IgG Fc domain. To test this hypothesis we
preincubated recombinant SARS-COV-2 spike protein with the same four COVA1-18 IgG
variants used in previous experiments to enable formation of immune complexes in
suspension. We then treated washed human platelets with the immune complexes and
stimulated with a range of collagen (type I) concentrations to induce aggregation (Figure 2A).
We found that none of the immune complexes enhanced the potency (EC50) of collagenevoked aggregation (Figure 2B) or caused aggregation on their own. We also assessed the
ability of the immune complexes to potentiate activation of integrin αIIBβ3 by measuring
fibrinogen binding stimulated with ADP, TRAP-6 or CRP-XL by flow cytometry (Figure 2Ciiii). We observed no significant difference between integrin activation stimulated by agonists
in the presence of spike protein alone or immune complexes containing both spike and IgG.

These data suggest that the manner of presentation of immune complexes may be an
important part of the mechanism by which they activate platelets. Clustering of FcγRIIA
induces intracellular signalling in platelets [19] and it is possible that immune complexes
presented in suspension, rather than immobilised on a surface, are below the concentration
threshold required to cause clustering of the receptor. Infected endothelial cells may present
immobilised immune complexes to platelets in the circulation during severe COVID-19
infection.
Small molecules drugs targeting syk, btk and P2Y12 inhibit IgG-induced potentiation of
thrombus formation on vWF in vitro
To understand the signalling processes underpinning the enhancement of thrombus
formation on vWF and Low Fuc High Gal IgG and identify potential treatment strategies to
counteract pathogenic platelet activation we studied the effects of small molecule inhibitors
(Figure 3). FcγRIIA signals through the tyrosine kinase Syk, so we treated whole blood with
the Syk inhibitor R406 which is the active metabolite of the FDA-approved drug fostamatinib.
Treatment with R406 significantly reduced the volume of thrombi formed on Low Fuc High
Gal IgG (373k ± 42k μm3) relative to vehicle (820k ± 172k μm3), indicating that activation of
Syk is important to the prothrombotic effects of aberrantly glycosylated anti-SARs-CoV-2 IgG
and that treatment with fostamatinib might be beneficial for patients with severe COVID19
through suppression of IgG-driven platelet activation. FcγRIIA signals via PLCγ2 [21] and we
hypothesised that, similar to that stimulated by the platelet GPVI receptor [22-24], the
pathway involved might be dependent on Btk. We therefore treated platelets with the Btk
inhibitor ibrutinib, which is an FDA and EMA approved drug for treatment of B cell cancers.
We found that ibrutinib treatment reduced the volume of thrombi formed on the Low Fuc
High Gal IgG (348k ± 68k μm3) to levels similar to the WT IgG (478k ± 76k μm3). Finally,
platelet activation via FcγRIIA is dependent on ADP secreted dense granules to activate the
P2Y12 receptor and provide the positive feedback signalling required for integrin αIIBβ3
activation and aggregation [25]. Blood samples treated with the P2Y12 antagonist cangrelor,

were found to reduce the volume of the thrombi formed on Low Fuc High Gal IgG (389k ±
40k μm3) to comparable levels to those observed with WT IgG.
Discussion
There is a growing body of evidence that multiple complications arise in severely ill COVID19 patients that increase rates of thrombosis. These include damage to vascular endothelial
cells following direct infection with SARS-CoV-2, resulting in disruption of barrier function,
exposure of subendothelial collagen as well as release of prothrombotic plasma proteins
including vWF from activated endothelial cells [16]. The prothrombotic environment is
exacerbated by a cytokine storm that may be driven by activation of macrophages by
immune complexes containing afucosylated anti-spike IgG [9]. Hypofucosylated,
hypergalactosylated IgG has been identified in the plasma of severely ill COVID-19 patients
relative to patients with mild COVID-19 infection and correlated with disease severity [9, 14].
In the present study we showed that recombinant anti-spike IgG with low levels of
fucosylation and high levels of galactosylation activate platelets to enhance thrombus
formation on vWF, which is also elevated in severely ill COVID-19 patients [15-17].
We hypothesise that immune complexes present in the pulmonary circulation of severely ill
patients might activate platelets and contribute to high rates of thrombosis (Figure 4). A
similar mechanism has been identified in severe H1N1 infection, whereby immune
complexes present in the lungs activate platelets via FcγRIIA [26]. The role of aberrant IgG
glycosylation in stimulating this response was not investigated, but it has been suggested
that afucosylated IgG may be common to immune responses against all enveloped viruses
[9].
The role of platelets in COVID-19 is still emerging but platelet rich thrombi have been
identified in both large arteries and microthrombi [4]. Platelets contain many inflammatory
mediators within granules that might contribute toward the flood of cytokines present in
critically ill COVID-19 patients. There is still scant information regarding the efficacy of

antiplatelet drugs in COVID-19 patients but one study has suggested that patients receiving
antiplatelet therapy with aspirin prior to hospital admission for COVID-19 appear to be
partially protected and have better outcomes, while a separate study found that in-hospital
treatment of patients with aspirin reduced mortality [27, 28]. Other non-antiplatelet drugs in
trials for COVID-19 therapy have well documented antiplatelet effects. The Bruton’s tyrosine
kinase (Btk) inhibitor acalabrutinib has been evaluated in clinical trials on the basis of its
potential to block macrophage activation [29], however, the potential of Btk inhibitors to
reduce the contribution of platelets to thrombosis in COVID-19 infection have also been
noted [30]. We found that the btk inhibitor ibrutinib reversed the enhancement of thrombus
formation on vWF caused by IgG with low fucosylation and high galactosylation, supporting
the hypothesis that this strategy might have dual benefits on macrophage and platelet
activation. The syk inhibitor fostamatinib was identified as a potential COVID-19 therapeutic
in a high content screen of drugs that might protect against acute lung injury [31] . The active
metabolite of fostamatinib, R406 inhibits release of neutrophil extracellular NETS [32] and
macrophage activation induced by plasma from COVID-19 patients [14]. R406 is also known
to have potent antiplatelet effects downstream of the GPVI and CLEC-2 receptors [33] and is
currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 therapy in the US (NCT04579393) and UK
(NCT04581954). We found that R406 reversed the potentiation of thrombus formation

on vWF. This suggests that potential COVID-19 therapies such as fostamatinib or
acalabrutinib, targeting syk or btk respectively, may be effective not only in limiting the
inflammatory response, but also in reducing platelet-mediated thrombosis.

Figure 1. Low fucosylation and high galactosylation of the IgG F tail enhances
adhesion to von Willebrand Factor. Platelet adhesion to slides coated with immune
complexes containing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and COVA1-18 recombinant
anti-spike IgG with modified glyocosylation. (Ai) Numbers of platelets adhered to glass slides
coated with FCS (negative control), spike protein only or spike protein plus unmodified IgG
(WT) or IgG modified to have low fucosylation (low fuc), high galactosylation (high gal) or
both (low fuc high gal) and (Aii) representative images of adhered platelets stained with
DiOC6. (Bi) Numbers of platelets adhered to vWF plus immune complexes containing spike
protein and modified IgGs and (Bii) representative images of adhered platelets. (Ci) Volume
of thrombi formed on vWF with immune complexes containing spike and either WT IgG or
IgG with modified glyosylation and (Cii) representative images of thrombi stained with
DiOC6. (Di) Volume of thrombi formed on vWF plus WT IgG or IgG with low fucosylation and
high galactosylation in the presence or absence of 20μg/ml IV.3 and (Dii) representative
images of thrombi stained with DiOC6. Values are mean ± s.e.m. Significant differences
were tested by 2-way ANOVA with the Tukey multiple comparisons test, * p < 0.05, ** p <
0.01.

immune complexes. (Ai) Concentration response curves plotting platelet aggregation
following stimulation with a range of type I collagen concentrations (from 10μg/ml to
10ng/ml) in the presence of immune complexes containing spike plus WT IgG or IgG with
modified glycosylation and (Bi) scatter plots of logEC50 for collagen in the presence of the
different treatments. Fibrinogen binding to platelets measured by flow cytometry following
stimulation with (Ci) 10μM ADP, (Cii) 1μg/ml CRP-XL, (Ciii) 1μM TRAP-6 in the presence of
spike only or immune complexes containing WT IgG or IgG with modified gycosylation.
Significant differences were tested by 2-way ANOVA with the Tukey multiple comparisons
test.
Figure 3. Prothrombotic activity of low fucose, high galactose IgG1 immune
complexes is inhibited by Syk, Btk or P2Y12 inhibition. (A) Volume of thrombi formed in
perfusion chambers on vWF plus immune complexes containing spike protein plus either WT
IgG or IgG modified to have low fucosylation and high galactosylation following treatment
with vehicle (DMSO), 1μM R406, 1μm ibrutinib or 1μM cangrelor and (B) representative
images of thrombi stained with DiOC6. Values are mean ± s.e.m. Significant differences
were tested by 2-way ANOVA with the Tukey multiple comparisons test, * p < 0.05, ** p <

Figure 4. Aberrant glycosylation of anti-spike IgG in immune complexes act in concert
with VWF to enhance platelet thrombus formation. SARS-CoV-2 infects vascular
endothelial cells, and combined with other inflammatory signals, results in endothelial
activation and release of pro-thrombotic factors including VWF. After the onset of adaptive
immunity, anti-spike IgG accumulates in the circulation and binds to SARS-CoV-2. In
critically ill COVID-19 patients, anti-spike IgG has abnormally low levels of fucosylation and
high levels of galactosylation. Immune complexes containing this aberrant glycosylation
pattern activate platelet FcγRIIA which stimulate intracellular signals that synergise with the
adhesive ligand vWF to promote platelet activation and thrombus formation. Schematic was
created with BioRender.com.
