Abstract

Among the biomedical efforts in response to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,
pharmacological strategies to reduce viral load in patients with severe forms of the disease are
being studied intensively. One of the main drug target proteins proposed so far is the SARSCoV-2 viral protease 3CLpro (also called Mpro), an essential component for viral replication.
Ongoing ligand- and receptor-based computational screening efforts would be facilitated by an
improved understanding of the electrostatic, hydrophobic and steric features that characterize
small molecule inhibitors binding stably to 3CLpro, as well as by an extended collection of
known binders.
Here, we present combined virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulation, machine learning
and in vitro experimental validation analyses which have led to the identification of small
molecule inhibitors of 3CLpro with micromolar activity, and to a pharmacophore model that
describes functional chemical groups associated with the molecular recognition of ligands by
the 3CLpro binding pocket. Experimentally validated inhibitors using a ligand activity assay
include natural compounds with available prior knowledge on safety and bioavailability

properties, such as the natural compound rottlerin (IC50 = 37 µM), and synthetic compounds
previously not characterized (e.g. compound CID 46897844, IC50 = 31 µM). In combination with
the developed pharmacophore model, these and other confirmed 3CLpro inhibitors may
provide a basis for further similarity-based screening in independent compound databases and
structural design optimization efforts, to identify 3CLpro ligands with improved potency and
selectivity.
Overall, this study suggests that the integration of virtual screening, molecular dynamics
simulations and machine learning can facilitate 3CLpro-targeted small molecule screening
investigations. Different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning-based screening strategies
provided complementary information, helping to increase the number and diversity of identified
active compounds. Finally, the resulting pharmacophore model and experimentally validated
small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro provide resources to support follow-up computational
screening efforts for this drug target.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents a major challenge for health care
systems around the world. Patients experience highly heterogeneous symptoms,
ranging from asymptomatic forms and mild symptoms of a respiratory infection to
severe illness, which can lead to hospitalization and death.
While the first vaccines against COVID-19 have received Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and mass vaccination campaigns are
currently ongoing, the available drug-based treatments for the disease are still limited.
In the RECOVERY trial, a randomized trial designed to provide a fast and robust
assessment of potential treatments for COVID-19, the corticosteroid dexamethasone
was associated with a reduced mortality for patients with severe forms of the disease,
when using a moderate dose (6 mg daily for 10 days) [1]. The FDA has included
dexamethasone in their list of drugs used for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has endorsed the use of dexamethasone in
patients from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kg, who require
supplemental oxygen therapy. Moreover, the drug remdesivir, which inhibits the viral
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp), was approved by the FDA for the treatment
of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Remdesivir provided a statistically significant
shorter median time to recovery in the clinical trial ACTT-1 [2], and significant
symptom improvements vs. the standard of care in the GS-US-540-5774 trial [3], but
no statistically significant improvements were observed for overall 29-day mortality in
the ACTT-1 trial. In the independent SOLIDARITY trial no significant benefits were
found in terms of reduced mortality, reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization

duration [4]. Other potential treatment options against COVID-19 studied in clinical
trials, such as tocilizumab [5], colchicine [6], synthetic neutralizing antibodies [7], or
convalescent plasma [8], among others, were at the time of writing still under
investigation. Overall, while first significant successes in COVID-19 treatment have
been achieved using pharmacological methods, there is a broad consensus that
additional primary or adjuvant treatment approaches are required to further reduce
mortality and hospitalization rates.
For the development of new drug therapies against COVID-19 both human and viral
protein drug targets have been proposed. Suggested human drug targets include in
particular proteins involved in mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, such as
the proteases TMPRSS2 and FURIN, which have been implicated in the proteolytic
processing of the viral spike protein before cell entry [9,10]. The viral targets mainly
include proteins involved viral replication (3CLpro / Nsp5 [11], PLpro / Nsp3 [12], RdRp
/ Nsp12 [13], Hel / Nsp13 [14]), and proteins associated with viral cell entry (S1, S2
[15]) and release (ORF3a [16,17]).
One of the viral targets of particular interest is the 3C-like protease (3CLPro, Mpro),
which is needed by SARS-CoV-2 for the cleavage of viral polyproteins into 11 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) that are essential for viral replication [11]. Apart from its
critical role in replication, 3CLPro may also represent a well-suited target for drug
development, because multiple crystal structures are available with high resolution (<
1.3 Å) and favorable quality characteristics, and first small molecule inhibitors for both
the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV forms of the protein have already been identified
[18,19]. While these inhibitors still have limitations in terms of either their binding
affinity for the target protein, their bioavailability, adverse drug effects or high

manufacturing costs, the existing structural data for 3CLPro provides ample
opportunities to apply both receptor- and ligand-based computational screening
approaches in order to identify more potent and selective inhibitors.
To contribute to the ongoing research efforts on identifying improved 3CLPro
inhibitors, here we present the results of a combined computational and experimental
screening and pharmacophore generation approach. By integrating multiple
computational approaches for molecular docking, ligand-based screening, machine
learning and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we have ranked small molecule
compounds from the public libraries provided by the repositories ZINC [20],
SWEETLEAD [21] and the company MolPort (www.molport.com) as candidate
inhibitors for 3CLPro. Top-ranked compounds and a few (reference) molecules
previously proposed as 3CLpro inhibitors in the literature were experimentally
assessed using a ligand activity assay to identify a subset of inhibitors and their IC50
values. Depending on the size of the compound libraries, we tested different virtual
screening methodologies, thus also comparing the utility of different strategies for
inhibitor discovery. Finally, the validated inhibitors, which include both natural
compounds with existing information on ADMETox characteristics, as well as
previously uncharacterized synthetic compounds, were used to generate a
pharmacophore model (i.e. a computational model that describes the steric and
chemical features of compounds associated with the binding to the target protein).
The information derived from this model and the confirmed inhibitors provide a
resource to facilitate follow-up efforts on the structural design of more potent and
selective 3CLpro inhibitors or the similarity-based inhibitor screening in additional
compound databases.

In the following sections, we first present the computational and experimental
methods used for screening and compound validation, the results of the screening
procedure in terms of the characteristics of the validated inhibitors, and finally a
discussion of the pharmacophore model generated from the analysis of these
confirmed inhibitors.

METHODS
In order to identify and characterize small molecule inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
and build a pharmacophore model, a multi-step computational screening procedure
was combined with subsequent ligand activity assay experiments. The main
component of the computational screening consisted of a filtering procedure involving
multiple receptor- and ligand-screening approaches in combination with a final
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to confirm the stability of the binding for the topranked compounds and docking poses. An overview of this part of the screening
approach is shown in Figure 1, the detailed methodology, including the prior
preprocessing of protein and compound structures, is discussed in the following
sections below. Additionally, as part of the in silico selection of candidate compounds
for experimental validation, the structural bioinformatics based screening was
complemented by a machine learning approach for compound selection, using a
training set of molecular descriptor data derived from known binders and non-binders
for 3CLPro. This complementary screening approach is presented in detail in the
section ‘Machine learning based compound screening’ below.

The compounds prioritized using these in silico screening methods were then
evaluated experimentally to determine the subset of stable binders and their 3CLpro
inhibitory activity, using an in vitro Förster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET)
assay. These experimental analyses are described in more detail in the section ‘in vitro
assay for 3CLpro inhibitory activity assessment’.

Figure 1. Overview of overall workflow for the screening procedure, starting with a compound library
of > 1 billion compounds from the databases ZINC, SWEETLEAD and the MolPort. Due to the large size
of the ZINC database, this compound repository was pre-filtered to focus on compounds that are
commercially available and have drug-like chemical and ADMETox properties, and receptor-based
screening was only applied after prior ligand-based screening (see section on ‘Ligand pre-processing
and filtering’). More computationally expensive approaches relying only on receptor-based screening

were only applied to the smaller SWEETLEAD and MolPort libraries, and machine learning based
compound screening was only applied to the MolPort library (see sections on ‘Receptor-based
screening using molecular docking’ and ‘Machine learning based compound screening’). A final
selection of 95 top-ranked compounds derived from the in silico screening approaches was tested
experimentally using a FRET assay to assess the 3CLpro inhibitory activity. Confirmed active compounds
were characterized in terms of their known or computationally estimated ADMETox and bioavailability
properties. Finally, pharmacophore models were generated for the active compounds.

COMPUTATIONAL METHODS
Protein structure pre-processing
Three publicly available protein crystal structures for 3CLPro from the Protein Data
Bank [22] were chosen for the molecular docking analyses and binding affinity
estimation (PDB: 5R8T, 6YB7 and 6LU7). The structures 5R8T and 6YB7 were selected
mainly due to their resolution (5R8T: 1.27 Å, 6YB7: 1.25 Å) and quality (R-free value:
0.208 for 5R8T and 0.192 for 6YB7), see additional quality assessments described
below), whereas the structure 6LU7 was used additionally as a representation of the
holo form of protein in complex with an inhibitor, enabling a delineation of the binding
pocket (resolution: 2.16 Å, R-free value: 0.235).
The receptor structures were pre-processed using the Schrödinger Maestro software
(www.schrodinger.com) by adding hydrogens, generating protonation states, and
optimizing hydrogen positions. The quality of the original and processed structures
was assessed using the software tools Verify3D [23], WHATCHECK [24] and PROCHECK
[25], confirming the suitability of the structures for docking simulations in terms of

common quality control checks [26]. For structure files containing multiple chains, the
chain with the highest Verify3D score was chosen for further analysis.

Ligand pre-processing and filtering
Small molecule compounds were obtained from the databases ZINC [20], SWEETLEAD
[21], and the public library provided by the company MolPort (www.molport.com). All
ligands from the SWEETLEAD database were first preprocessed using the AutoDock
ligand preparation script, and docked into the 3CLpro binding pocket using AutoDockGPU [27]. For the ZINC database, in order to focus on compounds that are
commercially available and have drug-like chemical and ADMETox properties, a
filtering was first applied by downloading only compounds with the properties “druglike”, “purchasable” (minimum purchasability = “Wait OK”) and reactivity = “clean”.
This first-step filtering reduced the initial 1,276,766,435 substances to 898,838,573
retained substances. These filtered compounds were downloaded in SMILES-format,
using the “ZINC-downloader-2D-smi.wget” script derived from the “Tranches” webpage on ZINC (https://zinc.docking.org/tranches/home).
The pre-selection of compounds from ZINC was then further filtered using a ligandbased similarity screening. For this purpose, a similarity assessment approach
involving a graph-based molecular representation known as “feature trees” was
applied, as implemented in the BioSolveIT Ftrees software (version 6.2). With this
method the topological and physicochemical similarity of the library compounds to
known small-molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro reported in the literature was scored
(considering inhibitors for both the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 versions of the 3CLpro
protein). Specifically, the literature-derived query compounds include the reported

SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors GC-376 [18], ebselen [28,29] and baicalein [30], and the
reported SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors amentoflavone [31], hesperetine [32],
pectolinarin [33] and dieckol [34]. Moreover, to further extend the search space of
potential candidate inhibitor compounds, four additional query compounds for the
feature tree search were included by adding the top-ranked compounds from the
initial AutoDock-GPU screening (see above). All compounds from the ZINC library
exceeding a minimum similarity threshold of 0.8 in the FTrees screen to these query
compounds were retained for the subsequent molecular docking analyses.
For the screening of the MolPort compound library, due to its smaller size (~7.7 million
compounds) compared to the ZINC library, we tested multiple alternative more
extensive screening approaches without prior library filtering: (1) a screening
approach relying purely on fast molecular docking approaches (see details in following
section), (2) a screening approach relying purely on machine learning (see section on
‘Machine learning based compound screening’ below), and (3) a combination of
molecular docking and ligand-similarity based screening using the software FTrees
(following the same approach as for the ZINC database, but without prior database
filtering, and focusing on the most potent available 3CLPro inhibitor, GC-376, as query
compound; see following section for the description of the docking analyses).

Receptor-based screening using molecular docking
In order to obtain a robust ranking of compounds using molecular docking, the
compound libraries prepared in the previous step (i.e. the filtered version of the ZINC
database, and the unfiltered SWEETLEAD and MolPort databases) were docked into
the 3CLpro binding pocket using three different approaches, AutoDock-GPU [27],

OpenEye HYBRID [35–37], and LeadIT/FlexX [38]. To use the available computing time
efficiently and only consider compounds with high relative ranking scores for all
docking approaches for further analysis, the two most time-efficient docking methods
AutoDock-GPU and OpenEye HYBRID were first run on the pre-selected compound
libraries, and only compounds with higher than average scores from the AutoDockGPU and OpenEye HYBRID screens were also docked using FlexX, including a
subsequent estimation of the binding affinity for the top 30 docking poses using the
LeadIT/HYDE approach [39]. For the MolPort library, we compared both a screening
approach relying purely on molecular docking of the unfiltered library, and a joint
docking and ligand similarity-based scoring approach, which filtered the compounds
by including only those reaching a minimum similarity threshold of 0.8 in the ligandbased screening using FTrees (see previous section). Finally, the resulting list of all
docked compounds was ranked and sorted according to the sum of ranks across the
scores for each docking method. Visualizations of the top-scoring docked compounds
were generated in the software Chimera [40] and binding interactions were analyzed
using PoseView [41].

Molecular dynamics simulations
To assess the ligand binding stability for the top-ranked compounds derived from the
docking simulations in the 3CLpro binding pocket, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were carried out using a GPU-accelerated version of the software NAMD
(Git-2020-07-30 for Linux-x86_64-multicore-CUDA, [42]). Topology and force field
parameters for the MD simulations were assigned from the CHARMM36 protein lipid
parameter set [43,44] for the receptor and from the CHARMM General Force Field

Machine learning based compound screening
As an alternative to conventional receptor- and ligand-based screening strategies, we
also tested a compound ranking approach using machine learning. For this purpose,
quantitative properties for the investigated compounds were determined by
calculating molecular descriptors as implemented in the R software package “rcdk”
(version 3.5.0) [46] using SMILES compound representations [47] as input. First,
molecular descriptors were computed for a previously published training set
collection of small molecules containing both previously reported SARS-CoV or SARSCoV-2 3CLPro inhibitors (486 compounds, used as positive set) and compounds
reported not to bind to 3CLPro (700 compounds, used as negative set) [48]. The
covered classes of descriptors in the package “rcdk” include topological descriptors
(e.g. TPSA, Wiener index, Kier-Hall Smarts descriptor), geometrical (e.g. gravitational
index, Petitjean shape index, moment of inertia), electronic (e.g. CPSA, H-bond donor
count, H-bond acceptor count), constitutional (e.g. rotatable bond count, acidic group
count, weight) and hybrid descriptors (WHIM and BCUT descriptors; see the

documentation of the rcdk software package to retrieve the complete list of more
than 200 descriptors).
A classification model using the Random Forest algorithm as implemented in the R
software package “randomForest” [49] was then built on this training data of
molecular descriptors for the positive and negative compound sets, using 250 decision
trees and default settings otherwise. This model was applied to all compounds from
the MolPort library, by computing the descriptors for each compound as input to the
model and generating probabilistic predictions. Finally, the predicted probability for
each compound to belong to the positive set of 3CLPro inhibitors was used to rank the
compounds, and the top 20 compounds with the highest probabilities were selected
for in vitro testing.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
In vitro assay for assessing the 3CLpro inhibitory activity of the compounds
Assay principle: Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays can be applied in
various configurations in cells [50] and in reporter systems [51] to detect molecular
proximity and with the proper biosensor also activity. Here we employed an in vitro
FRET assay for the evaluation of the candidate small molecule inhibitors for 3CLpro
obtained from the in silico screening approaches. We used a substrate peptide of
3CLpro labelled with a fluorescent dye (Dabcyl) and an acceptor-quencher (Edans) at
the N- and C-terminus, respectively. The substrate peptide does not fluoresce in the
uncleaved state, when the quencher blocks the fluorescence of the dye. When 3CLpro
cleaves the substrate, the fluorescence of the dye is de-quenched and an emission
signal is observed. The inhibitor blocking the activity of 3CLpro prevents FRET-peptide

cleavage. Thus, in the presence of an inhibitor a lower fluorescence signal is observed
[52].

Method: The assays were performed following the guidelines of the 3CL Protease
assay Kit (#79955, BPS Biosciences, San Diego CA, USA). The inhibitory effect on
3CLpro was assessed using the substrate peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKM-E(Edans)NH2, obtained from Biosyntan. The assays were run on a 384-well plate (black, low
volume, round bottom; Corning #4514) and the reaction volume per well was 20 µl.
Briefly, all candidate inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and three-fold or five-fold
diluted in the assay buffer. The known 3CLpro inhibitor and reference compound GC376 was dissolved in water and diluted from 100 µM. To the dilution series of
inhibitors, 3CLpro (100 ng/reaction) was added and incubated for 30 min at room
temperature (RT). Then 50 µM of substrate peptide was added. The reaction mix was
incubated at RT overnight with the plates sealed. On the next day, fluorescence
intensity was measured at excitation wavelength 360 ± 10 nm and emission 460 ± 20
nm using Clariostar (BMG Labtech, Germany) plate reader. 3CLpro used in the assay
was N-terminally MBP-tagged (MW – 77.5 kDa) and obtained from BPS Biosciences
(#100707). The data were fit into a log c(inhibitor) vs response three-parameter doseresponse model using the software Prism (GraphPad). IC50 value estimates were
determined individually for each replicate, and the mean and standard error of the
mean (SEM) were calculated. Importantly, many of the assessed compounds were
polyaromatic natural products, which exhibited interfering fluorescence or
absorbance in our FRET-based assay. Therefore, out of 96 compounds tested in the
3CLpro activity assay, 12 compounds were filtered out from further analysis

Assays involving principles of time-resolved FRET may be suitable for future follow-up
screening of compounds with background fluorescence [53,54].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In silico screening results and final compound selection for in vitro testing
For the experimental testing of candidate 3CLPro small molecule inhibitors, 86
commercially available compounds selected from the top-scoring candidates derived
from the different receptor-, ligand- and machine learning based screening
approaches (see Methods), which had passed all prior in silico filtering stages, were
ordered from the company MolPort. The complete list of tested screening
compounds, including common compound identifiers and characteristics (SMILES,
molecular weight, logP) is provided in the Supplementary Information. The 86 topranked compounds are subdivided into 18 compounds derived from the virtual
screening of the ZINC and SWEETLEAD libraries (Suppl. Table S2; see Methods for the
prefiltering and screening approaches), 30 compounds derived from the screening of
the MolPort library using combined ligand similarity screening and molecular docking
(Suppl. Table S3), 18 compounds from the screening of the MolPort library using
combinations of docking algorithms only (Suppl. Table S4), and 20 compounds from
the purely machine learning derived compound ranking for the MolPort library (Suppl.
Table S5). In addition to these screening-derived compounds, the known inhibitor GC376 [18] was included as a reference compound, and the following commercially
available compounds previously reported as SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV 3CLPro
inhibitors in the literature, were also acquired for experimental inhibitory activity

assessments: Ebselen [28,29], baicalein [30], amentoflavone [31], hesperetine [32],
pectolinarin [33], luteolin [31], quercetin [31], pristimerin [55], and 1hydroxypyridine-2-thione zinc [56]. For the compounds confirmed as binders, PAINS
and Brenk's substructure alerts [57,58] were checked to determine frequent hitters
(promiscuous compounds, see Table 2). GC-376 is a prodrug that converts into the
peptide aldehyde GC-373 [59]; hence, the active compound is GC-373, and the
inhibitor is therefore referred to as “GC-376 / GC-373” in the following. Example video
animations of the MD simulations which were applied to the top-ranked dockingderived compounds to confirm the stability of the binding are provided online
together with the configuration settings used for the MD simulation software NAMD
(https://github.com/eglaab/3clpro).

In vitro testing results for candidate 3CLpro inhibitors
In total, 95 selected compounds were assessed to determine their in vitro 3CLpro
inhibitory activity, including the 86 candidate compounds identified from the in silico
analyses and 9 candidate compounds derived from the literature, as described above.
GC-376 was used as a positive control for 3CLpro inhibitory activity. The IC50 value of
GC-376 was in the low micromolar range (0.18 to 0.98 µM), matching approx. with
previously reported IC50 values for GC-376 (0.19 μM) and its structurally similar
metabolized form, GC-373 (0.4 μM) [59] (see Suppl. Information for the doseresponse curves). The Z’ value [60], used as a measure of assay robustness, ranged
from 0.5 to 0.8, indicating the suitability of the assay for compound screening in a
high-throughput format. Importantly, the main purpose of the activity assay is to

Table 1: Hits from 3CLpro screening assay with IC50 values. *For the compounds no. 1 and 3 only a
limited amount of the reagent could be acquired, and therefore no replicate runs could be performed
for these specific compounds.

Overall, 7 out of the 95 tested compounds were confirmed as active, with a lowest
IC50 of 31 µM for the screening compound M-8524 (CID 46897844, see Table 1).
Considering the different conducted screening analyses separately, each type of
strategy uniquely identified at least one of the confirmed inhibitors: (1) The
combination of molecular docking and ligand similarity screening on the ZINC
database identified the inhibitor rottlerin among 18 compounds tested, (2) the
screening of the MolPort database using fast docking approaches detected another
inhibitor (compound M-1805) out of 18 tested candidates, and (3) the screening of the
MolPort library using machine learning identified a further inhibitor out of 20 assessed
compounds. The complete list of active compounds, including their names, vendor ID,
IC50 values and 2D structure representations are shown in Table 1. Detailed assay
validation results and dose-response curves for these inhibitors are provided in the
Supplementary Information.

ADMETox and bioavailability properties of the 3CLpro screening assay hits
While the identified inhibitors did not display a higher activity than the currently
available most potent inhibitor GC-376 / GC-373, used as reference compound,
multiple of the confirmed actives are natural compounds with favorable bioavailability
and ADMETox (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity)
properties, that may provide a basis for follow-up structure design optimization

a basis for further structural and chemical optimization. By contrast, the reference

filters are highlighted in green color, failed tests are marked in red color.

Apart from the computationally estimated ADME properties, prior information on
bioavailability and ADMETox characteristics was available for some of the natural
products among the confirmed inhibitors. The natural compound with the lowest IC50
value, rottlerin, is derived from the powder that covers the capsules of the
tree Mallotus phillippinensis (also known as Indian Kamala, Rottlera tree, or monkeyfaced tree) [68], which mainly occurs in Asia, Afghanistan and Australia. The powder
has traditionally been used as antiparasitic agent against the tapeworm in India for
multiple centuries, providing a first indication of favorable safety properties. In mouse
model studies, rottlerin was investigated as a preventive or adjuvant supplement for
pancreatic cancer [69], as a protective agent against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity
[70], and as a potential medication in a psoriasis model, where it was well tolerated
with no significant changes in bodyweight [71]. Tissue bioavailability and
pharmacokinetic analyses in vitro and in vivo suggest that rottlerin is efficiently
absorbed in cells and tissues [69].

The natural product with the second lowest IC50 is amentoflavone, which had
previously already been reported to inhibit the 3CLpro protein from SARS-CoV (the
virus from the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak) [31]. However, a later study suggested that
the binding reaction results from a non-specific aggregate formation or complexation,
because no effective inhibition was observed in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100
[33]. Amentoflavone is a biflavonoid contained in several plant species including
Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), Xerophyta plicata and
Chamaecyparis obtusa. No detailed prior toxicological studies of amentoflavone could
be identified, but several bioactivities have been reported in the biomedical literature,
including anti-viral effects [72,73].
Among the other natural compounds confirmed to bind to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro,
baicalein displays some of the most favorable drug-likeness scores (see Table 2). This
flavonoid is found in the dried roots of the plant Scutellaria baicalensis (S. baicalensis)
Georgi [74], and was previously already reported to display an antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV in vitro [75] and to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease in vitro [30]. The
use of baicalein containing roots was widespread in traditional Chinese herbal
medicine over centuries, and a wide range of pharmacological activities have been
identified. These include antiviral activities were reported for further virus species
apart from SARS corona viruses, including dengue virus [76,77], H5N1 influenza A virus
[78], and Japanese encephalitis virus [79].
Luteolin, a structurally similar compound to baicalein, also displayed similar estimated
ADME properties in terms of favorable drug-likeness and bioavailability scores (see
Table 2), and an inhibitory effect of luteolin on SARS-CoV 3CLpro was observed in a
previous study using a FRET assay (IC50 = 20.2 µM) [31]. Regarding the bioavailability

of luteolin, oral administration of pure luteolin in rats (14.3 mg/kg) has been shown to
result in a limited peak plasma concentration of 1.97 ± 0.15 μg/mL, which was
increased to 8.34 ± 0.98 μg/mL when delivering the compound in peanut hull extracts
[80]. Luteolin is contained in small quantities in both medicinal plants and commonly
consumed vegetables and spices (e.g. broccoli, thyme, pepper, and celery), and
displays no mutagenic effects in the Ames test in contrast to other flavonoids [81],
such as quercetin. Interestingly, quercetin, which only differs structurally from luteolin
by the position and number of hydroxyl groups, was also reported to bind to SARSCoV 3CLpro [31], but with a slightly higher IC50 than luteolin (IC 50 = 23.8 µM). When
testing quercetin as a candidate inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro in the FRET analyses
reported here, it did however not show any activity. This suggests that the hydroxyl
group positions in flavonoids are an important determinant of their activity for SARSCoV-2 3CLpro.
Finally, the last natural product confirmed to bind to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro is
pectolinarin. It was previously already found to block the enzymatic activity of SARSCoV 3CL protease according to a FRET protease assay, using a similar approach as in
the study presented here [33]. The compound is isolated from plants of the genus
Cirsium. Specifically, the plant Cirsium setidens, which contains pectolinarin as a major
active compound, has been used in traditional Korean medicine against hypertension,
hemostasis, hematoma and hematuria [82]. Regarding prior pharmacokinetics studies
for pectolinarin, after oral administration of 6 mL/kg Cirsium japonicum DC extract in
rats, the maximum plasma concentration of the component pectolinarin was 877 ±97
ng/mL, reached after 5 min. [83]. However, pectolinarin displays low drug- and leadlikeness and bioavailability scores in the computational estimations (see Table 2).

Pharmacophore model for 3CLpro small molecule inhibitors
In order to generate a pharmacophore model that describes characteristic features of
3CLpro small molecule inhibitors, we investigated the interactions of the identified
inhibitors with residues in the receptor binding pocket using the best scoring docking
pose for each compound according to the binding affinity estimation by the software
HYDE. For the reference inhibitor GC-376 / GC-373 used for comparison, the relevant
pose was derived from a crystal structure which contains this compound in complex
with 3CLPro (PDB ID: 7D1M). Similarly, for compound baicalein a crystal structure of
the complex with 3CLpro was already available (PDB ID: 6M2N) and used to extract
the binding pose. Figure 2 shows the 2D representations of the estimated hydrogen
bond interactions (dotted lines) and hydrophobic contacts (green lines) for each
inhibitor in the 3CLPro binding pocket as determined using the software PoseView
[41].

An overview of the binding pocket residues involved in these protein-ligand

compounds in color, and representing identical residues by identical colors. Most
hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts with binding pocket residues
are shared by multiple ligands, suggesting that they reflect a common binding mode
and a characteristic signature of interactions that favor stable ligand binding. The
residues most frequently participating in these protein-ligand interactions are Glu166
(involved in hydrogen bonds for 8 inhibitors, and in hydrophobic contacts for 3
inhibitors), Thr190 (H-bonds: 6, Contacts: 2), Gln189 (H-bonds: 2, Contacts: 3) and
Gln192 (H-bonds: 6). Interestingly, the two residues His41 and Cys145 which have

previously been confirmed to be critical for catalysis [84] are also involved in hydrogen
bond interactions with some of the inhibitors (His41 for amentoflavone; Cys145 for
GC-376 / GC-373) and hydrophobic contacts (His41 for GC-376 / GC-373,
amentoflavone, and baicalein; Cys145 for baicalein), and these compounds may
directly interfere with the catalytic mechanism. Overall, both the shared interactions
(see Table 3) and the graphic overlay of the docked or crystal structure derived ligand
conformations (see Figure 3) suggest that the confirmed inhibitors use a similar
binding mode to engage the 3CLpro binding pocket.

Next, we created dedicated pharmacophore models for each of the inhibitors using
the structure-based pharmacophore design approach in the software LigandScout
[85]. Two example pharmacophore models are shown in Figure 4 for the reference
compound GC-376 / GC-373 (Figure 4 a), and the newly identified inhibitor rottlerin
(Figure 4 b), respectively. These two compounds occupy a similar space in the binding
pocket, like most identified inhibitors in their docked binding conformation (see Figure
3), but engage at least partly in different hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions
with the residues in the pocket. Thus, by merging the pharmacophore models for
these and all other confirmed inhibitors into a single model, further virtual screening
and structural design optimization efforts may exploit the unified model to identify
new inhibitors with suitable steric properties that engage in more energetically
favorable combinations of interactions than those covered by the already identified
actives. Therefore, the pharmacophore models for the individual ligands were
integrated by aligning the structures and their associated pharmacophores by
receptor-derived reference points and interpolating the overlapping features, using
the default settings in the LigandScout software. In contrast to the models for the
individual inhibitors, the resulting merged pharmacophore model does not lend itself
to direct interpretation, due to its larger coverage of potential binding interactions
that can be exploited by a ligand. However, its more comprehensive coverage of
potential interactions provides a computational resource for further screening studies

on independent compound databases that is more informative than individual
structures of protein-ligand complexes. The merged pharmacophore model has
therefore been made available in the “Compressed Pharmaceutical Markup
Language” (PMZ) format on GitHub (https://github.com/eglaab/3clpro).

green spheres and arrows to hydrogen bond donors. b) Pharmacophore model for 3CLpro derived from
the inhibitor rottlerin using the software LigandScout (conformation obtained from the best scoring

comparison of rottlerin and GC-376 / GC-373 suggests that they occupy a similar space in the 3CLpro
binding pocket and share a hydrogen bond interaction with the residue Glu166, most interactions are
distinct. This may open up possibilities for the screening of new compounds that exploit interactions
from the pharmacophore models of both the GC-376 / GC-373 and rottlerin ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
The SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro protein is one of the main drug targets of interest for COVID19, due to its critical role in viral replication, the availability of multiple high quality
protein crystal structures and the prior identification of first small molecule inhibitors
as a basis to computationally screen for inhibitors with improved inhibitory activity,
bioavailability and ADMETox characteristics.
The combined computational and experimental analyses presented here reveal new
natural and synthetic compounds inhibiting 3CLpro with micromolar activity, e.g.
rottlerin and M-9420, and provide a pharmacophore model that describes key
structural and chemical properties of active compounds. Both this pharmacophore
and the confirmed hits provide a resource to support follow-up efforts on the
structural design of more potent and selective 3CLpro inhibitors and similarity-based
inhibitor screening in additional compound databases. The pharmacophore analyses
suggest that many of the 3CLpro inhibitors share hydrogen bond and hydrophobic
interactions with binding pocket residues, including interactions with the two residues
His41 and Cys145, that have previously been confirmed to be critical for catalysis.
Apart from the new inhibitors identified through the screening of the ZINC,
SWEETLEAD and MolPort databases, we also assessed compounds previously
proposed as SARS-CoV 3CLPro inhibitors in the literature in terms of their SARS-CoV-2
3CLPro inhibitory activity, confirming amentoflavone, baicalein, luteolin and
pectolinarin as actives (albeit with lower affinities then GC-376 / GC-373, rottlerin and
M-9420, among others), and rejecting several other candidate compounds as actives
(in the lists of tested compounds in the Suppl. Information, the confirmed compounds
are all marked with a star symbol; the compounds which could not be assessed in the

assay due to high background fluorescence are marked in blue, and all other
compounds were invalidated). Analyses of ADMETox and physicochemical parameters
of the confirmed hit compounds show that these compounds differ significantly with
regard to relevant known or computationally estimated properties, and that a subset
of the hits displays favorable bioavailability and safety characteristics in terms of the
prior knowledge available.
Regarding the computational methodological aspects of the project, as part of the
virtual screening we have tested different screening approaches, including the
integration of molecular docking and ligand similarity screening, the combined
application of fast docking approaches without prior compound library filtering, and
the use of machine learning for screening. The observation that each of these
approaches uniquely identified at least one of the experimentally confirmed inhibitors
suggests that the different screening strategies provide independent and
complementary information, which can help to increase the overall number and
diversity of the identified active compounds. Identifying structurally and chemically
diverse active compounds with a similar binding mode is important for the creation of
more comprehensive integrated pharmacophore models.
As a next step, extended screening and structural optimization analyses for 3CLpro
inhibitors will be required. This will help to pave the way for additional activity
assessments in preclinical models and the subsequent development of lead
compounds.
