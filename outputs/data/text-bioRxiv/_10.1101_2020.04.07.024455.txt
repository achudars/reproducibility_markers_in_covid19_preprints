Abstract.
Cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the
human population. In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been
associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and
death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to
be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral
immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication
of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate
that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged
with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these
animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and
die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver
hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these
results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and
consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate
that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome
21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or hypercytokinemia, often referred to as a ‘cytokine storm’,
has been postulated to drive mortality during severe respiratory viral infections, such as influenza
(1) - including the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic (2) and the H5N1 bird flu (3), as well as during the
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus epidemic of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) (4).
Increasing evidence supports the notion that mortality during infections with SARS-CoV-2,
which causes coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), is driven by the exacerbated immune
response to the virus, leading to a cascade of events involving a cytokine storm and acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often accompanied by myocardial damage and multiple
organ failure (5, 6). This pathological cascade resembles what is observed in other lethal viral
lung infections, where the immune response to the virus triggers a primary wave of cytokines,
including Type I and Type III interferons (IFNs), followed by infiltration and activation of
diverse immune cells and production of secondary cytokines and chemokines, including Type II
IFN (IFN-g), accelerated immune activation, and progressive decline of respiratory function (7).
Importantly, many of the cytokines and chemokines involved in the cytokine storm employ Janus
protein kinases (JAKs) for signal transduction.
Cytokine analysis of COVID-19 patients indicate an important role for the magnitude of the
cytokine storm in prognosis and clinical outcome. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 at
the time of hospitalization were reported to be significantly higher in patients who eventually
died versus those that survived (5). In a different study, patients admitted to intensive care units
(ICUs) showed significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-10, IL-7, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, G-CSF,
and TNF-α relative to non-ICU patients (6). Using artificial intelligence methods, high levels of
circulating alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a marker of liver inflammation, was associated with

progression toward ARDS (8). Altogether, these findings support the rationale for combining
antiviral treatment and targeted immunosuppression as a therapeutic approach in COVID-19 (9).
Accordingly, several clinical trials are currently testing the safety and efficacy of inhibitors of
IL-6 signaling and JAK/STAT signaling. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine, a molecule shown
to attenuate Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine production that is approved for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (10, 11), is also being testing
in many clinical trials for COVID-19.
Within this context, we report here relevant results obtained during studies of the hyperactive
immune response in a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS). We recently discovered that
trisomy 21 (T21), the genetic cause of DS, causes consistent activation of the IFN transcriptional
response in multiple cell types (12-15), which is explained by the fact that four of the six IFN
receptors are encoded on chromosome 21 (IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNGR2, IL10RB). Additional
investigations of the proteome (16), metabolome (14), and immune cell lineages (13, 15) of
people with DS demonstrated that T21 causes: 1) changes in the circulating proteome indicative
of chronic autoinflammation with clear dysregulation of IFN-inducible cytokines (16), 2)
activation of the IFN-inducible kynurenine pathway, leading to elevated production of
neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites (14), and 3) widespread hypersensitivity to IFN stimulation
across the human immune system (13, 15). Altogether, these results support the notion that DS
can be understood in good measure as an interferonopathy, whereby increased IFN signaling
could account for many of the developmental and clinical impacts of T21. Now, we report results
generated during our investigation of immune responses in the Dp16(1)/Yey mouse strain
(referred hereto as Dp16) (17), a widely used mouse model of DS. The Dp16 strain carries a
segmental duplication of murine chromosome 16 that is syntenic to human chromosome 21,

encoding ~119 genes, including the four Ifnrs. We found that Dp16 mice overexpress Ifnrs in all
immune cell types tested, display hypersensitivity to Type I and Type II IFN stimulation,
overproduce key cytokines, and display increased liver inflammation. Remarkably, Dp16 mice
display lethal immune responses upon challenge with viral mimetic molecules, such as the TLR3
agonist poly-I:C [P(I:C)] or the TLR7/8 agonist imiquimod, a phenotype that is not observed in
their wild type (WT) littermates or mouse strains carrying triplications of other genomic regions
syntenic to chromosome 21. Strikingly, both the lethal immune phenotype and associated
cytokine storm are blocked by treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of the JAK1 kinase,
which also decreases liver pathology.
Overall, these results have potential far-reaching significance for the treatment of COVID-19,
justifying a deeper study of JAK inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy to attenuate the cytokine
storm and downstream organ failure in this condition, while also indicating that individuals with
DS should be considered a high-risk population during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results.
Dp16 mice overexpress Ifnrs and show heightened sensitivity to IFN stimulation.
In order to model the impact of T21 on chronic innate immune responses in mice, we employed
the Dp16 mouse strain, which harbors triplication of a region syntenic to human chromosome 21
including four Ifnrs (Figure 1A) (17). To define the relationship between gene copy number and
IFNR protein expression, we evaluated surface expression of IFNAR1 in peripheral immune
cells from Dp16 mice by flow cytometry. Dp(10)1Yey/+ and Dp(17)Yey/+ mice (hereafter
referred to as Dp10 and Dp17), which have three copies of genes that are syntenic to
chromosome 21, but are disomic for Ifnrs (18), were included as controls (Figure 1A).

Expression of IFNAR1 on the surface of CD45+ white blood cells was significantly higher in
Dp16 mice, but not Dp10 or Dp17 animals, relative to WT littermates (Figure 1B). When
different immune cell types were analyzed by flow cytometry, IFNAR1 expression was
significantly higher in all cell types tested (Figure 1C). These results are consistent with
previous reports of mRNA overexpression for all Ifnrs in this gene cluster in various tissues of
Dp16 mice (12, 19).
To test whether upregulation of Ifnrs conferred stronger responses to IFN ligands, we stimulated
WT and Dp16 blood samples with IFN-a and evaluated downstream phosphorylation of STAT1
(pSTAT1) by flow cytometry. Dp16 cells responded more strongly to IFN-a as defined by
significantly higher levels of pSTAT1 relative to WT cells, in all immune lineages examined
(Figure 1D). This widespread heightened response to IFN-a was not observed in Dp10 and
Dp17 cells; however, T cell subsets from the Dp17 strain exhibited more robust pSTAT1
(Figure 1E-F). Although Dp17 mice have only two copies of the Ifnr genes, this result suggests
that some aspect of triplication of the region of chromosome 17 syntenic to human chromosome
21 leads to differential regulation of Type I IFN signaling in T cells.
Given that one of the Type II IFN receptor subunits (Ifngr2) is also encoded on murine
chromosome 16 and triplicated in Dp16 mice, we next investigated the response to IFN-g
stimulation. Indeed, Dp16 cells responded more strongly to IFN-g stimulation in most cell types
examined (Figure 1G).
Overall, these results suggest that elevated expression of the Ifnrs in the Dp16 mouse strain
confers increased sensitivity to Type I and Type II IFNs.

Dp16 mice display lethal immune responses to IFN-inducing TLR agonists.
Since Dp16 cells mount enhanced responses to IFN ligands, we next investigated the response of
Dp16 mice to innate immune stimuli known to trigger an IFN response. Chronic systemic
induction of IFN signaling was elicited by repeated administration of the TLR3 agonist
polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [P(I:C)], which is known to produce an acute spike of Type I IFN
production (1-3 days), followed by low but persistent expression of Type I IFN ligands and a
robust cytokine response in the chronic phase (5-30 days) (20). WT and Dp16 mice were given
intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg of P(I:C) or an equivalent volume of vehicle (sham) every
other day, for up to 16 days, with the experiment completed at day 17. Remarkably, Dp16 mice
were profoundly sensitive to the treatment, which was largely tolerated by WT mice (Figure
2A). Body weight measurements during the course of the experiment revealed rapid weight loss
in Dp16 mice upon treatment (Figure 2B). Eventually, all but one of the twelve Dp16 mice had
to be removed from the study for excessive weight loss (>15%). In contrast, WT animals did not
lose as much weight, and all but three out of nine survived to the end of the experiment (Figure
2A,B). Dp10 and Dp17 mice also tolerated chronic immune stimulation with P(I:C) (Figure 2CF). Although P(I:C) treatment caused some weight loss in both Dp10 and Dp17 mice, the
percentage lost was comparable to WT levels. This P(I:C)-induced weight loss was clearly dosedependent, as mice receiving half the lethal dose (5 mg/kg) displayed only minor weight loss,
with no observable differences between Dp16 and WT mice (Figure S1).
In order to determine whether hypersensitivity was restricted to TLR3 agonists or more broadly
observed across activation of other pattern recognition receptors, we treated the mice with the
TLR7 agonist imiquimod. Topical administration of imiquimod causes IFN production, acute
skin inflammation, systemic inflammation, and dehydration, and is commonly employed as a

model of psoriasis (21). Imiquimod treatment caused significant weight loss in Dp16 mice
despite daily administration of supportive fluids, which led to rapid termination of the study in
observation of the humane endpoint (Figure 2G,H). In contrast, WT animals receiving identical
treatment maintained their weight (Figure 2G,H).
Altogether, these results indicate that the hypersensitivity to IFN stimulation observed at the
cellular level in Dp16 mice associates with increased sensitivity and lethality to IFN-inducing
viral mimetic agents at the organismal level.

Dp16 mice display signs of hyperinflammation upon activation of TLR signaling.
We next compared the immune response in Dp16 mice relative to their wild type littermates
during the acute and chronic responses to P(I:C). First, we measured levels of circulating IFN-a
6 hours after the first injection of P(I:C) (or sham). IFN-a levels were induced by P(I:C), with a
stronger response in Dp16 mice (Figure 3A). Elevated IFN ligand production in Dp16 mice is
consistent with a predicted fast-forward loop driven by increased IFNR expression in DS (22).
We then measured mRNA expression for several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the spleen of
WT and Dp16 mice at 24 hours after a single injection of P(I:C) (or sham). This experiment
revealed strong induction of ISG expression upon P(I:C) treatment, with several ISGs being
more significantly elevated in the Dp16 mice than in WT animals (Figure 3B).
Next, we measured the levels of several cytokines and chemokines in the bloodstream 24 hours
after a single P(I:C) injection. Expectedly, P(I:C)-treated animals showed increased levels of
many pro-inflammatory factors, regardless of genotype (Figure 3C and Figure S2A). In this
acute phase, the most significantly elevated inflammatory markers were IP-10 (Cxcl10), MCP-1,
RANTES (Ccl5), and KC/GRO (Cxcl5) (Figure 3C). On average, Dp16 mice did not show
significant differences in expression of cytokines relative to their WT littermates. Then, we
measured circulating cytokines and chemokines during the chronic response. We compared
serum levels between Dp16 mice taken at the time of harvest due to reaching the humane
endpoint of 15% weight loss to the levels in the WT littermates that survived to the end of the
17-day experiment. At these later stages of chronic inflammation, several of these inflammatory
markers were significantly elevated in the Dp16 animals, such as MCP-1 and MIP-1a, but not in
the WT littermates (Figure 3D).

Altogether, these results indicate that activation of TLR signaling leads to strong induction of
key cytokine and chemokines in our experimental paradigm, with several inflammatory markers
being more elevated in the Dp16 mice. Although not a single cytokine or chemokine stands out
as the sole driver of phenotypes in the Dp16 mice, the mild over-production of several cytokines
could potentially contribute to their exacerbated immune sensitivity.

Dp16 mice show increased liver inflammation and pathology.
Next, we investigated markers of liver inflammation and injury. The serum levels of the enzymes
alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), two commonly used markers of
hepatocyte injury, were significantly elevated upon P(I:C) treatment in the Dp16 mice, reaching
concentrations nearly an order of magnitude higher than those observed in their WT littermates
(Figure 4A). Prompted by these results, we investigated liver pathology. Liver tissue sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and evaluated by a trained histologist, blinded
against treatment group and genotype. Scoring of liver pathology was done with procedures
adapted for mice (23) using a validated histological scoring system (24), that included
parameters such as cell injury, inflammation, and reactive changes, leading to an overall liver
pathology score. This analysis revealed that Dp16 mice have increased liver pathology even
before P(I:C) treatment, as demonstrated by significantly higher levels of cell injury,
inflammation, and reactive changes relative to their WT littermates (Figure 4B,C). This basal
level of liver pathology was not observed in the Dp10 and Dp17 mice (Figure 4D,E).
Importantly, upon treatment with P(I:C), the livers of WT animals developed pathology scores
comparable or greater than those observed at baseline in Dp16 mice, including signs of strong
recruitment and/or expansion of inflammatory cells. When P(I:C) was administered to Dp16
mice, all metrics of liver pathology increased, leading to significantly higher overall pathology
scores relative to both Dp16 sham treatment and WT upon P(I:C) treatment (Figure 4B-C).
Livers from Dp10 and Dp17 mice that received P(I:C) also experienced increases in liver
pathology, but these changes did not differ from WT mice (Figure 4D,E).

Overall, these results indicate that Dp16 mice display increased liver inflammation and
pathology, both at baseline and upon immune activation, which could potentially contribute to
their heightened sensitivity to IFN-inducing agents.

JAK1 inhibition blocks the lethal rampant immune response.
All three types of IFN signaling employ the JAK1 kinase for signal transduction, in combination
with either JAK2 or TYK2 (Figure 1A). Therefore, we sought to determine whether inhibiting
JAK1 specifically would block the lethality and pathology caused by P(I:C) treatment in Dp16
mice. To this end, we used the JAK1-specific inhibitor INCB54707. Animals received a dose of
60 mg/kg of INCB54707 (or an equivalent volume of methylcellulose used as the vehicle) twice
daily via oral gavage, beginning 24 hours prior to the first P(I:C) injection, and every day during
the course of the experiment. Remarkably, Dp16 mice that received the JAK1 inhibitor all
survived the P(I:C) treatment, while Dp16 animals that received the vehicle and P(I:C)
experienced weight loss and had to be euthanized (Figure 5A). We then analyzed the impact of
JAK1 inhibition on cytokine production by comparing the Dp16 mice treated with P(I:C) with
and without co-treatment with the JAK1 inhibitor. Importantly, cytokine production was strongly
abrogated by JAK1 inhibition (Figure 5B and Figure S3). Lastly, we evaluated the impact of
JAK1 inhibition on markers of liver inflammation and injury. Indeed, the JAK1 inhibitor led to a
reduction of circulating levels of ALT and AST, as well as a decrease in overall liver pathology
scores (Figure 5C).
Altogether, these results indicate that blocking the catalytic activity of the JAK1 kinase prevents
the lethality associated with a rampant innate immune response in the Dp16 mouse model. The
efficacy of this treatment likely relies on a combination of inter-related effects, such as reduced
cytokine production and improved liver function.

Discussion.
As the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly progresses worldwide, there is a dire need to identify new
prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Based on recent data from analyses of inflammatory
markers in COVID-19 (5, 6) and prior knowledge about inflammatory responses in other lethal
viral lung infections, targeted immune-suppression is now appreciated as a potential strategy to
prevent ARDS, fulminant myocarditis, organ failure, and mortality at advanced stages of the
condition (9). Accordingly, clinical trials for diverse immune-suppressants have been started
around the world, including inhibitors of IL-6 and JAK/STAT signaling.
Here, we demonstrate a key role for the JAK1 kinase in driving cytokine storms and
accompanying mortality in a mouse model of lethal anti-viral immune responses. JAK1 is one of
several JAK kinases required for mediating inflammatory signaling downstream of a large
number of cytokines, including all three types of IFN signaling and IL-6 (25). We show that
eliciting the innate anti-viral immune response with TLR agonists is lethal in a sensitized mouse
model carrying triplication of four of the six IFN receptors. Within days, the Dp16 mice rapidly
lose weight and die if unattended, concurrent with induction of many prominent cytokines linked
to the severity of COVID-19-driven pathology, such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, IP-10, MCP-1, and
MIP-1α (6). Furthermore, Dp16 mice display exacerbated liver inflammation and pathology,
which, together with stronger production of some cytokines, may converge into a pathological
cascade leading to wasting and death. Importantly, these phenotypes are blocked by JAK1
inhibition.
Based on these results, we propose here that JAK inhibitors are a valid therapeutic approach for
attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Four JAK inhibitors are currently FDA-approved
for the treatment of diverse medical conditions: Jakafi/Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor approved

for myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and graft-versus-host-disease; Xeljanz/Tofacitinib, a
JAK1/3 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis;
Olumiant/Baricitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor approved for rheumatoid arthritis; and
Rinvoq/Upadacitinib, a JAK1 inhibitor also approved for rheumatoid arthritis. Many JAK1specific inhibitors are currently being developed and tested in clinical trials for diverse
inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, including the molecule used in this study,
INCB54707.
We hypothesize that JAK inhibitors could be superior agents in terms of attenuating the cytokine
storm caused by COVID-19 relative to existing anti-IL6 agents, which consist of injectable
monoclonal antibodies that inhibit the interaction between IL-6 and its receptor IL-6R (26). In
contrast, JAK inhibitors are available as drugs administered orally, with very well characterized
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and may provide a more appropriate strategy to
transiently tone down the cytokine storm to prevent ARDS and fulminant myocarditis.
Furthermore, JAK1 inhibitors not only block IL-6 signaling, but also other inflammatory
pathways involved in the cytokine storm (25). Depending on the degree of inhibition of various
JAK kinases, it is predicted that available JAK inhibitors will block various aspects of the
cytokine storm, with potential for varying degrees of therapeutic benefit.
With regards to its relevance to therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 and other conditions
associated with cytokine storms, this study has several limitations. First, our mouse model does
not fully reproduce the human conditions associated with cytokine storms. Although
intraperitoneal injections of P(I:C) induce a clear cytokine storm in mice, this may be different in
quality and magnitude to what is observed in humans. Second, there is no active viral infection
or adaptive immune responses in our model. Furthermore, the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and

other lethal viruses that induce cytokine storms encode for proteins that modulate the immune
response, including anti-IFN factors (27, 28), and it is unclear how these viral factors may
modulate the course of disease and response to JAK inhibitors. Lastly, there may be significant
differences in the course of a cytokine storm initiated from the lung tissue, as opposed to the
more systemic response elicited in our model. Nevertheless, our results justify a thorough
analysis of JAK inhibitors in pre-clinical models and clinical trials in the ongoing efforts to
attenuate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Additionally, our results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the four IFNRs
encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered a high-risk population during the COVID-19
pandemic. Our studies of the Dp16 mice were originally driven by our interest in studying
immune dysregulation and IFN hyperactivity in DS. Of note, our results are consistent with
studies of SARS-CoV-1 demonstrating that Type I IFN signaling contributes to SARS-driven
pathology and mortality in mice (29). We predict that, as has been observed during RSV (30) and
H1N1 (31) infections, people with DS will develop more severe complications upon SARSCoV-2 infection, including higher rates of hospitalization and mortality. We hope these results
will encourage special attention to individuals with DS, including closer monitoring of
hyperinflammation during COVID-19, and inclusion in clinical trials for targeted immunesuppressants.

Materials and Methods.
Study design. This study originated from our interest in understanding immune responses and
IFN hyperactivity in mouse models of DS. All animal experiments were designed a priori,
including proper calculation of numbers of mice based on power analyses, and reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of
Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. All molecular and cellular biology experiments were
performed with validated reagents by trained personnel. All data generated is made publicly
available in the enclosed Supplemental Materials.
Mice. The Dp(10Prmt2-Pdxk)1Yey/J (Dp(10)1Yey/ + ), Dp(16Lipi-Zbtb21)1Yey/J
(Dp(16)1Yey/ + ), and Dp(17Abcg1-Rrp1b)1(Yey)/J (Dp(17)1Yey/ + ) strains have been
previously described (18). Dp16 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories or provided by
Drs. Faycal Guedj and Diana Bianchi at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development. Animals were maintained on the C57BL/6J background and
housed in specific pathogen-free conditions.
Chronic P(I:C) treatment. Vaccigrade P(I:C) (high molecular weight) was purchased from
Invivogen and reconstituted in saline according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mice were
injected with P(I:C) at 10 mg/kg of body weight at 2-day intervals for up to 16 days. Weight was
monitored throughout the duration of the experiment. Animals were sacrificed one day after the
final dose (day 17) or when they lost more than 15% of their body weight. For molecular
analysis, tissues were minced into small pieces and homogenized for 20 seconds in matrix LyseD tubes containing RLT and 0.143M b-mercaptoethanol.

INCB54707 (JAKi) treatment. Mice were treated with 60 mg/kg of INCB54707 (or an
equivalent volume of 0.5% methylcellulose vehicle) twice daily via oral gavage, beginning 24
hours prior to the first P(I:C) injection, and every day during the course of the experiment.
IFN stimulations and intracellular staining. Peripheral blood was collected from the
submandibular vein into Lithium Heparin tubes. 25 µL of blood were transferred to a 96-well
plate, briefly subjected to RBC lysis, and then re-suspended in 30 µL of media containing 10,000
units/mL of recombinant IFN-a2a or 100 units/mL of recombinant IFN-g (R&D Systems).
Antibodies against SiglecF, Ly6C, CD115 and CD11b and mouse FC receptors were also
included in the stimulation media. Cells were stimulated for 30 minutes at 37°C, washed once in
cold FACS buffer, then fixed in 200 µL of BD Lyse-Fix buffer for 10 minutes at 37° C. Cells
were permeabilized for 30 minutes in ice-cold permeabilization buffer III (BD phospho-flow).
Following permeabilization cells were stained with the following antibodies conjugated to
fluorophores: CD3 (17A2), CD4, CD8 (53.6.7), B220, Ly6C, MHCII, NK1.1 and phosphoSTAT1 (Tyr701).
Flow cytometry. Whole blood was lysed gently in RBC lysis buffer, then stained for surface
markers in FACS buffer at 4°C for 30 minutes. Cells were washed twice in FACS buffer, fixed
in 4% PFA for 10 minutes. Fixative was washed out and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
using either a BD LRS-Fortessa X-20 or the Cytek Aurora spectral cytometers. Antibody
information is provided in Table S1.
Q-RT-PCR. Q-RT-PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems Viia7™ 384-well block
real time PCR system. Q-RT-PCR master mix was prepared with Applied Biosystems SYBR
Select Master Mix for CFX. Standard curves were run for every primer pair in each Q-RT-PCR
experiment to ensure efficient amplification of target transcripts within all experimental tissues.

All samples were run in triplicate, averaged and normalized to 18s rRNA. Primer sequences at
provided in Table S2.
Cytokine measurements. Blood cytokine levels were measured using Mesoscale Discovery
Assays and/or Biolegend Legend plex assays per manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were
analyzed in duplicate and the average used for statistical analysis. Missing values were set to the
lower limit of detection.
Liver Histopathology. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pieces of liver were sectioned at 5
microns and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Scoring of liver pathology used
procedures adapted for mice as described (23) from the validated histological scoring system
established by Kleiner and Brunt (24).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analysis was done with the Prism software and the exact tests
employed are described in the legends for each figure. Statistical significance for Kaplan-Meier
analysis was calculated using the Mantel-Cox Log-rank test. All other p values were calculated
by Student’s T-test for all other results. In all cases, statistical significance is indicated as
follows: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.
