Abstract:
Passive immunisation using monoclonal antibodies will play a vital role in the fight against
COVID-19. Until now, the majority of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery efforts have relied
on screening B cells of patients in the convalescent phase. Here, we describe deep-mining of the
antibody repertoires of hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a combination of phage display
technology and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing to isolate neutralising antibodies and
gain insights into the early antibody response. This comprehensive discovery approach has yielded
potent neutralising antibodies with distinct mechanisms of action, including the identification of a
novel non-ACE2 receptor blocking antibody that is not expected to be affected by any of the major
viral variants reported. The study highlighted the presence of potent neutralising antibodies with
near germline sequences within both the IgG and IgM pools at early stages of infection.
Furthermore, we highlight a highly convergent antibody response with the same sequences
occurring both within this study group and also within the responses described in previously
published anti-SARS-CoV-2 studies.

Introduction:
In the past two decades, three major virus outbreaks caused by coronaviruses have emerged. The
latest, COVID-19 caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
has resulted in a pandemic with over 78 million people infected and causing over 1.7 million
deaths. The majority of drug development efforts have been focused on vaccine development, with
51 and 163 programs going through clinical and preclinical evaluation respectively at the

beginning of December 2020 (Source: WHO). Despite the accelerated development timeframes of
the leading vaccine candidates, the world is still one or two years away from attaining population
immunity due to the manufacturing and logistical challenges of mass vaccinating billions of
people. Therefore, monoclonal antibodies can become a key component in the early fight against
COVID-19. Viral neutralising antibodies can offer a two-in-one approach; they can be used both
to treat symptomatic individuals following acute exposure, and as a prophylactic to protect
healthcare workers and at-risk groups, including individuals who respond poorly to vaccines.
There are 13 experimental anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatments undergoing
clinical trials with bamlanivimab and a cocktail containing casirivimab and imdevimab receiving
Emergency Use Approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Most wellcharacterized and highly potent neutralising antibodies in both clinical and preclinical
development target the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD) (1). The
majority of these neutralising antibodies have been derived from single cell screening of memory
B cells from COVID-19 patients in their convalescent phase of disease (blood samples were
collected on average 32 days after the onset of symptoms, Table S1).
Here, we present a complementary discovery approach (Fig. 1), which combined phage
display technology and BCR repertoire sequence analysis. This approach allowed the isolation of
hundreds of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from the antibody repertoires of patients in the acute
phase of disease (blood samples collected on average 11 days (range 4-20) after the onset of
symptoms) and also to study the early antibody response. A comprehensive search of patientderived phage display libraries combined with high-throughput biochemical and functional
screening resulted in the discovery of highly potent neutralising antibodies, with diverse epitopes
and distinct mechanisms of action. An emphasis on developability testing as part of early discovery

screening facilitated selection of a panel of well characterised antibodies with biophysical
properties de-risked for downstream development and manufacturing. Armed with the knowledge
of functional binding activity, antibody sequences discovered by phage display were co-clustered
with whole BCR repertoire sequencing from the patients and published antibodies to understand
the nature and dynamics of the early antibody response, including the isotype usage, clonal
expansion and the level of convergence.
Results
Isolation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from patient derived libraries using phage display
technology
Peripheral blood samples of 18 patients admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19 pneumonia
were collected after obtaining informed consent. Patient demographics and clinical information
relevant to their admission were also collected (Table S2). The patients experienced an average of
11 days (range 4-20 days) of symptoms prior to the day on which the blood sample was taken.

Initial B cell receptor (BCR) sequence analysis of the V H repertoire of these patients
revealed a strong convergent sequence signature. In order to link sequence data to information on
binding properties, VH populations from these donors were incorporated into phage display
libraries in the form of single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding. By one approach we
constructed hybrid libraries (of size 0.9 x 109) where the variable heavy (VH) genes from the patient
IgG repertoire were combined with a pre-existing library of variable light (VL) genes derived from
healthy donors (2). The second strategy focussed on creating fully patient-derived libraries (of size
1.5 x 109) by assembling VHs and VLs on a donor-by-donor basis. Phage particles rescued from
these libraries were used to carry out 3 rounds of panning on monomeric RBD and S1 ectodomains.

The stringency of panning in each round was increased by reducing the antigen concentration to
enrich for higher affinity binders.

Following three rounds of panning, the selected populations from both sets of libraries were
sub-cloned en masse into an IgG expression vector while maintaining V H-VL pairing from the
selected scFvs. A total of 1498 clones were picked and expressed as IgG1 in Expi293F cells and
screened using an affinity capture assay which eliminates the effect of expression variation
between clones (3, 4). Of the 1498 clones expressed, 589 antibodies originated from the phage
panning against S1 and were screened against both RBD and S1, while the remaining 909 antibody
clones from RBD panning were screened only on RBD. This screen yielded a total of 719 binders
(48%). Surprisingly, a vast majority (87.3%) of the binders originating from S1 selections were
also directed at RBD epitopes, resulting in a mere 46 non-RBD S1 binders. The preferential
enrichment of antibodies to RBD over other S1 epitopes indicates that RBD is the key
immunogenic region within the S1 protein. Although the further characterisation of the S1 binders
led to identification of neutralising antibodies, these antibodies will be not discussed in detail in
this manuscript.
Functional, biochemical and biophysical characterisation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
It is reported that the primary mechanism of the most potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies
is by blocking the RBD interaction with ACE2 cell surface receptor (1, 5, 6). Therefore, we tested
394 RBD binders for their ability to block ACE2 in a biochemical assay (Fig. 2A), while carrying
out the Sanger sequencing of these clones in parallel. Of these, 254 antibodies had a unique VH
and VL CDR3 sequence and 172 unique antibodies showed >30% blocking in the biochemical
assay. From this category, 121 unique antibody blockers were selected for viral neutralisation

assays. In addition, 34 clones which failed to block the RBD-ACE2 interaction were progressed
in the search for alternative mechanisms of action. This panel of 155 antibodies was subsequently
purified from culture supernatants and screened in a lentiviral based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
assay at a concentration of 25 nM (3.5 µg/ml). 114 out of 121 (94.2%) ACE2 blocking antibodies
showed >30% neutralisation. Among this group, 97 (80.2%) antibodies showed neutralisation
activity exceeding 80%. Interestingly, a significant proportion of RBD-binding antibodies which
failed to show ACE2 blocking in the biochemical assay (50%) showed neutralisation of
pseudovirus, albeit significantly weaker than the ACE2 blockers (with 9/34 antibodies showing
>50% neutralisation and only 1 antibody exceeding 80% neutralisation). Selected antibodies from
the two different library approaches (“hybrid” versus fully patient derived) performed equally well
and produced a similar number of blockers and neutralisers (Fig. 2B).

The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the top 52 antibodies were determined
(Fig. 2C and Fig. S1). This experiment also included a number of recently published SARS-CoV2 neutralising antibodies including the potent antibody pair (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130)
identified by the Vanderbilt University-AstraZeneca team (7). Of the 52 antibodies tested, 38 were
categorised as strong neutralisers with IC50 values below 670 pM (100 ng/ml). Amongst the control
antibodies, COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 demonstrated best neutralisation with IC50 titres of 16
pM and 99 pM respectively. 11 of the most potent antibodies neutralised the pseudovirus with IC 50
ranging from 18-67 pM (2.7 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml) hence matching or exceeding the best antibodies
reported (5, 7-11).

In parallel to the pseudovirus neutralisation assay, the binding kinetics of 155 antibodies
were determined by high-throughput surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The affinities of these
antibodies ranged from 70 pM to 316 nM, with most antibodies clustered in the range of 1-30 nM
(Fig. 2D, Table S3). Comparison of the 52 clones tested for both affinity measurement and IC 50
determination in pseudoviral neutralisation assay, showed poor correlation between affinity and
neutralisation potency (Fig. S2A). In addition, the cross-reactivity of these antibodies to SARSCoV-1 and MERS-CoV were also evaluated using a binding assay based on time resolved
fluorescence (TRF). Only the antibodies that bound to SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV with binding
signals within 5-fold of SARS-CoV-2 were considered as cross-reactives. 29/155 (18.7 %) SARSCoV-2 antibodies tested for cross-reactivity showed binding to SARS-CoV-1 RBD, which
included 16 pseudovirus neutralisers (Fig. 3A). Unsurprisingly, none of the antibodies recognised
MERS-CoV S1 which has very low sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2 (~20%). Interestingly,
a significantly higher proportion of non-ACE2 blocking antibodies showed cross reactivity to
SARS-CoV-1 (55.9%) than the ACE2 blockers (8.3%).

Based on the potency of pseudovirus neutralisation, a final panel of 21 antibodies were selected
for further characterisation. Given the abundance of potent neutralisers, any antibodies with poor
transient expression and sequence liabilities (deamidation motifs in CDRs, unpaired cysteines and
glycosylation motifs in V regions) were excluded at this stage. This panel also included two nonblocking neutralisers, which despite showing only moderate neutralisation in the pseudovirus
assay were included due to their distinct mechanism of neutralisation. Initially, these antibodies
were evaluated for their ability to neutralise an authentic SARS-CoV-2 strain. A strong correlation
was observed between the pseudovirus and real virus neutralisation potencies (Fig. S2B). 16/19

ACE2 blocking antibodies (Fig. 3B, Fig. S3 and Table S4) neutralised the authentic virus with IC50
ranging from 100 pM (15 ng/ml) to ~670 pM (100 ng/ml). The control antibodies COV2-2196,
COV2-2130 and S309 neutralised the virus with IC50s of 120 pM, 840 pM and 2.4 nM respectively.
The two non-blocking neutralisers (ION_321 and ION_300) showed IC50s of 4.15 nM and 16 nM
respectively. Finally, 4 potent antibodies were tested as Fabs and IgGs to determine the importance
of valency in virus neutralisation. The neutralisation mediated by the IgGs were orders of
magnitude more potent than that of equivalent Fabs (Fig. 3C), suggesting the likely bivalent
engagement of both IgG arms. The increased virus neutralisation potency of IgG is likely a result
of enhanced viral engagement due to avidity but could also include crosslinking spike proteins
leading to aggregation of virions (12).

Given the prevalence of RBD mutations among the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates, it is
desirable to use a therapeutic approach that includes a cocktail of two or more antibodies directed
against non-competing epitopes with different mechanisms of viral neutralisation. In addition to
mitigating the risk of escape mutants, such an approach could also induce synergetic neutralisation
effects (13, 14). Therefore, the final panel of 21 neutralising antibodies were subjected to an
epitope binning experiment using Octet Bio-Layer Interferometry to identify binding sites on RBD
and their inter-relationships. Two control antibodies (COV2-2130 and COV2-2196) were also
included in the analysis. Based on the pairing patterns, 7 different epitope bins were identified
(Fig. 3D, Fig. S4). The majority of ACE2 blocking antibodies clustered into Bin A, which
overlapped with 4 other bins. However, within this group, Bin B/Bin E combination and Bin C/Bin
E combination were non-competitive. As expected, Bin G containing the two non-ACE2 blocking

neutralisers, showed no overlap with any of the other bins, hence creating 5 additional pairings
involving an antibody from each bin. Based on this, 10 combinations covering all non-competitive
bins (except for antibodies from Bin D and F) were tested to identify antibodies that can be paired
together in an antibody cocktail. Of the 10 combinations tested, only two combinations showed
moderate synergy while 2 combinations were additive, and 6 combinations were antagonistic
(Table 1). Importantly, ION_300 (a non-ACE2 blocker) from Bin G paired well with antibodies
from other bins and was part of the two combinations that showed moderate synergy.

Biophysical characterisation of early-stage therapeutic candidates is important to identify any
associated liabilities or risks that may hinder the progression of an antibody towards Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) (15). Although the functional binding properties set the
threshold for progressing antibodies into preclinical and clinal development, good thermal,
physical and chemical properties (collectively known as “developability” properties) are all
required to ensure they can be produced at scale with minimal loss and are tractable as a potential
human drug. Sub-optimal developability properties can cause poor in vivo efficacy, PK/PD and
immunogenicity leading to expensive late-stage clinical failures or high costs of manufacturing
(16, 17). Therefore, the final panel of neutralising antibodies were subjected to a series of
experiments to determine the developability profile (see Supplementary Materials). This includes
a pH stress test (to mimic the virus inactivation step during manufacturing), thermal stress test,
freeze-thaw test, fragmentation analysis using CE-SDS, purity and column interaction test using
HPLC-SEC, propensity for self-aggregation using AC-SINS and determination of isoelectric
points using capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF). 13 out of 21 (60%) antibodies passed the cut-off
values for each assay and were hence deemed developable (Table S5). This represents an attrition

of developability testing as part of early antibody drug discovery.

Crystal structures of ACE-2 blocking and non-blocking antibodies in complex with RBD

To understand and characterise the molecular basis of viral inhibition, we determined the
crystal structure of the potent ACE2 blocking ION_360 bound to RBD and of the complementary
non-receptor competitive ION_300 in complex with RBD. The structure of the ION_360-SARSCoV-2 RBD complex was determined at 2.80 Å. Consistent with its antiviral potency, ION_360
binds to the ACE2 receptor binding motif (RBM) on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which is a feature
reported for a number of antiviral antibodies (10, 18). Examples of key interactions seen between
the ION_360 antibody and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are illustrated in Fig. 4A and Fig. S5.

To determine the mechanism of viral neutralisation of the non-ACE2 blocking antibody
ION_300, the structure of the ION_300-SARS-CoV-2 RBD complex was solved by protein
crystallography to 2.35 Å. Our structure revealed that the ION_300 interface with the RBD is
predominantly through the VH domain, burying 647 Å2 of antibody surface, compared to only 27
Å2 for the VK domain. All three CDR loops from the VH domain contribute at least three residues
to the interface, whereas only two residues from the V K domain are involved, with a total of 19
residues across both domains losing at least 10 Å2 of solvent accessibility following binding. The
contact surface involves seven aromatic residues from ION_300 CDR loops, three of which are
central to CDRH3 interactions (Tyr103, Tyr104, Tyr105), as well as seven hydrogen bonds and
two salt bridges. An illustration of the RBD:ION_300 interface is shown in Fig. 4A and 4B. The
structure of the complex reveals that ION_300 binds away from the receptor binding motif

recognised by ACE2 on the RBD and against the exposed ß-pleated sheet, particularly impacting
on residues K462-S469 immediately following the ß1’ strand.

It is important to note that the epitope identified for ION_300 is distinct from all current
published anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Fig. S6). There is a very limited overlap with the epitope
of Fab 52 (PDB: 7k9z (19)), which contacts the backside of the RBM, whereas ION_300 shows
no contact with the RBM. Furthermore, the most prevalent recorded mutations, V367F, N439K,
Y453F, S477N, V483A (20), and the N501Y mutation associated with the recent virulent strain
(B.1.1.7 lineage) identified in the UK, are not found within the epitope of ION_300 and are
consequently considered highly unlikely to affect the antiviral potency of this antibody.

Structural alignment of the RBD from the ION_300 complex with the RBD from the ACE2
complex (PDB:6m0j) reveals very limited conformational differences, with an overall rmsd of
0.76 Å when aligning all Ca atoms, strongly suggesting that the antiviral mechanism of action of
ION_300 is not allosteric. Furthermore, in reported cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein, the ION_300 epitope on the RBD is buried behind the NTD of an adjacent S1 polypeptide
chain when the RBD is in the closed conformation. The ION_300 binding site only becomes
accessible when the RBD is in the open conformation (Fig. 4C), indicating that binding of this
antibody may result in a spike protein which is locked in an RBD open type conformation. This
perhaps suggests that ION_300 may utilise a similar ratcheting mechanism to that proposed by
David Veesler’s Group (21-23), in which the open/closed equilibrium of the spike protein, with
regard to the RBD, is pushed to a fully open conformation following antibody binding. Such
changes may cause a premature adoption of a post-fusion spike conformation, ultimately resulting

in the inhibition of virus entry into host cells. Alternatively, steric hindrance or aggregation of
virions via bivalent crosslinking of spike trimer could also contribute to viral neutralisation
function of ION_300 (12).

RBD-binding antibodies arise from recent B cell activation and correlate with patient
status
The BCR repertoire sequence data from these patients has been previously published (24),
yielding 3,485,995 unique VH sequences across all patients. To investigate the B cell responses of
the patients in more detail, the sequence data from the 254 unique RBD-binding antibodies isolated
by phage display were integrated with the total BCR repertoire data (Fig. 1). Co-clustering of the
two datasets was performed using a previously described threshold (see Methods) to group
together sequences that are sufficiently similar to be considered part of the same B cell clonal
expansion, and likely targeting the same epitope. This clustering yielded 838,887 clusters across
all of the patients; these clusters were then labelled according to whether they contained any of the
RBD-binding antibodies identified from the phage-display process. Of the 254 unique RBDbinding antibodies, 201 of these co-clustered with the total BCR sequence data. Several of these
201 antibodies mapped to the same cluster, resulting in 89 different clusters that could then be
annotated as RBD-binding. 108 of the 201 RBD binding antibodies also showed >30% neutralising
activity in the pseudoviral neutralisation assay (at 25 nM), enabling 49/89 of the RBD-binding
clusters to also be annotated as containing neutralising antibodies.

The mean size of all clusters across patients was 4 sequences, but the clusters annotated as
containing RBD-binding or neutralising antibodies contained on average 116 and 63 sequences

respectively, indicating that these B cells are undergoing clonal expansion (Fig. 5A). Investigating
the isotype subclass distributions of the sequences within these clusters showed different
distributions for total clusters, clusters annotated as RBD-binding, and clusters annotated as RBD
binding and neutralising (a subset of RBD binders that neutralise the virus, Fig. 5B). 71% of RBDbinding clusters, and 80% of neutralising clusters contained IgM sequences, indicating recent
activation of these B cells. Furthermore, calculating the mean mutation from germline of the
sequences within the clusters showed that the RBD-binding and neutralising clusters had fewer
mutations than total clusters (RBD-binding: 2.6, Neutralising: 2.2, Total: 7.6), giving further
evidence that the RBD-binding and neutralising clusters have arisen from recently activated B
cells (Fig. 5C).
Looking at total clusters, there is a bimodal distribution of mutation counts, which becomes
more pronounced when considering the clusters that do not contain IgM sequences (Fig. S7A),
and those with evidence for clonal expansion (Fig. S7B). We interpret the first mode of the
distribution to represent naïve or recently activated B cells, and the second mode to represent
memory B cells. By cutting this bimodal distribution at 5, we classified whether the RBD-binding
clusters had arisen from a naïve response (<5 mutations), or memory recall (>= 5 mutations). In
total, 88% of the RBD-binding clusters, and 90% of the neutralising clusters were classified as
having arisen from recent activation. We can thus conclude that the response to COVID-19 is
largely driven by naïve B cell activation, and there is very little re-activation of circulating memory
cells.
Next, the number of clusters annotated as either RBD-binding or neutralising was
calculated independently for each patient. There were no RBD-binding clusters identified in the
one deteriorating patient (Fig. 5D), but at least one identified in every stable and improving patient.

There were significant differences in the number of both RBD-binding and neutralising clusters
identified between each of the three patient groups. There were more RBD-binding and
neutralising clusters identified in the improving compared to the stable, and the stable compared
to the deteriorating groups. Improving patients therefore provide the best source for therapeutic
antibody discovery; the deteriorating patients may have yet to mount an effective immune
response.

The antibody response to COVID-19 is highly convergent
We and others have previously observed a stereotypic BCR response to COVID-19
infection (24). We replicate the findings here, showing that the clusters annotated as RBD-binding
use a restricted set of V gene segments (Fig. S8). Clusters utilising VH3-30, VH3-53, VH3-66,
VH3-9 and VH5-51 dominated the response, with lower levels of VH1-18, VH1-2, VH1-49, VH169, VH3-11, VH3-13, VH3-15, VH3-20, VH3-23, VH3-48, VH3-64 and VH3-7 also seen. Heavy
and light chain V gene utilisation among the RBD binders identified from phage display screening
is shown in Fig. S9.
We have now extended these observations by investigating the specific convergence
between individuals of the clusters annotated as RBD-binding or neutralising. Of the 89 clusters
annotated as RBD-binding, 26% (23/89) of the RDB binders and 33% (16/49) of the neutralising
clusters were convergent across at least 2 individuals. This is in stark contrast to the convergence
seen across the entire dataset which is 2.5% of total clusters. Furthermore, one of the RBD-binding
and neutralising clusters was shared between 14 of the 18 different individuals in the study (Cluster
ID 3, Table 2.1). Interestingly, the moderately neutralising non-ACE2 blocking antibodies were

also abundant and convergent with one clonally expanded cluster (size = 128) recurring among 7
individuals.
In addition to investigating the convergence between individuals in the current study, we
also investigated the convergence with SARS-CoV-1/2 binding antibodies identified in other
studies. We extracted all VH sequences from the CoV-AbDab (25) annotated as having a humanderived V gene segment, and having V and J gene segment annotations, and CDRH3 sequence
determined. This yielded 1,051 unique sequences. These sequences were then also integrated into
the clustering analysis of phage-derived RBD-binding and neutralising antibodies, and the total
BCR repertoire data. In total, 112 of the clusters in the total BCR repertoire contained antibodies
that had been extracted from the CoV-AbDab, showing that convergence is seen between studies.
Furthermore, there were six clusters which contained both antibodies from the CoV-AbDab and
antibodies from the current study (Table 2.1). All of these clusters were classified as having arisen
from recent activation based on having <5 mean mutations, and the presence of IgM sequences.
These clusters were all convergent between at least three individuals in the current study. Two of
these clusters (Cluster ID1 and Cluster ID2) were also convergent between nine individuals in this
study, as well as three separate studies from the CoV-AbDab. Both of these clusters were in the
panel of the 21 most potent antibodies discovered in the current study. For example, antibodies
ION_312 and ION_1000, were highly similar to a clonally expanded sequence cluster (containing
1680 unique sequences, Cluster ID1, Table 2.1) from 9 different patients in this study and
antibodies from 4 separate studies (Table 2.2), indicating its importance in mediating protection.

Discussion

We have previously described (24) B cell receptor repertoire analysis of the VH populations
from 18 SARS-CoV-2 positive donors at an acute stage of disease. In the present study we have
constructed libraries from the antibody repertoire of these patients and used phage display to
identify a sub-set of antibody genes which encode functional binders and potent neutralisers of
SARS-CoV-2. Unlike most direct B cell screening methods, phage display technology allows
processing of millions of antibody genes from large numbers of patient donors. It also allows
enrichment of functional clones that may be rare or have not yet undergone clonal expansion within
the initial antibody response. This deep mining approach yielded neutralisers to diverse epitopes
within the RBD. This includes a group of highly potent antibodies which compete with ACE2 for
RBD binding, with neutralisation IC50s matching the best antibodies reported with similar
mechanism of action (5, 7, 8, 26, 27).

Another group included antibodies with moderate potencies which neutralised the virus
through a distinct mechanism of action (independent of inhibiting the RBD-ACE2 interaction)
including an antibody to a unique epitope (ION_300). Despite their relatively weaker potency,
non-ACE2 blocking neutralisers were abundant within the clonally expanded patient antibody
response with strong convergence scores, indicating that such antibodies also play a key role in
providing protection. The crystal structure of ION_300 revealed that it binds to a unique epitope
at the opposite side of the RBM. Identification of contact residues within the epitope suggest that
it is likely to retain binding to widely circulating RBD mutations including the N501Y mutation
that is predicted to enhance the infectivity of the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage.
In addition, this antibody paired well with potent antibodies from ACE2-competing epitope bins

to impart synergy (albeit moderate), providing a compelling case for inclusion in an antibody
cocktail for in vivo evaluation or further potency maturation.

Sequence analysis of the selected functional binders from this study shows that many of
the potent antibodies are identical to, or within a few amino acids of, germline encoded V and J
sequences. This is in line with previous reports from Kreer et al, who describe isolation of
neutralising IgG antibodies with a spectrum of variable domains with low levels of somatic
mutation derived from memory B cells (28). Projection of the sequences of the confirmed RBD
binders and neutralisers identified in this study onto a dataset derived from the same patient group
including VHs from both IgG and IgM populations, confirms that a number of these potent
neutralisers (originally selected from the IgG pool) are in fact represented in the IgM repertoire.
Thus, the occurrence at an early stage of infection of relatively unmutated V H genes within both
IgM and IgG populations is indicative of recently class-switched B cells that have yet to go
undergo somatic hypermutation.

By combining the identification of highly potent neutralising antibodies with deep
sequencing we highlight convergence within the antibody response among different patients within
this study group and beyond. The occurrence of a convergent antibody response among COVID19 patients is described to a lesser extent by other studies. Robbiani et. al. purified IgG-expressing,
RBD-binding memory B cells from a limited number of convalescent COVID-19 patients (n=6)
at an average of 39 days post-symptom onset (29). Analysis of the antibody genes revealed the
presence of closely related antibodies in different individuals at this later time point in the memory
pool. Here, we show evidence of recurring antibody genes within the total antibody pool (including
the IgM repertoire) of 18 patients and also among the published anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

sequences from multiple independent studies, including one of the most convergent sequences
from Robbiani et al (Table 2.2).

Convergent antibody responses have been described in the response to other infectious
diseases (30-32), but to our knowledge, the extreme level of convergence in the COVID-19
response has not been reported in other disease settings. The occurrence of potent neutralising
antibodies within the germline encoded naïve repertoire may be part of the explanation. The high
convergence of specific BCR sequences in COVID-19 that have protective properties suggests that
developing these into antibody therapeutics could be highly effective. Monitoring for the
development of these sequences may also be used as a generic method for assessing efficacy of
novel vaccine strategies.

The majority of characterised antibodies from these patient derived libraries had affinities
in the range of 1-30 nM, which is typical of antibodies isolated from IgM-derived naïve phage
display repertoires (33-35) and did not show any strong correlation with neutralisation potency.
The ability of a naïve-like antibody response with moderate binding affinities to impart highly
potent viral neutralisation could be rationalised by the avid binding of bivalent IgGs to the trimeric
spike protein (the main target of neutralising antibodies reported here or elsewhere). The
importance of valency in neutralisation is demonstrated by the comparison of neutralisation IC 50s
of IgGs and Fabs (Fig. 3C).

While the devastating effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the population is clear to see, this study
clearly demonstrates the presence of potent neutralising antibodies within the armoury of the naïve
repertoire protecting the majority of the population. This readiness may be explained by the

presentation of antibodies effecting potent neutralisation of polyvalent targets.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant antigen and control antibodies
For expression of the RBD subdomain of the SARS-CoV-1 (residues Arg306 to Phe527)
and SARS-CoV-2 (residues Arg319 to Phe541) spike protein and human ACE2, genes encoding
the proteins were synthesised and cloned upstream of either an Fc tag or rCD4-Avi tag, both with
an additional 6 x His tag in mammalian expression vectors (37). The constructs were expressed in
Expi293FTM cells (Thermo Fisher, A14527) and purified by affinity chromatography using NickelNTA agarose (Invitrogen, R90115). SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein with a His tag (S1N-C52H3) and
SARS-CoV-2 S protein active trimer with His tag (SPN-C52H8) were separately purchased from
ACRO biosystems. MERS-CoV S1 with a His tag was purchased from Sino Biological (40069V08H).
All antigens with an Avi tag were biotinylated enzymatically using BirA biotin-protein
ligase (Avidity, Bulk BirA) while non-Avi tagged antigens were biotinylated chemically using EZLink Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Fisher, A39256). VH and VL sequences of SARS-CoV-2 control
antibodies (COV2-2196, COV2-2130, S309, B38, H4, and CR3022) were obtained from the CoVAbDab database (25) and cloned into pINT3/pINT54 IgG expression vectors (4) as synthetic gene
fragments. The antibodies were expressed using the Expi293TM system and purified using ProteinA affinity chromatography (Generon, PC-A100). Control antibody SAD-S35 was purchased from
ACRO biosystems.

Sample collection and total RNA preparation
Peripheral blood was obtained from a subset of 18 patients who were admitted to medical
wards at Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK with acute COVID-19 pneumonia, after informed
consent by the direct care team. Blood collection and processing, followed by total RNA
preparation, was carried out as previously described (24). RNA was split for use in both
construction of phage libraries (see Supplementary Materials) and BCR sequencing.
Phage display panning, subcloning and high throughput IgG expression
The hybrid and fully patient derived libraries (see Supplementary Materials) were
subjected to three rounds of phage display selections against biotinylated RBD-Fc-His, RBDrCD4-Avi-His, and S1-His were carried out as previously described (2). The first and second
rounds used selection antigen concentrations of 50 nM and 5 nM respectively. In the third round,
each selection was performed at two selection antigen concentrations, 0.25 nM and 0.05 nM.
Antibody genes were isolated from the third-round selection populations and sub-cloned into the
pINT3 and pINT54 IgG1 mammalian expression vectors (4). Transfection-quality plasmid DNA
was prepared for 1498 clones in 96 well plate format (Biobasic, BS415). The DNA was then
expressed by transient transfection in Expi293FTM cells (Thermo Fisher, A14527) in 96 well plates
at 700 µl/well scale.
Primary screening and sequencing
An affinity capture assay was performed as the initial screening of the 1,498 expressed
IgGs. The assay was performed as described elsewhere (3) using 1 nM biotinylated RBD-rCD4His or S1-His. VHs and VLs were sequenced using Eurofins Genomics and Genewiz Sanger
sequencing services. To identify unique combinations of heavy CDR3 and light CDR3, antibody

frameworks and CDR regions were annotated and analysed using Geneious Biologics
(Biomatters).
SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 blocking assay
Black 96-well immune plates (Thermo Scientific, 10030581) were coated with mouse antirCD4 antibody (Bio-Rad, MCA1022R) at 4 °C overnight. The following day, plates were blocked
with 3% (w/v) milk powder (Marvel) in PBS, before incubation with purified recombinant SARSCoV-2 RBD-rCD4-His (1.25 µg/mL) for 1 hour. To identify antibodies that could block the
interaction between RBD and ACE2, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were pre-incubated with 2
nM of recombinant ACE2-Fc-His-Biotin for 30 minutes before transferring to the RBD-coated
plates. The IgGs and ACE2 were incubated in the plates for 1 hour and ACE2-Fc-Biotin was
detected by DELFIA Eu-N1 Streptavidin (Perkin Elmer, 1244-360) using the DELFIA-TRF
system (Perkin Elmer).
SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV cross-reactivity assay
Black 96-well immune plates (Thermo Scientific, 10030581) were coated with SARSCoV-1 RBD-rCD4-His or SARS-CoV-2 RBD-rCD4-His or MERS-CoV S1-His (Sino Biological,
40069-V08H), at 3 µg/mL, at 4 °C overnight. The following day, plates were blocked with 3 %
(w/v) milk powder (Marvel) in PBS before incubation with purified IgGs (2 µg/mL) for 1 hour.
Bound IgG was detected with Eu-N1 Anti-Human IgG (Perkin Elmer, 1244-330). using DELFIATRF system (Perkin Elmer).

Neutralisation assays and combination testing
Briefly, a lentiviral pseudotyped virus was used for the infection of HEK293T/17 cells
transiently expressing human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 for the pseudoviral assay. The SARS-CoV-2
Australia/VIC01/2020 isolate (Centre For AIDS Reagents cat. no. 100980) was used to infect
VERO CCL-81 cells for the authentic virus neutralisation assay. The Combination Indexes (CI)
for the antibody combinations were calculated using CompuSyn based on Chou-Talaley method
(39, 40). See Supplementary Materials for detailed methods.
Epitope binning and affinity measurement
The epitope binning of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs was carried out using Octect BioLayer
interferometry using the classical sandwich format (Fig. S4). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
experiments were performed using the Sierra SPR-32 instrument (Bruker). 1:1 binding kinetics (at
25oC) were determined by flowing different concentration of monomeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD over
antibodies immobilised on biosensor chips. See Supplementary Materials for detailed methods.
Expression and purification
For medium scale expression for detailed characterisation, all antibodies were expressed at
50 ml scale in ExpiCHO or Expi293 system (Thermo Fisher). Expressed antibodies were purified
using protein-A affinity chromatography (by HiTrap Fibro PrismA unit, Cytiva, 17549855)
followed by size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad Superdex 200 16/600, Cytiva, 28-9893-35).

For single concentration pseudovirus assay, SPR, and cross-reactivity evaluation, the
antibodies expressed in 96 well plates (Expi293 cells) were purified by protein-A affinity
chromatography (Generon, PC-A100), using 96 well filter plates (Whatman Polystyrene Unifilter

Microplates, GE Healthcare, 11313535). After purification, antibodies were buffer exchanged into
PBS using Zeba™ Spin Desalting Plates, 7K MWCO (ThermoFisher Scientific, 89807).
B cell receptor repertoire sequencing
Three different VH sequence datasets were integrated for analysis: 1) The V H sequence data
from the antibodies isolated in the present study using phage display, 2) the B cell receptor
repertoire VH sequence data generated from the same patients and previously published (24) and
3) all VH sequences in CoV-AbDab [accessed 28th August 2020] annotated as having a humanderived V gene segment, and having V and J gene segment annotations, and CDRH3 sequence
determined.
Each sequence from the combined dataset was processed using IgBlast (42) to determine
V and J germline gene segment usage, and locations of the CDRs and FWRs. Mutation count was
determined by the number of mismatches between the sequence and its inferred germline using
the shazam R package (43). For dataset 2, the isotype of each sequence was possible to determine
by comparison to germline constant region sequences. For datasets 1 and 3, this information was
not available.
Sequences were clustered into groups using a previously described algorithm (24). This is
a greedy clustering algorithm, run with a threshold requiring sequences within a cluster to have
the same V and J gene segment, and no more than 1 AA mismatch per 10 AAs in the CDRH3.
This threshold has been previously shown to group together sequences that are sufficiently similar
to be considered part of the same B cell clonal expansion, and likely targeting the same epitope.
The cluster centre is defined as the most common sequence within the cluster. All datasets, and all
samples within each dataset were clustered together to identify overlap between the datasets.

Protein expression and purification for crystallography studies
The Fab fragments for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies ION_300 and ION_360 and SARSCoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) were expressed in Expi293FTM cells (Thermo Fisher,
A14527). The antibody:RBD complexes were mixed and co-purified by size exclusion
chromatography in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl. For crystallisation, antibody:RBD
complex samples were concentrated to 5-10 mg/mL.
Crystallization, structure determination, and refinement
All crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion method at 19oC, by mixing equal volumes
of protein plus well solution. The RBD:ION_300 crystals grew in 16% PEG3350 and 0.3 M
potassium citrate tribasic, whereas crystals of RBD:ION_360 crystals grew in 16% PEG3350 and
0.2 M ammonium citrate tribasic. For cryoprotection, crystals were generally transferred to a
solution of mother liquor plus 22% ethylene glycol. Data sets were collected at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble (beamline ID30A1 (MASSIF-1)). Data from crystals of
RBD:ION_300 and RBD:ION_360 were refined to 2.35 and 2.80 Å resolution, respectively. Data
were processed using XDS (44) and AIMLESS from the CCP4 Suite (45). Cell parameters and
data statistics are summarized in Table S6.
Both complex crystal structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser (46)
utilising the coordinates from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain (PDB: 7JMP) and using homology
models for ION_300 and ION_360 antibodies generated using SWISSMODEL (47) to model the
heavy and light chains. Atomic models were built using Coot (48) and refined with Refmac (49).
All structures were solved by molecular replacement and are reported with final Rwork/Rfree values
below 20/25% with good stereochemistry (Table S6.).

Fig. 1. Overview of SARS-CoV-2 antibody discovery and analysis of patient response to
COVID-19. Antibody genes isolated from the PBMC’s of 18 COVID-19 patients were used to
for B cell receptor repertoire sequencing and to construct phage display libraries.
Characterization of phage display derived antibodies using high throughput expression, primary
binding assay and biochemical ACE-2 receptor blocking assays and DNA sequencing resulted in

10

testing of 155 unique antibodies for pseudovirus neutralization and surface plasmon resonance.
A final panel of 21 antibodies were subjected to authentic virus neutralization, epitope binding
and developability assessment. Finally, structures of a complementary pair of antibodies with
two different mechanism of viral neutralisation in complex with RBD were determined using Xray crystallography. The VH sequences of RBD binding and pseudoviral neutralising antibodies

15

were co-clustered with whole BCR repertoire sequencing from the patients and published
antibodies to understand the nature and dynamics of the early antibody response. Figure was
prepared using BioRender.

Table 1. Effect of antibody combinations in the neutralisation of authentic SARS-CoV2. Each antibody in the combinations listed was tested individually or at 1:1 ratio with the
pairing antibody in the authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay. The Combination Index (CI)
for each antibody pair was calculated with CompuSyn (39, 40). Based on the recommended cut10

off values by CompuSyn, CI values <0.9 indicates synergy (in bold); 0.9<CI<1.1 indicate
additive effect; CI>1.1 indicates antagonism. Antibody pair ION_351 and ION_354 from
overlapping bins (A and C) was used as negative control for the assay.

Table 2. Convergent clusters identified in the current study which also had sequences map to them
from the CoV-AbDab (Table 2.1). This table shows the properties of convergent antibody clusters
identified from the current study, including the size of the cluster (i.e. unique antibodies found in
each cluster, an indicator of clonal expansion), number of different patients each cluster was
10

present in (convergence) and number of antibodies found in the CoV-AbDab database with the
same cluster identity. Convergence of antibody sequences across separate studies (Table 2.2).
Heavy CDR3 sequence similarity (>80%), V gene, J gene usage shown between antibodies
identified within the current study to those in separate published studies.
