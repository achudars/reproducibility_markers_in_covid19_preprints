Abstract

20

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a genome

21

comprised of a ~30K nucleotides non-segmented, positive single-stranded RNA. Although its

22

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase exhibits exonuclease proofreading activity, viral sequence

23

diversity can be induced by replication errors and host factors. These variations can be observed

24

in the population of viral sequences isolated from infected host cells and are not necessarily

25

reflected in the genome of transmitted founder viruses. We profiled intra-sample genetic diversity

26

of SARS-CoV-2 variants using 15,289 high-throughput sequencing datasets from infected

27

individuals and infected cell lines. Most of the genetic variations observed, including C->U and

28

G->U, were consistent with errors due to heat-induced DNA damage during sample processing,

29

and/or sequencing protocols. Despite high mutational background, we confidently identified intra-

30

variable positions recurrent in the samples analyzed, including several positions at the end of the

31

gene encoding the viral S protein. Notably, most of the samples possesses a C->A missense

32

mutation resulting in the S protein lacking the last 20 amino acids (S20). Here we demonstrate

33

that S20 exhibits increased cell-to-cell fusion and syncytia formations. Our findings are

34

suggestive of the consistent emergence of high-frequency viral quasispecies that are not

35

horizontally transmitted but involved in intra-host infection and spread.

assay, we observed that this truncated spike protein displays an elevated fusogenic potential and

forms syncytia. Given the high frequency at which this mutation independently arises across

various samples, it can be hypothesized that this deletion mutation provides a selective advantage

to viral replication and may also have a role in pathogenesis in humans.

Introduction

51

Observed for the first time in 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

52

(SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease, COVID-19, has caused significant worldwide mortality

53

and unprecedented economic burden. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a genome

54

comprised of a ~30K nucleotides non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (vRNA)

55

[1,2]. The virus is composed of four main structural proteins, encoded at the last 3’ terminal third

56

of the viral genome: the spike glycoprotein (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid

57

(N) [3–5]. Attachment to the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is mediated

58

by the S protein expressed on the surface of the virion [6]. Following its association, the S protein

59

is cleaved into two separate polypeptides (S1 and S2), which triggers the fusion of the viral particle

60

with the cellular membrane [7,8]. Once inside a cell, its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),

61

which is encoded in the first open reading frame of the viral genome [9], carries out transcription

62

and replication of the vRNA genome. In addition, mRNAs coding for the structural proteins (e.g.,

63

S, M, E and N) are expressed by subgenomic RNAs [9]. Once translated, the S, M and E proteins

64

localize and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)

65

[10]. The S protein possesses an endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (ERRS) at its carboxy

66

terminus, which is required for this localization [11]. At this location, the N protein associates with

67

the viral genome and assembles into virions, which are transported along the endosomal network

68

and released by exocytosis [9]. It was also observed for several coronaviruses that the S protein

69

can localize to the cell surface and mediate cell fusion between adjacent cells, producing

70

multinucleated cells or syncytia [8,12,13].

71

Genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 vRNA from infected populations has demonstrated

72

genetic heterogeneity [14–20]. Several recurrent mutations have been identified in consensus

73

sequences, and the geographical distribution of clades was established. Because they induce an

74

abundance of missense rather than synonymous or non-sense mutations, it was suggested that

75

regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome were actively evolving and might contribute to pandemic

76

spreading [20]. It was observed that variations are mainly comprised of transition mutations

77

(purine->purine or pyrimidine->pyrimidine) with a prevalence of C->U transitions and might

78

occur within a sequence context reminiscent of APOBEC-mediated deamination (i.e.,

79

[AU]C[AU]; [21,22]). Consequently, it was proposed that host editing enzymes might be involved

80

in coronavirus genome editing [23,24].

81

Consensus mutations are only part of the genetic landscape in regard to RNA viruses.

82

Replication of RNA viruses typically produces quasispecies in which the viral RNA genomes do

83

not exist as single sequence entity but as a population of genetic variants [25]. These mutations

84

are most frequently caused by the error-prone nature of each of their respective viral RdRps and

85

by host RNA editing enzymes, such as APOBECs and ADARs [26]. However, the RdRp complex

86

of large RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, sometimes possess exonuclease proofreading

87

activity, and consequently have lower error rates [25,27]. Quasispecies may sometimes exhibit

88

diminished replicative fitness or deleterious mutations and exert different roles that are not directly

89

linked to viral genomic propagation [28]. Mutations that form the intra-host genetic spectrum have

90

been shown to help viruses evade cytotoxic T cell recognition and neutralizing antibodies and also

91

render viruses more resistant to antiviral drugs [28]. These mutations can also be involved in

92

modulating the virulence and transmissibility of the quasispecies [28].

93

In this study, we focussed on assessing intra-genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2. We

94

analyzed high-throughput sequencing datasets to profile the sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2

95

variants within distinct sample populations. We observed high genetic intra-variability of the viral

96

genome. By comparing variation profiles between samples from different donors and cell lines,

97

we identified highly conserved subspecies that independently and recurrently arose in different

98

datasets and, therefore, in different individuals. We further analyzed the dominant variant S20 in

99

a functional assay and demonstrate that this truncated spike protein enhances syncytium formation.

100

Here we provide evidence for the existence of a consistently emerging variant identified across

101

geographical regions that may influence intra-host SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and pathogenicity.

Results

104

High intra-genetic variability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in infected individuals.

105

To assess the extent of SARS-CoV-2 sequence intra-genetic variability, we analyzed

106

15,224 publicly available high-throughput sequencing datasets from infected individuals. The raw

107

sequencing reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome, and

108

the composition of each nucleotide at each position on the viral genome was generated. Consensus

109

sequences were produced for each dataset and the nucleotide composition for each position were

110

compared to respective consensuses. To reduce the number of variations due to amplification bias

111

and sequencing errors, duplicated reads were combined, and only positions mapped with a

112

sequencing depth of 50 reads and having at least 5 reads with variations compared to the sample

113

consensus were considered. Overall, we identified 301,742 variations from 11,362 samples located

114

on 26,113 positions of the 29,903 nt SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed an average of 26.6+/-

115

132.0 variable nucleotides per sample (ranging from 1 to 5295 variations/sample; Fig 1A).

117

Analysis of the type of intra-genetic variations present in SARS-CoV-2 samples from infected

118

individuals.

119

The analysis of the type of nucleotide changes within samples revealed that 52.2% were

120

transitions (either purine->purine or pyrimidine->pyrimidine) and 47.8% were transversions

121

(purine->pyrimidine or pyrimidine->purine). Notably, the highest nucleotide variations

122

corresponded to C->U transitions (43.5%) followed by G->U (28.1%) transversion (Fig 1B), both

123

types encompassing 71.6% of all variations. Since editing by host enzymes depends on the

124

sequence context, we extracted two nucleotides upstream and downstream from each genomic

125

position corresponding to variations and generated sequence logos. Our results indicated a high

126

number of As and Us around all variation types and sites (62.1+/-3.4%; Fig 1B). Because SARS-

127

CoV-2 is composed of 62% A/U, this suggests the observed number of As and Us around variation

128

sites are mainly due to the A/U content of the viral genome, that no motifs are enriched around

129

these sites and that these intra-genetic variations are likely not originating from host editing

130

enzymes.

Identification of recurrent genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from infected

134

To identify biologically relevant intra-genetic variations, we examined the variable

135

positions that are recurrent in the samples analyzed. The variable positions were tabulated for each

136

sample and then recurrent intra-genetic variations were calculated as percentages of samples

137

containing variation at each position. Most variations are distributed homogeneously on the viral

138

genome and most are poorly shared amongst samples (Fig 1C and 1D). However, our analysis

139

reveals 15 recurrent intra-variations shared by at least 5% of the samples analyzed (Fig 1C, above

140

blue line; Table 1). Amongst these, four transversions (at nt 25,324, 25,334, 25,336 and 25,337)

141

located at the 3’ end of the S gene are the most recurrent variations (inset of Fig 1C and Table 1).

142

Three of these transversions (at nt 25,334, 25,336 and 25,337) correspond to missense mutations:

143

E1258D (46.4%), E1258Q (27.6%) and D1259H (20.1%). Interestingly the most observed

144

variation (at nt 25,324) is shared by 58.7% of the samples (6,668 of the 11,362 samples) and

145

corresponds to a C->A transversion producing a nonsense mutation at amino acid 1,254 of the S

146

protein (Fig 1C and 1D, red line; Fig 2B, red rectangle). The resulting S protein lacks the last 20

147

amino acids (S20), which includes the ERRS motif at its carboxy terminus (Fig 2B, white letters

148

on a black background). Amongst the sample with this intra-genetic variation, this C->A

149

transversion represents from 2.9% to 42.4% of the subspecies identified (mean or 8.2+/-2.9%; Fig

150

2C and Table 1).

Analysis of intra-genetic variations present in SARS-CoV-2 samples from infected cells.

158

To further investigate variations in a more controlled system, and to determine whether

159

host proteins are involved in SARS-CoV-2 genome editing, we used 65 high-throughput

160

sequencing datasets generated in a recent transcription profiling study of several cell lines infected

161

with SARS-CoV-2 [29]. Firstly, we mapped raw sequencing reads to the human genome to assess

162

host modifying enzyme expression. For all cell lines, normalized counts for mRNAs corresponding

163

to most host modifying enzymes were very low or non-detected (Fig 3), suggesting that these cell

164

lines poorly expressed these host editing proteins. As above, the raw sequencing reads from

165

infected cells were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, the composition of each

166

nucleotide at each position on the viral genome were generated, and nucleotide variations when

167

compared to respective consensus sequences were calculated. Because the sequencing depths of

168

the samples were low, we considered positions mapped by at least 20 reads and having at least 2

169

reads with variation compared to the sample consensus. In the samples derived from infected cells,

170

we observed 29.7% and 70.3% of transitions and transversions, respectively. Similar to

171

observations in samples from infected individuals, the highest nucleotide variations corresponded

172

to G->U transversions (26.1%) and C->U (21.6%) transitions (Fig 4B). We then analyzed

173

nucleotide compositions two nucleotides upstream and downstream of the intra-genetic variations.

174

As above, a high number of A/U (57.8+/-7.7%) were present around sites showing variation (Fig

175

4B), consistent with the 62% A/U composition of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, indicating no

176

enrichment of sequence motifs around these sites, except for the expected high number of As and

177

Us.

178

We then examined the intra-genetic variable positions that are recurrent amongst the cell

179

lines analyzed. We identified 29 positions within the viral populations showing intra-genetic

180

variation enrichment in at least 10% of the cell cultures and most of them are located on structural

181

genes, which are encoded at the last 3’ terminal third of the viral genome (Fig 4C and 4D). Similar

182

to our observation from the samples from infected individuals, a cluster of recurrent variations is

183

located at the 3’end of the S gene, including the C->A transversion at position 25,324 shared in

184

58.9% of the cell lines analyzed (Fig 4C and 4D, red line; Table 2). Overall, our results indicate

185

consistent results between intra-genetic variations observed in infected cell lines and in samples

186

from infected individuals, including the presence the viral subspecies resulting in a S protein

187

truncated of its last 20 amino acids (S20).

SARS-CoV-2 S20 increases cell-to-cell fusion and the size of syncytia.

195

For several coronaviruses, the S protein mediates syncytia formation [8,12,13]. To

196

investigate the effect of S20 on cell-to-cell fusion, HEK293T cells stably expressing human

ACE2 were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP and plasmids expressing or not wild-

198

type S or S20 under a cytomegalovirus (CMV) major immediate early promoter. As expected, in

199

the absence of the S protein (i.e., pCAGGS alone) syncytia formation was not observed (Fig 5A).

200

Consistent with previous findings [8], we observed the presence of large cytoplasmic masses

201

containing GFP in the presence of the wild-type S protein, indicating induction of cell-to-cell

202

fusion (Fig 5A and 5B). Our results not only indicate that S20 also induces fusion, but that the

203

cytoplasmic masses are larger than the wild-type S protein (Fig 5A and 5B). To complement this

204

approach, we quantified cell fusion using a bi-molecular fluorescence complementation (BiFc)

205

assay composed of target cells containing GCN4 leucine zipper-Venus1 (ZipV1) with or without

206

myc-ACE2, and effector cells containing GCN4 leucine zipper-Venus2 (ZipV2) with or without

207

S/ S20 (Fig 5C). Two hours after incubating the two cell populations, we observed an increase

208

in fluorescence signal in the presence of wild-type S and ACE2, indicating fluorescence

209

complementation and thus cell-to-cell fusion (Fig 5D). Consistent with our microscopy

210

observations, fluorescence complementation was increased in the presence of S20. Taken

211

together, our results indicate that S20 displays increased syncytia formation in HEK293T cells

212

expressing ACE2 as compared to the wild-type S protein.

Discussion

215

Previous analyses of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide variations indicated the prevalence of C->U

216

transitions suggesting that the viral genome was actively evolving and those host editing enzymes,

217

such as APOBECs and ADARs, might be involved in this process [23,24]. Although instructive

218

on the role of host involvement in SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution, these studies were performed

12

219

on consensus sequences (i.e., one per sample) and explore only part of the genetic landscape of

220

this RNA virus. Here, we used a large number of high-throughput sequencing datasets to profile

221

the intra-sample sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants, both in infected individuals and

222

infected cell lines. We observed extensive genetic variability of the viral genome, including a high

223

number of transversions, and identified several positions with recurrent intra-variability in the

224

samples analyzed. Notably, most of the samples possessed a C->A missense mutation resulting in

225

the S protein lacking the last 20 amino acids (S20) that increases cell-to-cell fusion and syncytia

226

formations.

227

Most intra-sample variations are distributed homogeneously across the viral genome, are

228

not conserved or recurrent amongst samples, and a large number of them are C->U or G->U

229

mutations. Previous analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequence variations proposed that host editing

230

enzymes might be involved in coronavirus transition editing based on results showing that C->U

231

transitions occur within a sequence context reminiscent of APOBEC1-mediated deamination (i.e.,

232

[AU]C[AU]) [21–24]. Here, we investigated nucleotide compositions at each variation site and

233

observed a high number of As and Us around all variation types and sites. However, since the

234

SARS-CoV-2 genome is 62% A/U-rich and similar percentages of As and Us were observed

235

around all variations, we concluded that no motifs are enriched around these variations in the viral

236

subspecies analyzed. Consequently, our results cannot support that host editing enzymes are a

237

major source of these intra-sample variations.

238

Although it is possible that host RNA-editing enzyme are responsible for the occurrence

239

of some variations, C->U transitions and G->U transversions are also generally associated with

240

nucleotide deamination and oxidation, respectively [30–37]. It is common practice to thermally

241

inactivate SARS-CoV-2 samples before performing RNA extractions followed by RT-PCR and

13

242

sequencing [38]. Heating samples can form free radicals, such as 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanine (8-

243

Oxo-dG), that could cause high levels of C->A and G ->U mutations and promote the hydrolytic

244

deamination of C->U [30–33,35,37,39,40]. It was previously reported that these types of mutations

245

occur at low frequency, that they are mostly detected when sequencing is performed on only one

246

DNA strand and that they are highly variable across independent experiments [32,34].

247

Consequently, most transversions observed in our analysis are likely due to heat-induced damage,

248

RNA extraction, storage, shearing and/or RT-PCR amplification errors. However, we identified

249

several positions with intra-sample variability recurrent in several independent samples, both from

250

infected individuals and infected cells. They were detected at moderate to high frequencies,

251

ranging from 2.5% to 39.3% per sample (Table 1 and 2), and most were derived from pair-end

252

sequencing (90.7%) in which the two strands of a DNA duplex were considered. Thus, it is likely

253

that these variations are genuine and represent hot spots for SARS-CoV-2 genome intra-sample

254

variability.

255

Amongst the variable positions identified in infected cells, most of them are located at the

256

last 3’ terminal third of the viral genome. These cells were infected with a high number of viruses

257

(i.e., high multiplicity of infection; MOI) for 24h [29]. The presence of several variations at

258

positions in the region coding for the main structural proteins likely reflects that this is a region

259

with increased transcriptional activity due to the requirement of producing their encoded mRNAs

260

from sub-genomic negative-sense RNAs [9].

261

Interestingly, a cluster of variations located at the 3’end of the S gene was observed for the

262

two datasets analyzed. They correspond to four transversions located at the 3’end of the S gene

263

and are shared by a large proportion of the samples. Three of these correspond to missense

264

mutations changing the charged side chains of two amino acids (E1258D, E1258Q and D1259H).

265

Notably, most of the samples possess a variability at position 25,324 producing a nonsense

266

mutation at amino acid 1,254 of the S protein. The resulting protein lacks the last 20 amino acids

267

(S20) and thus does not include the ERRS motif at its carboxy terminus. For SARS-CoV-1, the

268

ERRS domain localizes the S protein to the ERGIC and facilitates its incorporation into virions

269

[11]. Deletion of this motif might cause the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to accumulate to the plasma

270

membrane and increase the formation of large multinucleated cells known as syncytia. Consistent

271

with these observations, our results indicate an increase in syncytia formation frequency and size

272

with S20 as compared to the complete S protein. Although the biological function of S20 is

273

unknown, it is possible that the formation of syncytia facilitates the spread of the virus directly to

274

neighboring cells. S20 might also increase virus replication, as similar mutants (S18, S19 and

275

S21) were recently reported to increase both infectivity and replication of vesicular stomatitis

276

virus (VSV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein

277

in cultured cells [41–44]. It is also tempting to suggest a link between SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis

278

and the presence of S20, since severe cases of the disease were recently linked to considerable

279

lung damage and the occurrence of syncytia [45,46].

280

Our findings indicate the presence of consistent intra-sample genetic variants of SARS-

281

CoV-2, including a recurrent sub-population of S20 variants with elevated fusogenic properties.

282

Further investigation is required to better define the extent of SARS-CoV-2 variability in infected

283

hosts and to assess the role of these subspecies in the life cycle of this virus. More importantly,

284

further studies on the presence of S20 and its link with viral pathogenicity could lead to better

285

diagnostic strategies and designer treatments for COVID-19.

Methods

288

Analysis of intra-variability within SARS-CoV-2 samples.

289

15,289 publicly available high-throughput sequencing datasets were downloaded from the

290

NCBI Sequence Read Archive (up to July 10, 2020). They comprise of 15,224 and 65 datasets

291

from infected individuals and infected cell lines, respectively. The datasets from infected cells

292

were generated by Blanco-Melo et al. [29]. Duplicated reads were combined to reduce

293

amplification bias and mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome

294

(NC_045512v2) using hisat2 (v.2.1.0)[47]. For each dataset, the consensus sequences and the

295

frequency of nucleotides at each position were extracted from files generated by bcftools (v.1.10.2)

296

of the samtools package (v.1.1) with an in-house Perl script [48,49]. All further calculations were

297

performed in R. To reduce the number of variations due to sequencing errors and/or protocol

298

differences, only positions mapped with a sequencing depth of 50 reads and having at least 5 reads

299

with variations compared to the sample consensus were considered. Sequence logos were

300

generated with the ggseqlogo package (v.0.1) [50].

301
302

Differential expression analysis of transcript coding for APOBECs and ADARs.

303

High-throughput sequencing datasets generated in a recent transcription profiling study of

304

several cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from SRA [29]. Duplicated reads

305

were combined and mapped to the human reference genome (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.83) using

306

hisat2 (v.2.1.0)[47]. Transcript abundance was performed using HTSeq 0.12.4 [51] and normalized

307

into Transcripts Per Million (TPM) in R.

Cell culture and plasmids.

310

Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) were obtained from the American Type

311

Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-11268) and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium

312

(DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Fisher Scientific), 5% bovine calf serum

313

(Fisher Scientific) and 1x antibiotic-antimycotic (Fisher Scientific). HEK293T stably expressing

314

human ACE2 (kind gifts of Dr. Hyeryun Choe, The Scripps Research Institute) were cultured and

315

maintained in DMEM (Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 1 U/mL

316

penicillin, 1 µg/mL streptomycin, and 3 µg/mL glutamine (Corning). All cells were cultured at 37

317

°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The original bi-molecular fluorescence

318

complementation (BiFc) constructs GCN4 leucine zipper-Venus1 (ZipV1) and GCN4 leucine

319

zipper-Venus2 (ZipV2) were sourced from Stephen W. Michnick (reviewed in [52]). pCEP4(myc-

320

ACE2) was a gift from Erik Procko (Addgene plasmid #141185). pCAGGS expressing the SARS-

321

CoV-2 S protein (pCAGGS(S)) was provided by Dr. Florian Krammer (Mount Sinai).

media for 24h. Transient transfections were performed using JetPRIME (Polyplus transfection,

338

France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target cells were transfected with ZipV1

339

(0.5g) or pCEP4(myc-ACE2) (0.05g) and ZipV1 (0.5g). Effector cells population were

340

transfected with ZipV2 (0.5g) and pCAGGS(S) (0.125g) or pCAGGS(S20) (0.125g). Total

341

DNA was normalized using the empty pCAGGS vector DNA to 1g. Following transfection, cells

342

were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, cells were rinsed with PBS and detached with versene

343

(PBS, 0.53mM EDTA) and counted. 35,000 cells/well of both populations were co-seeded in

344

DMEM without serum in a 384-well black plate with optical clear bottom and incubated for 2

345

hours at 37 °C, 5% CO2. BiFC signal was acquired using Biotek Synergy Neo2 plate reader
