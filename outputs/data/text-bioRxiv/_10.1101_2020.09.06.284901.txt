Abstract
The pathogenesis of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus initiates through recognition of ACE2 receptor
(Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) of the host cells by the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
located at spikes of the virus. Following receptor-recognition, proteolytic cleavage between S1
and S2 subunits of the spike protein occurs with subsequent release of fusion peptide. Here, we
report our study on allosteric communication within RBD that propagates the signal from ACE2binding site towards allosteric site for the post-binding activation of proteolytic cleavage. Using
MD simulations, we have demonstrated allosteric crosstalk within RBD in apo- and receptorbound states where dynamic correlated motions and electrostatic energy perturbations contribute.
While allostery, based on correlated motions, dominates inherent distal communication in apoRBD, electrostatic energy perturbations determine favorable crosstalk within RBD upon binding
to ACE2. Notably, allosteric path is constituted with evolutionarily conserved residues pointing
towards their biological relevance. As revealed from recent structures, in the trimeric
arrangement of spike, RBD of one copy interacts with S2 domain of another copy. Interestingly,
the allosteric site identified is in direct contact (H-bonded) with a region in RBD that
corresponds to the interacting region of RBD of one copy with S2 of another copy in trimeric
constitution. Apparently, inter-monomer allosteric communication orchestrates concerted action
of the trimer. Based on our results, we propose the allosteric loop of RBD as a potential drug
target.

The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2), a close relative of the previously-known SARS-CoVs, has become an
ongoing global public-health threat.

Following its emergence, it has created an pandemic

situation within no time owing to its alarming high rate of transmission1.
Cell entry in particular, is an important early step of cross-species transmission. Spike
glycoprotein of CoVs plays the role of attachment to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2
(ACE2) receptor of the host cells and mediates viral entry. The association with the host-cell
receptor is regulated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein followed by
cleavage using a host protease, which releases the spike fusion peptide, and thereby promotes
viral entry2.
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus with four major constituent proteins: spike
protein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and nucleo-capsid protein (N)3. Lung
is the key target organ of the virus and, as the name implies, the infection induces pneumonia
accompanied by acute respiratory distress.
Recent high resolution structures of the trans-membrane spike protein of SARS CoV-2 show4
intertwined arrangement of three monomers. Each monomer consists of sub-domains S1 and S2.
The receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with ACE2 receptor of the host belongs to the
S1 subunit, while the S2 subunit anchors on the viral membrane. Interestingly, RBD of one copy
directly interacts with the S2 domain of another copy in the homotrimer (Figure 1). However,
the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the RBD that interacts with the receptor has not been fully
resolved in the recent spike trimer structures. A following crystallographic study5 has resolved
the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD with the ACE2 receptor.

Clearly, successful viral infection is reliant on the effective complex formation between the
host receptor and the protruded spikes on the viral surface, which makes it an obvious drug
target. However, in addition to the contact residues, studies have indicated potential role of noncontact residues and allostery in the spike protein-receptor interactions6.
To better understand the etiology of the infection, we have focused on the RBD of the spike
protein and its binding to the ACE2 receptor6a, 7, information on which may provide important
clues for designing drugs to combat the virus. Our study aims to understand the hidden allosteric
cross-talks in RBD upon recognition of the ACE2 receptor and their possible role in the activity
of the spike protein trimer. The allosteric crosstalk between the ACE2-binding residues of RBD
with its distal residues (away from the binding site) was evaluated using MD simulation followed
by extensive analyses of both dynamics and energy terms at atomic level. MD simulation has
long been implicated as a suitable procedure to explore the allosteric paths of information
exchange in between amino acid residues of a protein by elucidating intermediate protein
conformations that often occur in pico or nano second time scale which are often difficult to
capture with other techniques8. The conformational dynamics and change in energetic within
RBD before and after binding to the host receptor revealed the hidden communication that
shapes the crosstalk pathway leading to recognition and subsequent internalization of the virus.
Our study offers the identified allosteric sites as additional, potential drug targets. Insights
gained from our results on electrostatic contributions in viral infection suggest that modification
or inhibition of the allosteric communication would block proper functioning of the viral spike
protein and consequently hinder viral infection. Therefore, it may be considered as possible
intervention pathway for infection prevention.

Results and Discussion
Conformational dynamics of free and receptor-bound RBD. To probe deeper into the
dynamicity of free and ACE2-bound RBD of the COVID spike protein, Cα atoms based root
mean square fluctuations (RMSF) and Order parameter (S2) considering the N-H vectors9 of
RBD, were calculated from the corresponding trajectories. The overall bound state RMSF
revealed a lower value relative to the free RBD, implicating the higher rigidity of RBD after
binding to ACE2 compared to its apo-form. This observation suggests the ACE2-directed
stabilization of the RBD in the bound state by selection of particular conformation from the fast
time scale (ps-ns) regime.
In this regard, the residues exhibiting remarkably differentiated RMSF values between the
two states are clearly regions displaying some motifs having higher plasticity in free RBD (an
RMSF cut-off of >0.25 nm was set to define regions of high flexibility): the binding loop
(containing residues 474 to 486), and a distal loop (consisting residues 358 to 376). It is apparent
that the distal loop can be considered as an allosteric site (away from the ACE2 binding site of
RBD). Remarkably, this allosteric loop is in direct contact through H-bond to a region of the
RBD that coincides with the region of one monomer that interacts with the S2 domain of another
monomeric copy in the spike protein trimer4a, 10 (Figure 1).
Significantly, when the dynamicity of the apo-form was compared with respect to the ACE2bound RBD, the fluctuation of the allosteric loop decreased considerably along with the ACE2
binding loop (Figure 2A-C). This diminution in fluctuation was expected for the binding loop but
simultaneous decrement in dynamicity of the distal loop pointed towards allosteric involvement
through correlated motion11. Interestingly, a slightly enhanced flexibility was observed in

another distal loop (containing residues 384 to 390) of RBD (which actually involved in
interactions with S2 of another copy (Figure 1)) upon binding to ACE2 (Figure2).
Analysis of order parameters (S2) based on N-H vectors singularly complied with the
conclusions of the RMSF analysis where similar allosteric fluctuations (in both the above
mentioned distal loops) were also identified, with an overall decrement in the dynamicity of
ACE2-bound RBD with substantial alterations in the flexibility of the binding region (between
residues 474 to 486)(Figure S2). The S2 parameter represents flexibility and rigidity of a protein
with the values from 0 to 1, where values close to 0 and 1 indicate high flexibility and rigidity
respectively. Thus, this observation also suggests the decrement in overall RBD backbone
entropy factor (S2 is directly related to conformational entropy12) and hence formation of a stable
complex.

Modulation of allosteric communication within RBD upon receptor binding. Allosteric
involvement in proteins is one of the most important areas in the field of allosteric drug
development and it was proposed that allosteric communications were achieved either by
correlated motions of the amino acids or by fundamental non-bonded energy contributions11, 13.
A number of noticeable differences in correlation were found when DCCM (a residue-wise
correlation matrix-based approach where the correlated and anti-correlated motions are scored
between 1 and -1 considering strong: |Cij| = 1.0–0.7; moderate: |Cij| = 0.7–0.5; and weak: |Cij| =
0.3 -0.5) of both apo- and ACE2-bound RBD was compared. Free RBD consisted of several
strongly correlated and moderately anti-correlated motions within the amino acids, which were
either missing or became weakly correlated in the ACE2-bound RBD (Figure 3A-B).
Interestingly, the binding loop (residues from 474 to 486) and the allosteric loop (residues from

358 to 376) showed a moderate anti-correlated motion. In other words, these loops move away
from each other in a correlated manner. It may be noted here, both the allosteric loops are in
correlation which reestablishes the presence of H-bond between them (Figure 1B) as revealed by
crystal structure described above. This kind of anti-correlated motion, which could be attributed
to the structural flexibility of apo-RBD, is much weakened in the ACE2-bound RBD owing to its
conformational rigidity in bound state.
For further verification, Root Means Square Deviations (RMSD) distribution and Principal
Components Analysis (PCA) of both free and bound RBD were calculated. The RMSD
distribution comparative study between the two forms revealed strikingly divergent populations.
Two distinct populations were observed for the apo-RBD that were in agreement with PCA
results while the bound RBD noticeable displayed a single RMSD population (Figure 3C-D and
S3A-B).Both RMSD and PCA results clearly indicated the flexible conformational alterations of
apo-RBD between two conformational states which were not apparent for the ACE2 bound
RBD, simultaneously reestablishing its dynamic rigidity upon binding. Significantly, the
conformational fluctuation between two conformations of the apo-form what we observed can be
a reflection of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformational changes reported for RBD4b.

Dynamicity based allosteric communication in free RBD. Subsequently, we analyzed the path
of free RBD (ACE2-bound RBD was excluded from calculation as it showed negligible cross
correlated motions in DCCM) through which allosteric crosstalks propagate from binding loop
(selected residue P479) to the identified allosteric loop (selected residue D364). Note that, both
the residues were selected based on their highest betweenness-centrality values (Figure S3C)
within the highly fluctuating above-mentioned regions. Interestingly, the crosstalk was found to

propagate through the hydrogen bonded residues Y423 and D398 in one path (FigureS4A) and
P479-D364 via A419 to I410 in another path (Figure5Aand 3A), all other constituent residues
remain the same (see Methods for details). Notably, the constituent residues of the path are
evolutionarily conserved14. Based on the crystal structure5, this hydrogen-bonded communication
seems to act as a bridge between binding and allosteric regions of apo-RBD.

Hence, we

postulate that inherent allostery in apo-RBD is a pivotal factor in ACE2 recognition.

Hidden electrostatic perturbation revealed favorable allosteric crosstalk in ACE2-bound
RBD. The role of hidden contributions (e.g. electrostatic energy perturbation) in molecular
recognitions is another important contributor that remains yet to be investigated in case of the
spike protein-ACE2 complex. However, structural or dynamic information fail to describe the
same and hence, residue wise non-bonded energy contributions in terms of electrostatic
RBD−ACE2
RBD−ACE2
(∆𝐸𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜
) and van der Waals’ (∆𝐸𝑉𝐷𝑊
) interactions of the RBD towards the ACE2 binding

were calculated. Our results successfully captured the binding residue of RBD with significantly
high electrostatic energy, particularly, K417. Similarly, binding residues along with some
proximal to the binding site showed VDW contributions as expected, for example N487, Q493,
Y505, T500, N501 and Y489 (Figure4A-D)15. Residue wise electrostatic contributions (up to
~165 kcal/mol) are much higher compared to van der Waals' (up to ~12 kcal/mol). Hence,
undoubtedly in the recognition of ACE2 by RBD, the electrostatic energy is the predominant
factor in term of non-bonded energies towards the free energy of binding (Figure S4A). In
particular, some significant electrostatic contributions of RBD from distal residues like, D364,
K386 etc. were also evident (Figure 4B). We further calculated electrostatic interactions within
the RBD in both free and bound states to elucidate the communication path between ACE2

binding residue K417 and allosteric site residue D364 (see Methods for details). Allosteric
crosstalk in RBD propagated from K417to D364 via R408 to R355 to K356 (Figure 5B).Notably,
except binding residue K417,all other constituent partners show evolutionary conservation14.
Remarkably, the unfavorable pairwise electrostatic interactions of K355-356 pair in apo-form

ACE2-bound RBD ∆𝐸𝐸𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑜,408−417

indicated towards the hidden role of pair wise energy perturbation in the recognition of ACE2 by
spike protein RBD. Therefore, it can be a site-specific target for allosteric drugs.
Formation of the stable complex can also be verified from the noticeably high residue wise
electrostatic contributions compared to the van der Waals’ energy, as reported earlier15a. Note
that, we mentioned allosteric communication in RBD based on electrostatic energies too, and the
pairwise electrostatics become favorable in some pairs after binding to the receptor. On the
contrary to dynamic cross-correlation, the existence of favorable communication (between the
binding site to the allosteric regions of RBD of one copy towards the S2 domain of another copy)
based on pairwise electrostatics point towards hidden transmission of the signal for the cleavage
between S1 and S2domain of spike protein following association with ACE24a, 10.

Conclusions. We found that, following binding to ACE2, dynamicity of RBD decreases
resulting in stabilization of bound-RBD by the selection of a particular conformation from the
fast time scale (ps-ns) regime. While crosstalk mediated by cross-correlated motions between the
binding and allosteric loops dominates in free RBD, such dynamic allostery almost disappears

when RBD binds to ACE2. In contrast, pair-wise electrostatic energy perturbations dictate
favorable allosteric crosstalks within RBD in the ACE2-bound complex. The allosteric paths
derived from both dynamic cross correlations and electrostatic energies can be claimed relevant
for biological functions considering evolutionary conservation of the residues involved.
The architecture of an individual monomer of spike protein is extended in shape placing S2
domain away from the S1 (comprising RBD).

Interestingly, however, the criss-cross

arrangement of monomers in trimeric spike places the allosteric site of RBD of one monomer in
close proximity of the S2 domain of another copy. Thus, the allosteric communication likely
transmits from RBD of one monomer to S2 of another copy in the trimer (Movie S1). It is
conceivable that the trimer of spike protein needs to function in a concerted way. Such intermonomer communication allows regulation of concerted conformational changes within the
trimeric spike.
Taken together, our study suggests that the allostery in RBD plays a key role in the process
of host cell insertion upon recognition of ACE2 receptor. Based on our results, we propose that
allosteric region of the ACE2-binding site of RBD, reported here, can be a potential target for
allosteric drug designing.

In the context of recent SARS-Cov-2-related outbreak, when

designing drug against SARS-Cov-2 is a pressing need, residue-wise dynamics, as well as energy
information provided in this study would be beneficial for drug designing purpose.

and TIP3P water model18 with a box size of 1nm. The titrable residue protonation states were
defined using MCCE (multi-conformation continuum electrostatics) method19 and also based on
PROPKA20 web server (http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr_2.0.0) with respect to pH 7.2. The

followed by two-step equilibration, namely NVT equilibration followed by NPT equilibration.

was applied to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions. The cut-off for

short-range electrostatics and van der Waals’ interactions were 1.2 nm. MD simulations of 1 s

Dynamic Cross Correlation Mapping (DCCM). Cross-correlation maps were used to identify
the regions that move in or out of phase during the simulations11. The elements of the matrix (Cij)
were obtained from their position vector (r) as shown in Eq. 1:

Where i and j correspond to any two atoms, residues, or domains; ri and rj are position vectors of
i and j; and the angle brackets denote an ensemble average. Inter-atomic cross-correlation
fluctuations between any two pairs of atoms (or residues) can be calculated by using this
expression and can be represented graphically by the DCCM. The value of Cij can vary from -1
(strongly anti-correlated motion) to +1 (strongly correlated motion).

Path analysis from Correlated Motions. Hierarchical clustering was implemented for each

selecting the partitions with the highest modularity ranking, we selected the partition nearest to
the highest modularity score that consisted of the smallest number of overall communities. This
excluded the typical circumstance where several small communities with modularity values of
similarly high scores were created. The density of connections per node which was assessed by
the node centralities were calculated as described by the equation:

Figures

Figure 1: RBD of S1 and S2 domain of Spike protein. (A) Shows trimeric Spike protein
structure (PDB ID: 6Z43). The RBD of the S1 domain of one monomer (light blue) and the S2
domain of other monomer (magenta) is shown in close up view. The allosteric region of RBD
(part of S1 domain of one monomer, marked as 1st copy) and the S2 domain (neighboring copy
of monomer, marked as 2nd copy) connection is marked with black circle to show the postreceptor binding favorable allosteric signal transfer may occur in the trimeric Spike protein, as
predicted from the electrostatic perturbations in RBD. (B) Represents further close up view of
the two allosteric loops connected through H-bond. (C) Communication between RBD of the 1st
copy and S2 domain of the 2nd copy is shown with both H-bond and electrostatic interaction. Hbonds are shown in broken black lines.

Figure 2: Comparison of C atom dynamicity. (A) Residue wise C atom root mean square
fluctuations for both free and ACE2 bound RBD of SARS-Cov-2. Significant changes (above
cut-off value of 0.2 nm) were marked with different colored columns. RMSF values were
mapped onto the crystal structures (PDB ID: 6M0J) of respective (B) free, and (C) ACE2-bound
RBD. A spectrum bar based color scheme is shown (using PyMol) to point out differential
fluctuating regions of both, and are indicated by circles corresponding to the color scheme used
in (A).

Figure 3: Correlated motions and dynamicity. DCCM of (A) apo and (B) ACE2 bound RBD
are shown. Differential residue wise correlations in both the form of RBD are indicated by
boxes. Allosteric communication path was marked with broken circle. Correlation between two
allosteric loops is shown in small red box. RMSD probability distribution reflected two
populations in apo- (C), and single population in ACE2-bound RBD (D). The 3D projections of
both are shown in insets (calculated from PCA). Apo-RBD dynamicity reflected conformational
alterations between two states from ps-ns time scale regime of dynamicity.
