Abstract

28

The current outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by a novel

29

betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

30

CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. Coronavirus has a history of

31

causing epidemics in human and animals. In 2017 an outbreak in piglets by a

32

novel coronavirus was emerged designated as swine acute diarrhea

33

syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) which is originated from the same genus

34

of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV

35

(SARS-CoV) having a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it

36

can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Coronavirus host range is

37

determined by its spike glycoprotein (S). Given the importance of S protein in

38

viral entry to cells and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM

39

structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of

40

3.55 Å. Our study reveals that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit

41

quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit

42

pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with

43

that of the other four genera suggests the evolutionary process of the SADS-

44

CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features,

45

such as more compact architecture of S trimer, and masking of epitopes by

46

glycan shielding, which may facilitate viral immune evasion. These data

47

provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and

48

would extend our understanding of structural and functional diversity, which

Introduction

52

The risk of major coronavirus (CoV) epidemics in the previous two

53

decades comprising SARS in 2003, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

54

(MERS) in 2012, SADS in 2017, and the latest 2019 outbreak of human-

55

infecting virulent strain of SARS-CoV-2 have claimed a large number of

56

human lives and livestock. They have shared features of pathogenicity, origin

57

from bats [1-3]. The typical crown-like spike proteins on its surface gives it its

58

name

59

Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and grouped into four genera including

60

alpha- (α), beta- (β), both CoVs infecting mammals, gamma- (γ) CoVs

61

infecting birds, and delta- (δ) CoVs infecting mammals and birds [4]. The

62

genome of CoV is the second largest of all RNA viruses containing a positive-

63

sense, 27-32 kb in length single-strand RNA (+ssRNA) [5]. CoVs bring about

64

subclinical or respiratory syndrome, central nervous system (CNS) infections,

65

gastrointestinal ailments in humans, and animals [6, 7]. These infections are

66

accountable for 30% of the respiratory illnesses, atypical pneumonia [3, 8],

67

and show a tendency for interspecies transmission, which happened rather

68

often during CoV evolution and shaped the diversity of CoVs [9].

73

with death rate up to 90% in piglets of 5 days or younger in Guangdong

74

territory pig breeding farms and accounted for the killing of around 25 000

75

piglets [10]. SADS-CoV has a position with the class α-CoVs, and it is

76

enveloped +ssRNA virus [2, 6, 11]. The intracellular entry of SADS-CoV relies

77

on a precise interaction amid virion and the host cell. The disease is initiated

78

by the interplay of the viral particle with specific cell surface S trimmer [12].

79

CoVs from various genera display evident serotypes, for the most part,

80

because of the dissimilarity of their envelope-anchored diversified S proteins.

81

S protein is of around 1300 amino acids, has a place with class I viral

82

combination protein, including SARS-CoVs, human immunodeficiency virus

83

(HIV) envelop glycoprotein 160 (gp160), influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA),

84

paramyxovirus F and Ebola virus glycoprotein [13]. The S protein includes

85

three sections: a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor, and

86

a small intracellular tail. The ectodomain comprises of an N-terminal receptor-

87

binding domain (RBD) viral attachment and entry subunit S1 (approximately

88

700 amino acids) forming a crown-like structure and a membrane-fusion C-

89

terminal subunit S2 (approximately 600 amino acids) leading to an assembly

90

of architecture, i.e., CTD is sandwiched by its NTD [14]. In addition, CTDs

91

with the assistance of S1 retains a “lying down” inactive state, which transits

92

to “stand up” active state on the S trimer for efficient receptor binding [7, 15-

93

17].

The envelope trimeric S protein is vital for identifying host tropism and

utilize aminopeptidase N (APN) as its receptor, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and

102

SARS-CoV-2 employ angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and MERS-

103

CoV ties to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4). However, receptor investigation of

104

SADS-CoV demonstrated that none of the known CoV receptors, i.e., APN,

105

ACE2 and DPP4, is crucial for cell entry that shows the divergence and

106

significance of S protein in SADS-CoV infection [10]. Along these lines,

107

considering the clinical indications of this advancing virus, there is an

108

essential need for primary and practical comprehension of SADS-CoV to

109

expand mechanisms of viral entry and pathogenesis in pigs.

110

Notwithstanding the significance of the S protein in viral entry and host

111

immunity, high-resolution structural details of this large macromolecular

machine have been hard to acquire. In this study, a cryo-EM structure of

117

components, we detail the evolutionary perspective of SADS-CoV S in

comparison with S proteins from different CoV genera. In our study, SADS-

119

CoV S forms a “lying down” conformation following the transition from inactive

120

to an active state, and ACE2 is not the receptor of SADS-CoV. The structural

121

alignment suggests that SADS-CoV S is located between α-CoV and β-CoV

Results and discussions

132

Overall structure of SADS-CoV spike protein

133

In order to investigate the role of SADS-CoV S in its invasion, we aimed

134

to solve the high-resolution structure of SADS-CoV S. Ectodomain of SADS-

135

CoV S was expressed, and purified from media of insect cells after 3 days of

136

infection by baculovirus. A fusion peptide of general control protein GCN4 at

137

the C-terminal end of S was used to promote the protein to form a trimer [20]

138

(Fig. 1A). The size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) result showed that the

139

protein sample is a trimer in the solution and the purity of more than 95%

140

examined in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S1A, S1B). The protein displayed high

141

homogeneity in cryo-EM screening and was then diluted to 0.63 mg ml-1 for

142

the data collection. Cryo-EM micrograph movies were collected on a Gatan

143

K2 direct electron detector mounted on an FEI Titan Krios electron

144

microscope (Fig. S2). Following reference-free 2D classification of the S

145

protein, we determined a three-dimensional (3D) structure of the SADS-CoV

146

S trimer at 3.55 Å resolution judged by the gold-standard Fourier shell

147

correlation (FSC) criterion of 0.143 (Fig. 1B, 1C and Table 1). The resolved

148

atomic structure of prefusion SADS-CoV S ectodomain covers almost all of

149

the key structural elements, as shown in Fig. 1A except residues 81-101 of

150

NTD and residues 999-1068 of HR-C (Fig. 1D, Fig. S3). Forty-five (15 on

151

each subunit) N-linked glycans spread over the surface of the whole S trimer

152

with another 15 predicted but not observed. In addition, the protein trimer is

153

stabilized by 30 pairs (10 on each subunit) of disulfide bonds (Fig. S4). The S

154

trimer shows a dome-like shape, with three S1 heads forming a crown-like

155

structure and sitting on top of a trimeric S2 stalk (Fig. 1D, 1E, and Movie S1).

156

The trimer spike has a length of 143.2 Å from S1 to S2 and a width of 111.3 Å

157

and 61.4 Å at S1 and S2, respectively (Fig. 1E). Three S1-CTDs are located

158

at the top center of the S trimer arranged as a small triangle, whereas three

159

S1-NTDs are located on the lower and outer side of S1-CTDs arranged as a

160

big triangle. This architecture, i.e., CTD sandwiched by its own NTD and the

161

adjacent NTD, comes into being one side of the big triangle (Fig. 1F). The

162

cleavage site of S1 and S2 subunits locates between residues 544 (Val) and

163

545 (Arg). The central helicase N (CH-N) and C (CH-C) of S2 from each

164

subunit form a six-helix bundle in the core of S trimer. Heptad repeats N (HR-

165

N) contains four helices connected by three loops locked between the S1 and

166

S2 subunit at the outside of the S2 stalk, while part of the HR-C is missed in

167

the structure (Fig. 1G). Each monomeric subunit of S1 contains two major

168

domains, S1-NTD and S1-CTD which are used to bind attachment sialic acid

169

receptors or protein receptors and play a vital role in the CoV entry, and two

170

subdomains, SD1 and SD2 whose function are not very clear (Fig. 1H-1I,

171

Movie S1).

199

The S protein from all the four different genera of the CoVs packs a

200

crown-like structure by three monomeric subunits, which can be divided into

201

two packing modes: the cross-subunit packing mode and the intra-subunit

202

packing mode [21]. Our SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit

203

quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunits

204

pack together by head to head. In SADS-CoV S, the three NTDs from different

205

subunits are located at the vertices of the big triangle formed by the S1

206

subunits and sandwich the CTDs to the center of the triangle. As a result, the

207

putative receptor-binding moieties located on the top of CTDs are also

208

wrapped at the center of the crown-like trimer (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, the

209

geometry of SADS-CoV S resembles the prefusion structures of other α- and

210

δ-genera with the intra-subunit packing mode and is more compact than those

211

of β- and γ-genera that use the cross-subunit packing mode (Fig. 2A-2E).

212

Interestingly, although SADS-CoV belongs to the α-genera, its spike protein

213

doesn’t have the domain 0, which is commonly found in other α-genera CoVs,

214

e.g., NL63-CoV and PEDV (Fig. 2F-G) [20].

215

Different from the receptor-binding inactive state of these structures

216

whose all three CTDs in “lying down” positions (Fig. 2A-2E), the previous

217

study captured several β-CoVs S which contain one or two, even all three

218

CTDs in “stand up” positions [7, 15, 17, 22, 23]. The engagement of the CTDs

219

of SARS S trimer helps it to keep one or more CTDs in the “stand up” position

220

and facilitate the binding of ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies. If all the three

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976258; this version posted March 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

221

CTDs are in the “lying down” position, it is not possible to bind ACE2 due to

222

the partial binding sites are hidden and steric clashes between binding

223

factors. This kind of conformation represents an inactive state (Fig. 2H). The

224

CTDs in our structure keep a “lying down” state, and the receptor-binding

225

moieties are partially concealed. It needs to “stand up” on the spike trimer and

226

release the steric clash for efficient receptor binding. The linker between

227

CTDs and S1 subdomains workes as a hinge to facilitate the conformation

228

change of CTDs from “lying down” to “stand up”, furthermore, transit the

229

receptor-binding inactive state to active state (Fig. 2F).

230

It is noteworthy that stronger interactions in the SADS-CoV S trimer may

231

become obstacle conformational change and dissociation of S1-CTD in the

232

prefusion process (Fig. S5). Moreover, to probe the intrinsic mobility of the

233

CTD/RBD of S trimer in the apo form (or to see whether the CTD/RBD of S

234

trimer can spontaneously expand to an open state), we performed 2000 ns-

235

long coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [24]. A Martini

236

CG model was initially generated using the “lying down” state structure (Fig.

237

S6). The center-of-mass distances between every two CTDs/RBDs across the

238

simulations (Fig. S6) indicated that all the three CTDs/RBDs were stabilized

239

in a “lying down” state similar to the structure observed in this study, i.e. the

240

distance differences calculated from simulations and crystal structure were

241

less than 5 Å. Although we did not find apparent expending of the CTDs/RBDs

242

from a “lying down” state to a “stand up” state during the simulations, it did not

243

rule out the co-existence of the two states in the apo form. Because such a

244

large conformational transition may happen over long time scales (ms to s),

245

far beyond the simulations performed here. Taken together, these simulation

246

results may explain the homogeneity of SADS-CoV S observed in our 3D

247

classification and that the different S1-CTD conformations are invisible in our

248

results (Fig. 1B).

249

For the NTDs, the core structure consists of two six-stranded antiparallel

250

β-sheet layers stacked together, which takes the same galectin fold as human

251

galectins and the NTDs from the other genera. Besides the core structure,

252

NTD of SADS-CoV S1 also has a loop (residues 133-150) formed as a partial

253

ceiling-like structure that resembles the partial ceiling of γ-CoV rather than the

254

other α- and δ-coronavirus which do not have a ceiling-like structure, or the β-

255

CoV which has a reinforced ceiling-like structure (Fig. 2I-M). Based on the

256

structural similarity between the NTDs from four different CoVs genera, the

257

sugar-binding site in SADS-CoV S1-NTD might also be located in the pocket

258

formed between the core structure and the partial ceiling (Fig. 2I). Compared

259

with other CoVs, the structure of the subdomain under the core domain of

260

SADS-CoV S1-NTD has the same situation as the partial ceiling-like structure

261

(Fig. 2I-M). The previous study gave the idea that NTDs from the four genera

262

form an evolutionary spectrum in the order of α-, δ-, γ- and β-genera, with α-

263

CoVs NTD probably being the most ancestral [21]. Our structure has also

264

unexpectedly consistent with this conclusion. Furthermore, we propose that

the structural evolution of SADS-CoV S1-NTD is more likely to located

267

For the CTDs, despite there are dramatic sequential differences between

268

SADS-CoV S1-CTD and other CTDs, all of them share similar structural

269

topology (Fig. 2N-R). Unlike the other CTDs of α-CoVs and δ-CoVs which

270

have a more compact core β-sandwich structure containing two β-sheet

271

layers, our CTD resembles the γ- and β-CoVs which just has one layer β-

272

sheet and several α-helix and coil structures with a loose packing (Fig. 2N-R).

273

Based on the structural comparison of the CTDs of all the four genera, all the

274

other α-CoVS and δ-CoVs use the loops located on the top of the β-sandwich

275

of CTDs as its receptor binding motif (RBM). As a result, we propose that

276

SADS-CoV also uses these loops on the CTD as its RBM (Fig. 2N-P).

277

Moreover, the CTDs of γ-CoVs evolve to get extended loops, and the β-CoVs

278

obtain an insertion domain which contains RBM under the host immune

279

pressure, these receptor-binding moieties also located on the top of core

280

domain (Fig. 2Q-R). Previous studies have shown that the core structures are

281

two layers β-sandwiches for α- and δ-CoVs CTDs, weakened β-sandwiches

282

for γ-CoVs CTDs, and single β-sheet layer for β-CoVs CTDs. The RBMs are

283

three short discontinuous loops for α- and δ-CoVs CTDs, two reinforced loops

284

for γ-CoVs CTDs, and a single continuous insertion domain for β-CoVs CTDs.

285

The CTDs from different genera give an evolutionary spectrum, using α- and

286

δ-CoVs CTDs as ancestral, γ-CoVs CTDs as the transitional structure and β-

328

phylogenetic analysis of the S genes showed that the S gene cluster can be

329

divided into two groups: α-CoV-1 and α-CoV-2. All of the SADS-CoVs and bat

330

coronavirus HKU2 belong to α-CoV1 which group with the β-CoVs to form the

331

half evolutionary branch of CoVs, whereas the other α-CoVs cluster to the α-

332

CoV-2 [11, 25]. The structural alignment of the SADS-CoV S trimer by Dali

333

analysis (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/) implies that SADS-CoV S

334

has a relative conservation with that of β-CoVs, as reflected by the generally

335

high Z-scores and high RMSD (Table S1). In addition, the Dali analysis of

336

CTD showed that SADS-CoV S CTD is relatively poorly conserved with β-

337

CoVs, as reflected by the generally low Z-scores and high RMSD. However, it

338

shares roughly identical core folding with other β-CoVs, i.e., HKU9, SARS-

339

CoV, MERS-CoV, HKU1 and OC43 (Table S2). Taken together, these results

340

are consistent with that of the sequence alignment.

341

Based on the phylogenetic analysis, we compared the CTDs of SADS-

342

CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by the sequence and structure. The whole

343

SADS-CoV S ectodomain is only approximately 30% sequence identity when

344

compared with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which obstructs structural

345

alignment between SADS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Especially

346

there is no significant homologous CoV S CTD found in the PDB when the

347

SADS-CoV S CTD sequence as the inquiry. Interestingly, the SADS-CoV S

348

CTD is smaller (about 130 residues) than other CoV CTD (about 170

349

residues) (Fig. 3A). To further investigate the differences between the S of

350

SADS and other CoVs, and deduce the hypothesis of SADS pathogenic

351

mechanisms, we focused on CTD and performed structural alignments using

352

the complexes of CTD (SARS-CoV-2)-ACE2, CTD (SARS-CoV)-ACE2, CTD

353

(NL63-CoV)-ACE2 (Fig. 3B-3D) and the CTDs of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV

354

and SADS-CoV (Fig. 3E). Surprisingly, although SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV

355

and SADS-CoV CTD do not share significant sequence homology and belong

356

to a different family of CoVs (Fig. 3A), they share roughly identical

357

organization and core folding (Fig. 3E). Notably, SADS-CoV uses the variant

358

loop region as its RBM, which is consistent with the insertion domain of

359

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 CTDs that is formed by two β sheets and

360

several loops (Fig. 3E). Meanwhile, compared with the β-CoVs SARS-CoV-2

361

and SARS-CoV, the α-CoV NL63 also use its loops to bind ACE2. Although

362

the loops of SADS-CoV and NL63 CTDs share a structural similarity, SADS-

363

CoV cannot use the ACE2 as its receptor. These features imply that both of

364

the variant sequence and the local structure of these loops are combined to

365

determine the receptor binding specificity.

Immune evasion strategies by SADS-CoV S

379

As a protein located on the surface of the virus, the S proteins mediate

380

viral entry into host cells and also undergo the immune pressure from the

381

immune system of the host at the same time. The structure of SADS-CoV S

382

provides some hints on the immune evasion strategies of SADS-CoV.

383

On the one hand, the SADS-CoV S has a classical compact structure as

384

other α-CoVs, which uses the intra-subunit packing mode (Fig. 2A-2B). As a

385

result, this kind of architecture can maximally reduce the surface area of the S

386

protein to the immune system. Moreover, all of the NTDs and CTDs in a “lay

387

down” station (closed conformation) can further reduce immune pressure

388

(Fig. 2F). Nevertheless, the NTDs and CTDs still have the chance to expose

389

for receptor binding. Furthermore, they can also be selected as single- or two-

390

RBD system [4]. Based on the structural alignment of these structures, we

391

speculate that SADS-CoV uses the two-RBD system for which the NTD is

392

used as the attachment receptor-binding domain and the CTD is used as the

393

protein receptor-binding domain. Upon infecting host cells, S1-CTD would

394

need to switch to an open conformation (“stand up”) to render the putative

395

RBM loops accessible to the host receptor. This closed-to-open mechanism

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976258; this version posted March 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

396

can minimize the exposure of the putative RBM loops to the immune system

397

[4].

398

On the other hand, as one of the immune evasion strategies, masking of

399

epitopes by glycan shielding is usual in CoV evolution [26]. Our map shows

400

that fifty N-linked glycans are spreading over the surface of each S subunit.

401

They are mainly located on the surface of S1 rather than on S2 like HCoV-

402

NL63 (Fig. 4A). In contrast to that, HCoV-NL63 S evades host immune

403

surveillance mainly by glycan shielding its S2 epitopes, SADS-CoV spike

404

appears to evade host immune surveillance mainly by glycan shielding its S1

405

epitopes [26]. In addition, unlike the other α-CoV and δ-CoV whose putative

406

sugar-binding sites are surrounded by glycans, most of the SADS-CoV N-

407

linked glycosylation sites are located on the CTD (Fig. 4A-4B). As a result,

408

the putative sugar-binding sites on the NTD are shielded, not by glycans, but

409

by the partial ceiling-like structure on the top of the core structure. As a

410

comparison, this feature is consistent with BCoVS1-NTD [27]. Unlike the

411

HCoV-NL63 receptor-binding residues interacting with domain A belonging to

412

the same protomer, SADS-CoV CTD uses a loop (residues 321-328) to

413

interacting with NTD from the same S1. Both use N-linked glycosylation

414

(residue Asp358) to make them buried and not available to engage the host

415

cell receptor (Fig. 4C) [26]. Taken together, SADS-CoV has several unique

416

structural features that may facilitate viral immune evasion.
