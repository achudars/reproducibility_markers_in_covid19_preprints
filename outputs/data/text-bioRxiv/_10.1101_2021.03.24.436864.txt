Abstract: The emergence of antigenically distinct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with increased transmissibility is a public health threat. Some of these
variants show substantial resistance to neutralization by SARS-CoV-2 infection- or vaccinationinduced antibodies, which principally target the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the virus spike
5

glycoprotein. Here, we describe 2C08, a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced germinal center B
cell-derived human monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor binding motif within the RBD.
2C08 broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants with remarkable potency and reduces lung
inflammation, viral load, and morbidity in hamsters challenged with either an ancestral SARSCoV-2 strain or a recent variant of concern. Clonal analysis identified 2C08-like public clonotypes

10

among B cell clones responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination in at least 20 out of 78
individuals. Thus, 2C08-like antibodies can be readily induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and
mitigate resistance by circulating variants of concern.
One Sentence Summary: Protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants by a potently neutralizing
vaccine-induced human monoclonal antibody.

Main Text:
SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic coronavirus that first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of
China in late 2019 (1, 2). The virus quickly spread to multiple continents, leading to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than
5

120 million confirmed infections, leading to approximately three million deaths (3). The damaging
impact of the morbidity and mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a global
effort towards developing SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures. These campaigns led to the rapid
development and deployment of antibody-based therapeutics (immune plasma therapy,
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)) and vaccines (lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA, virus-

10

inactivated, and viral-vectored platforms) (4–8). The high efficacy of mRNA-based vaccines in
particular has raised hope for ending the pandemic (9–11). However, the emergence of multiple
SARS-CoV-2 variants that are antigenically distinct from the early circulating strains used to
develop the first generation of vaccines has raised concerns for compromised vaccine-induced
protective immunity (12–14). Indeed, multiple studies have demonstrated that these variants show

15

reduced neutralization in vitro by antibodies elicited in humans in response to SARS-CoV-2
infection or vaccination (15–18). This observation highlights the need for better understanding of
the breadth of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced antibody responses and possible adjustments of
prophylactic and therapeutic reagents to combat emerging variants.
SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated primarily by the binding of the viral spike (S)

20

protein through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the cellular receptor, human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (19). Thus, the S protein is a critical target for antibody-based
therapeutics to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and limit its spread. Indeed, the RBD is
recognized by many potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (20–27). Pfizer-BioNTech
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) encodes the full-length prefusion stabilized SARS3

CoV-2 S protein and induces robust serum binding and neutralizing antibody responses in humans
(9, 28). We recently described the S-specific plasmablast and germinal center (GC) B cell
responses induced by BNT162b2 vaccination in healthy adults. GC B cells were analyzed in
aspirates from the draining axillary lymph nodes of 12 participants after vaccination. We verified
5

the specificity of the GC response by generating a panel of recombinant human mAbs from single
cell-sorted S+ GC B cells isolated from three participants (29). The majority of these vaccineinduced antibodies are directed against the RBD. Here, we assess the capacity of these anti-RBD
mAbs to recognize and neutralize recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants.
From a pool of S+ GC B cell-derived mAbs, we selected 13 human anti-RBD mAbs that bound

10

avidly to the predominantly circulating WA1/2020 D614G SARS-CoV-2 strain referred to
hereafter as the D614G strain (29, 30). We assessed mAbs binding to recombinant RBDs derived
from the D614G strain and three SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Only one mAb, 1H09, showed decreased binding
to the RBD derived from the B.1.1.7 variant (Fig. 1A). Four additional mAbs completely lost or

15

showed substantially reduced binding to the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 variant RBDs (Fig. 1A). The
remaining eight mAbs showed equivalent binding to RBDs from all tested strains (Fig. 1A). We
next examined the in vitro neutralization capacity of the 13 mAbs against the D614G SARS-CoV2 strain using a high-throughput focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) with authentic virus
(31). Only five mAbs (2C08, 1H09, 1B12, 2B06, and 3A11) showed high neutralization potency

20

against D614G with 80% neutralization values of less than 100 ng/mL. We then assessed the ability
of these five mAbs to neutralize the B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 variants. Consistent with the
RBD binding data, 1H09 failed to neutralize any of the emerging variants, whereas 1B12, 2B06
and 3A11 neutralized B.1.1.7 but not the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 variants (Fig. 1B). One antibody,
2C08, neutralized the four SARS-CoV-2 strains we tested with remarkable potency (half-maximal

inhibitory concentration of 5 ng/mL) (Fig. 1B), indicating that it recognizes RBD residues that are
not altered in these variants.
To assess the protective capacity of 2C08 in vivo, we utilized a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2
infection (32). We evaluated the prophylactic efficacy of 2C08 against the D614G strain and
5

against a fully infectious recombinant SARS-CoV-2 with B.1.351 spike gene (Wash SA-B.1.351;
D80A, 242-244 deletion, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G and A701V) (16) in 4–6-weekold male Syrian hamsters. Animals treated with 2C08 and challenged with either virus did not lose
weight during the experiment and started to gain weight (relative to starting weight) on 3 dpi. In
contrast, animals treated with the isotype control mAb started losing weight on 2 dpi (Fig 2A).

10

The average weights between the isotype- and 2C08-treated animals differed by 5.9 percent on 3
dpi (P = 0.008) and 7.7 percent 4 dpi (P = 0.008) for the D614G challenge and by 6.8 percent on
3 dpi (P = 0.095) and 9.1 percent 4 dpi (P = 0.056) for the B.1.351 challenge. Consistent with the
weight loss data, 2C08 treatment reduced viral RNA levels by more than 10,000-fold in the lungs
of the D614G challenged hamsters and by approximately 1000-fold in those challenged with

15

B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 (P = 0.008 for both) (Fig. 2B, Fig. S1A) on 4 dpi compared to the isotype
control mAb groups. Prophylactic treatment also significantly reduced infectious virus titers for
both strains detected in the lungs on 4 dpi (P = 0.008 for both) (Fig 2C). In addition to viral load,
concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly reduced in animals that received
2C08 prophylaxis (Fig. 2D). In comparison to control mAb treated animals, a significant decrease

20

in host gene-expression was observed for Ccl3, CcL5, Ifit3, Ifit6, Ip10, Irf7 and Rig-I in lungs of
2C08-treated animals. Overall, prophylaxis with 2C08 showed substantial capacity to decrease
viral infection in lower respiratory tissues upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 strains with spike
genes corresponding to ancestral and a key emerging variant.

To define the RBD residues targeted by 2C08, we used VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric viruses (S
from D614G strain) to select for variants that escape 2C08 neutralization as previously described
(31, 33). We performed plaque assays on Vero cells with 2C08 in the overlay, purified the
neutralization-resistant plaques, and sequenced the S genes (Fig. 3A, Fig. S2A). Sequence analysis
5

identified the S escape mutations G476D, G476S, G485D, F486P, F486V and N487D, all of which
are within the RBD and map to residues involved in ACE2 binding (Fig. 3B). To determine
whether any of the 2C08 escape mutants we isolated are represented among SARS-CoV-2 variants
circulating in humans, we screened all publicly available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (34,
35). Using 829,162 genomes from Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID),

10

we calculated each substitution frequency in the identified residues site. Of the six escape variants
we identified, four were detected among circulating isolates of SARS-CoV-2. The frequency of
these substitutions among clinical isolates detected so far is exceedingly rare, with the escape
variants representing less than 0.008% of sequenced viruses. In comparison, the D614G
substitution is present in 49% of sequenced isolates (Fig. S2B).

15

We noted that 2C08 targeted residues are similar to those recognized by a previously described
human mAb, S2E12, which was isolated from an infected patient (25). S2E12 shares a high
sequence identity with 2C08 (95% amino acid identity) and is encoded by the same
immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable region genes (Fig. 3C, Table S1). Similar to 2C08,
S2E12 exhibits potent neutralizing activity in vitro and protective capacity in vivo. The cryo-EM

20

structure of S2E12 in complex with S shows that the mAb recognizes an RBD epitope that partially
overlaps with the ACE2 receptor footprint known as the receptor binding motif (25) (Fig. S3).
S2E12 heavy chain amino acid residues that engage the RBD are identical to those in 2C08,
suggesting that 2C08 likely engages the RBD in a manner similar to that of the structurally
characterized S2E12. Furthermore, we identified two additional human mAbs, 253H55L and

COV2-2196, that share genetic and functional features with 2C08 and have nearly identical
antibody-RBD interactions as those of S2E12 (22, 36) (Fig. 3C, Fig. S3). Dong et al. noted that
COV2-2196 is likely part of a public B cell clone, citing S2E12 and mAbs generated by two other
groups which have similar characteristics (24, 25). This prompted us to conduct an expanded
5

search for 2C08-like clonotypes and mAbs. We identified 20 additional mAbs that share the same
genetic attributes of 2C08, S2E12, 253H55L and COV2-2196 isolated by different groups from
SARS-CoV-2 patients or vaccine recipients (Fig. 3C and Table S1). The primary contact residues
described for S2E12 were largely conserved for all mAbs (Fig. 3C).
Cloning and expression of recombinant human mAbs from single cell sorted B cells is now an

10

established method for generating potential therapeutics against a variety of human pathogens. The
source cells are predominantly plasmablasts or memory B cells that are isolated from blood after
infection or vaccination (37). Here, we describe 2C08, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced mAb
cloned from a GC B cell clone isolated from a draining axillary lymph node sampled from a healthy
adult after receiving their second dose of mRNA-based vaccine (29). 2C08 is a potently

15

neutralizing antibody that targets the receptor binding motif within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S
protein and blocks infection by circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern both
in vitro and in vivo.
2C08 is a “public” mAb, meaning that it is encoded by multiple B cell clonotypes isolated from
different individuals that share similar genetic features (36). Public antibody responses in humans

20

have been observed after many infections, including SARS-CoV-2 infection (24, 36, 38–43). In
the case of 2C08-like clonotypes, the mAbs not only share the immunoglobulin heavy and light
chain variable region genes, but also have near identical CDRs and are functionally similar. Several
have been shown to bind RBD and neutralize D614G as well as variants B.1.17 and B.1.351. 2C08like mAbs were isolated from multiple SARS-CoV-2 infected patients independently of

demographics or severity of infection. Robbiani et al. isolated 2C08-like mAbs from three of six
infected individuals analyzed (24). Tortorici et al. and Zost et al. detected a 2C08-like antibody in
one or both of two infected individuals they examined, respectively, whereas Kreer et al. detected
a 2C08-like clone in two of seven patients, in one of whom it was expanded (22, 25, 26). Wang et
5

al. isolated 2C08-like mAbs from five of 14 individuals who received a SARS-CoV-2 mRNAbased vaccine (15). Nielsen et al. identified 2C08-like rearrangements in sequences derived from
four of 13 SARS-CoV-2 patients (44). It remains to be determined what fraction of the antibody
responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in humans are comprised of 2C08-type antibodies
that are public, potently neutralizing, and so far, minimally impacted by the mutations found in the

10

variants of concern. It is important to note that at least one 2C08-like mAb, COV2-2196, is
currently being developed for clinical use (36).
Notably, most of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine induced anti-RBD mAbs also recognized RBDs from the
recent variants. It is of some concern, however, that four of the five neutralizing anti-RBD mAbs
lost their activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2 variants. This is consistent with

15

the data reported by Wang et al. showing that the neutralizing activity of 14 of 17 vaccine induced
anti-RBD mAbs was abolished by the introduction of the mutations associated with these variants
(15). More extensive analyses with a larger number of mAbs that target the RBD and non-RBD
sites will be needed to precisely determine the fraction of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody
response that is compromised due to antigenic changes in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of

20

concern. We note that somewhat higher levels of lung viral RNA were recovered from the 2C08treated animals challenged with the B.1.351-like variant compared to those challenged with the
D614G strain. This was unexpected given the similar in vitro potency of 2C08 against both viruses
and its capacity to protect animals from both groups against weight loss equivalently. One

possibility is that 2C08 more readily selected for a partial escape mutant against viruses displaying
the B.1.351 variant spike than the WA1/2020 D614G spike.
Given the germinal center B cell origin of 2C08, the binding of 2C08-related clones could be
further refined through somatic hypermutation, and their descendants could become part of the
5

high affinity memory B cell and long-lived plasma cell compartments that confer durable
protective immunity. Together, these data suggest that first-generation SARS-CoV-2 mRNAbased vaccines can induce public antibodies with robust neutralizing and potentially durable
protective activity against ancestral circulating and key emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Expi293F cells were cultured in Expi293 Expression Medium (Gibco). Vero-TMPRSS2 cells (a
gift from Siyuan Ding, Washington University School of Medicine) were cultured at 37°C in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1× non-essential amino acids, and 100 U/ml of
penicillin–streptomycin.

Viruses
The 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from the US Centers for
Disease Control. The UK B.1.1.7 isolate was obtained from an infected individual (16). The point
mutation D614G in the spike gene was introduced into an infectious complementary DNA clone
of the 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 strain as described previously (45). The generation of a
SARS-CoV-2 virus with the South African variant spike gene (B.1.351) in the background of
2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020 was described previously (16). All viruses were passaged once in
Vero-TMPRSS2 cells and subjected to deep sequencing after RNA extraction to confirm the
introduction and stability of substitutions (16). All virus preparation and experiments were
performed in an approved Biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility.

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) generation
Antibodies were cloned as described previously (46). Briefly, VH, Vκ, and Vλ genes were
amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and nested PCR reactions from singly sorted GC B cells
using primer combinations specific for IgG, IgM/A, Igκ, and Igλ from previously described primer
sets (47) and then sequenced. To generate recombinant mAbs, restriction sites were incorporated

via PCR with primers to the corresponding heavy and light chain V and J genes. The amplified
VH, Vκ, and Vλ genes were cloned into IgG1, Igκ, and Igλ expression vectors, respectively, as
described previously (47–49). Heavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into Expi293F
cells (Gibco) for expression, and mAbs were purified with protein A agarose (GoldBio).

Antigens
Recombinant receptor binding domain of S (RBD), was expressed as previously described (50,
51). Briefly, RBD, along with the signal peptide (amino acids 1-14) plus a hexahistidine tag were
cloned into mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. RBD mutants were generated in the
pCAGGS RBD construct by changing single residues using mutagenesis primers. Recombinant
proteins were produced in Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) by transfection with purified DNA
using the ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (ThermoFisher). Supernatants from transfected
cells were harvested 4 days post-transfection, and recombinant proteins were purified using NiNTA agarose (ThermoFisher), then buffer exchanged into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and
concentrated using Amicon Ultracel centrifugal filters (EMD Millipore).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay
Assays were performed in 96-well plates (MaxiSorp; Thermo). Each well was coated with 100 µL
of wild-type or variant RBD or bovine serum albumin (1µg/mL) in PBS, and plates were incubated
at 4 °C overnight. Plates were then blocked with 0.05% Tween20 and 10% FBS in PBS. mAbs
were serially diluted in blocking buffer and added to the plates. Plates were incubated for 90 min
at room temperature and then washed 3 times with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS. Goat anti-human
IgG-HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch 109-035-088, 1:2,500) was diluted in blocking buffer before

adding to wells and incubating for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times with
0.05% Tween20 in PBS, and then washed 3 times with PBS. o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride
substrate dissolved in phosphate-citrate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with H2O2 catalyst was incubated
in the wells until reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 M HCl. Optical density measurements
were taken at 490 nm. Area under the curve was calculated using Graphpad Prism v8.

Focus reduction neutralization test
Serial dilutions of each mAb diluted in DMEM with 2% FBS were incubated with 102 focusforming units (FFU) of different strains or variants of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. Antibodyvirus complexes were added to Vero-TMPRSS2 cell monolayers in 96-well plates and incubated
at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were overlaid with 1% (w/v) methylcellulose in MEM
supplemented with 2% FBS. Plates were harvested 24 h later by removing overlays and fixed with
4% PFA in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Plates were washed and sequentially incubated
with an oligoclonal pool of SARS2-2, SARS2-11, SARS2-16, SARS2-31, SARS2-38, SARS2-57,
and SARS2-71 anti-S antibodies (33) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma 12-349)
in PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. SARS-CoV-2-infected
cell foci were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and quantitated on an
ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies).

SARS-CoV-2 hamster studies
All procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Washington University in Saint Louis. Four- to
six-week old male Syrian hamsters were obtained from Charles River Laboratories and housed in

an enhanced ABSL3 facility at Washington University in St Louis. Animals were randomized from
different litters into experimental groups and were acclimatized at the BSL3 facilities for 4-6 days
prior to experiments. Animals received intra-peritoneal (IP) injection of isotype control or antiSARS-CoV-2 mAbs 24 h prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Hamsters were anesthetized with
ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) via IP injection and were intranasally inoculated
5 x 105 PFU of 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020-D614G or Wash SA-B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 in 100
µL PBS. Animal weights were measured every day for the duration of experiments. Animals were
euthanized 4 dpi and the lungs were collected for virological analyses. Left lung lobes were
homogenized in 1 mL of PBS or DMEM, clarified by centrifugation, and used for virus titer and
cytokine assays.

Virus titration assays from hamster lung homogenates
Plaque assays were performed on Vero-Creanga cells in 24-well plates. Lung tissue homogenates
were serially diluted 10-fold, starting at 1:10, in cell infection medium (DMEM + 2% FBS + Lglutamine + penicillin + streptomycin). Two hundred and fifty microliters of the diluted virus were
added to a single well per dilution per sample. After 1 h at 37°C, the inoculum was aspirated, the
cells were washed with PBS, and a 1% methylcellulose overlay in MEM supplemented with 2%
FBS was added. Seventy-two hours after virus inoculation, the cells were fixed with 4% formalin,
and the monolayer was stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v in 25% methanol in water) for 1 h at
20°C. The number of plaques were counted and used to calculate the plaque forming units/mL
(PFU/mL).
To quantify viral load in lung tissue homogenates, RNA was extracted from 140 μL samples using
QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) and eluted with 50 μL of water. Four μL RNA was used for

containing the target region of the N gene.

Cytokine assay from hamster lung homogenates
RNA extracted from hamster lung homogenates was reverse transcribed using random hexamers
and Superscript III (Thermo Scientific) with the addition of RNase inhibitor according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Gene expression of inflammatory cytokines was determined using

Wash SA-B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters and naïve controls using the -ΔΔCt method.

Selection of 2C08 mAb escape mutants in SARS-CoV-2 S
We used VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S chimera with S D614G to select for SARS-CoV-2 S variants that
escape mAb neutralization described as previously (31, 33). Antibody neutralization resistant
mutants were recovered by plaque isolation. Briefly, plaque assays were performed to isolate the
VSV-SARS-CoV-2 escape mutant on Vero cells with mAb 2C08 in the overlay. The
concentration of 2C08 in the overlay was determined by neutralization assays at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 100. Escape clones were plaque-purified on Vero cells in the presence of
2C08, and plaques in agarose plugs were amplified on MA104 cells with the 2C08 present in the
medium. Viral supernatants were harvested upon extensive cytopathic effect and clarified of cell
debris by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min. Aliquots were maintained at -80°C. Viral RNA
was extracted from VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutant viruses using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and S
was amplified using OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen). The mutations were identified by Sanger
sequencing (GENEWIZ).

mAb were tested for neutralizing activity against VSV-SARS-CoV-2. The concentration of 2C08
added in the overlay completely inhibited viral infection. Data are representative of two
independent experiments. (B) 2C08 escape profile in currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses
isolated from humans. For each site of escape, we counted the sequences in GISAID with an amino
acid change (829,521 total sequences at the time of the analysis). Variant circulating frequency is
represented as a rainbow color map from red (less circulating with low frequency) to violet (most
circulating with high frequency). A black cell indicates the variant has not yet been isolated from
a patient. A rainbow cell with cross indicates the variant has been isolated from a patient, but not
appear in those 2C08 mAb escape mutants.
