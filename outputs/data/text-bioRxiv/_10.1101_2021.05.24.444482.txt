Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants has ravaged most
countries around the world including Bangladesh. We have analyzed publicly available genomic
data to understand the current COVID-19 outbreak scenario as well as the evolutionary origin
and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh. All the early isolates as well as
recent B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had already spread across the major divisional cities of
Bangladesh. A sex biasness towards male COVID-19 patient samples sequencing has observed
over female in all age-group, that could be the trend in infection rate. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated a total of 13 estimated countries, including Italy, India, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, United States, Russia, and Denmark, could be the possible origin introduced SARSCoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh because of regional and intercontinental travel. Recent, B.1.1.7
variant could be imported from a total of 7 estimated countries including UK, India, Nigeria,
Spain, Ireland, Australia, and Indonesia, while South Africa and the United States are the most
likely sources of B.1351 variant in Bangladesh. Based on these findings, public health strategies
could be designed and implemented to reduce the local transmission of the virus.

1. Introduction
The world has been going through a global pandemic of acute respiratory disease named the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of betacoronavirus within the
Coronaviridae family1, that was first reported from Wuhan, China, in December 20192. SARSCoV-2 possesses an enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense ~30kb long ribonucleic acid
(RNA) genome3. The longest segment of the genome at 5’ end encodes for orf1ab polyprotein
while the rest of the genome consists of genes encoding four structural proteins including the
spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein
(N)4,5. Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, it has rapidly spread to 220 countries and
territories including Bangladesh to date (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus), posing an
unprecedented public health threat with over 165 million recorded cases of COVID-19, and more
than 3.4 million deaths attributable to the disease worldwide as of May 20, 20216. Bangladesh
documented its first case of COVID-19 on March 8, 20207. Since then, there have been 786,698
confirmed cases of the disease in the country, as well as 12,310 deaths with 1.56% case fatality
rate (CFR)6.
Over the devastating course of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, several variants have appeared in
different regions of the world. Of them, a more infectious variant with D614G mutation in the
spike glycoprotein quickly became dominant after emergence, owing to the increased human-tohuman transmission efficiency, amongst the globally circulating strains during the early stages of
the pandemic8–11. According to a recent study, 98% of Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates are of
this common variant12. In addition to the pre-existing variants, several new variants of concern
(VOCs) including B.1.1.7 or 501Y.V1, B.1.351 or 501Y.V2 and P.1 or 501Y.V3, have emerged
independently from the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, and Brazil respectively13–15. Out of
these three VOCs, presence of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had been reported in Bangladesh
(https://virological.org/t/detection-of-the-b-1-1-7-and-b-1-351-sars-cov-2-variants-in-bangladesh
/668), as well as in dozens of other countries around the globe as of April 9, 2021 (https://covlineages.org/global_report.html). Although much is still unknown about these VOCs,
preliminary epidemiological and phylogenetic studies suggest the B.1.1.7 variant is 43 to 90%
(95% CI 38–130) more transmissible than pre-existing variants13, with a 50 to 100% higher
reproduction number16, and increased mortality17. Furthermore, findings from other preliminary

studies indicate the B1.351 variant is associated with higher viral load with potential advantage
of enhanced transmissibility or immune escape14,18–20. This variant may also amplify the risk of
infection in people who have already been immunized21.
As COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc due to rapid transformation of SARS-CoV-2,
Bangladesh has begun a nationwide inoculation drive in order to restrain the virus, and
administered more than 9.6 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to date
(https://github.com/owid/covid-19data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/country_data/Bangladesh.csv). However, the daily
COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country have seen a steep rise recently6, which is found to be
correlated with the increasing detection of B.1.351 variant circulating in the country22. Another
genomic variant surveillance in Bangladesh, conducted from January 1 - March 24, 2021,
observed a maximum 52% frequency of B.1.1.7 variant up until the second week of March 2021,
and a dramatic rise in B.1.351 variant frequency of up to 81% in subsequent weeks
(https://www.icddrb.org/news-and-events/news?id=874). In order to identify such emerging
variants in the country, and monitor the viral evolution on a genomic level, scientists from
Bangladesh have sequenced over 1,500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and deposited the sequences in
the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database23. Analyses of these
genomic data may aid in understanding the genetical and evolutionary features of the virus24, as
well as in evaluating the outcome of various disease control strategies in Bangladesh, ranging
from quarantine measures to travel restrictions, both locally and internationally, to reduce the
transmission rate of evolving lineages.

necessitates a comprehensive genomic investigation of adequate and diverse samples to
determine the country-specific transmission origin of Bangladeshi isolates including variants. As
a result, this may help establish a firm understanding of viral epidemiology in the country, which
is crucial for vaccine efficacy, clinical severity of infection, disease mortality, diagnostics and
therapeutics, and public health safety precautions.
In this study, we aimed to identify the possible origin and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2
isolates into Bangladesh, during the initial days of the pandemic, as well as for both B.1.1.7 and
B.1.351 variants in recent times. We analyzed publicly available genomic data from countries of
concern across all regions and estimated 3 separate time-resolved phylogenies with a total of
4,157 subsampled genome sequences. By utilizing the genomic epidemiology approach to the
data, we demonstrate that both the initial viral outbreak and the recent upsurge of VOCs in
Bangladesh was the result of several independent introductions of the virus linked to
international travel.

2. Materials and methods
2.1 Data Acquisition & Filtering
A total of 97,040 unique SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and metadata were downloaded from
the GISAID database23 and subsequently divided into 4 subsets (Table 1) for downstream
analyses. The G1 subset contained a total of 1,009 complete, human-host genomes from
Bangladesh as of April 9, 2021 (Dataset S1). From the subset G1, a set of 612 high-coverage
genomes till February 12, 2021 were considered for initial phylogeny and added to the G2 subset
(Dataset S2). In addition, 86,314 complete genomes with a sample collection date prior to 1st
May 2020 were included to the G2 subset from 48 additional countries and territories with higher
COVID-19 prevalence during the early stages of the outbreak. For the G3 and G4 subsets, a total
of 7,507 and 3,196 SARS-CoV-2 samples, including both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of
20I/501Y.V1 and 20H/501Y.V2 clade, respectively, from 101 and 31 different countries and
territories around the world with reported cases of the virus and studied variants, were selected
for variant-focused phylogenies. 5,100 of all G3 samples including 17 Bangladeshi samples
(Dataset S3) belonged to the 20I/501Y.V1 clade, while 2,255 of all G4 samples along with 47
samples from Bangladesh (Dataset S4) belonged to the 20H/501Y.V2 clade. Sample submission

cutoff date similar to G1 subset had been applied to both G3 and G4 subsets. Additional daily
COVID-19 confirmed case related data of Bangladesh were downloaded from the World Health
Organization

(WHO)

website

(https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv).

Sample metadata of all subsets were checked in terms of data availability and any sample with
incomplete collection date were excluded. Prior to phylogenetic analysis, G2, G3 and G4 subset
samples were quality filtered and genome sequences with ambiguous characters were omitted.

2.2 Exploratory Data Analysis
The metadata of G1 subset samples was analyzed with Python version 3.8.527 to investigate the
Nextstrain clade distribution among divisions, as well as the gender and age-group distribution in
Bangladeshi samples. G1 samples with no division data were labeled NA (Not Available), and
the missing gender and age-group data were discarded before plotting with ggplot2 version
3.3.328 and tidyverse version 1.3.029 packages of R programming language version 3.6.330.

2.3 Phylogenetic Analysis
Quality filtered sequences of G2 subset were aligned to the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence
(NC_045512.2)31 using MAFFT version 7.47532. The aligned genomes were subsampled
afterwards. All 612 genomes from Bangladesh within the G2 subset were assigned as focal
samples during the subsampling process. In addition, 10 samples per month were chosen from 48

other countries and territories available in the subset based on genetic similarity to focal samples.
A total of 1,966 subsampled genomes were used to construct a maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic tree with IQ-TREE version 2.0.333, and further refined by TreeTime version 0.8.134.
The complete analysis pipeline is available online (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov, version
3). For visualization, auspice version 0.5.0 (https://auspice.us) by Nextstrain26 was used.
Analyses performed on G2 subset samples were also performed on both G3 and G4 subsets to
build phylogenetic trees for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants using 1,546 and 645 subsampled
genomes, respectively. During the subsampling process of both subsets, 5 samples a month were
selected for each country present in the corresponding subset except Bangladesh. The interactive
phylogenetic builds are available online at: https://github.com/nahid18/ncov-bd.

3. Results
3.1 Data Exploration for the current scenario of COVID-19 cases in Bangladesh
To better understand the current COVID-19 situation in Bangladesh, the pattern of daily reported
COVID-19 cases was analyzed. The highest peak of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases per day was
recently reported in the early April 2021 (Fig. 1A). The metadata of 1009 complete human-host
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh (Dataset S1) accessible via GISAID23 were examined.
The overall Nextstrain clade distribution across all the major divisional cities of Bangladesh
(Fig. 1B), reveals that samples from Dhaka and Sylhet divisions contain the 20I/501Y.V1 clade
and primarily start clustering around January 2021. Furthermore, samples from the Dhaka,
Chattogram, Khulna, and Mymensingh divisions include the 20H/501Y.V2 clade that has been
the most prevalent during March to April 2021. This raises the alarming possibility that these
VOCs are now dispersed in Bangladesh. We have also looked at the gender and age-group
distribution within the available samples and found out that samples from male patients are more
frequently sequenced in almost every age-group except 10-19, than female patients (Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Table S4).

3.2 Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates of Bangladesh
An independent phylogenetic analysis has been performed using a curated collection of 86,926
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences covering all regions and most countries/territories where the

COVID-19 infection rate was high during the early stages of the pandemic to precisely trace the
origin of initial SARS-CoV-2 isolates of Bangladesh. The generated phylogenetic tree containing
a total of 1,966 subsampled genomes, showed that all 612 high-coverage genome sequences
from Bangladesh are scattered across the tree (Fig. 2), suggesting multiple introductions of the
virus into the country, as well as grouped in several distinct clusters indicating community
transmission. The two well-defined clusters of Bangladeshi samples within 20B clade contain a
total of 482 descendants and share common ancestry with sequences isolated in Italy
(EPI_ISL_469050, EPI_ISL_494761, EPI_ISL_494774). In addition, multiple instances of
Bangladeshi samples with an estimated foreign origin have been found in 5 separate clades
distributed within the tree (Supplementary Table S5). In detail, Bangladeshi sample with

from

Bangladesh,

EPI_ISL_450339

and

EPI_ISL_450341, have high similarity with the Australian EPI_ISL_410718 sample of 19B
clade. Another Bangladeshi sample EPI_ISL_450345 within 19B clade is showing high
similarity with an Indian sample EPI_ISL_450324.
In addition to the large clusters of Bangladeshi samples, several clusters of few samples are
identified as well throughout the tree, indicating the local transmission on a smaller scale. Within
the 20A clade, EPI_ISL_445244 and 3 other samples from Bangladesh are close to Italian
EPI_ISL_412973 and EPI_ISL_451306 samples. A group of 10 Bangladeshi samples including
EPI_ISL_774877, EPI_ISL_605887 and EPI_ISL_774896 within the same clade have a shared
ancestry with the EPI_ISL_707964 sample isolated in Germany. Another group of 11
Bangladeshi clustered as 20A, including EPI_ISL_774900 and EPI_ISL_605910, are similar to
the Russian EPI_ISL_450288 sample. Similarly, a total of 19 Bangladeshi 20A samples
including EPI_ISL_466637 and EPI_ISL_450343 have close similarity to the EPI_ISL_513222
sample from Saudi Arabia. In addition, four samples within 20A clade from Bangladesh
including EPI_ISL_468070 and EPI_ISL_774893 are highly related to the sample
EPI_ISL_429255 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Indian EPI_ISL_435065,
and South African EPI_ISL_450299 sample have close resemblance to the Bangladeshi
EPI_ISL_477134 and EPI_ISL_605889 samples of the 20A clade, respectively.
Although most of the 20B samples from Bangladesh are found to have Italian ancestry, samples
from the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and New Zealand are also showing high

similarity to Bangladeshi clustered detected across the 20B clade. EPI_ISL_477130,
EPI_ISL_774889, EPI_ISL_774890 and 5 other samples from Bangladesh are closely related to
the EPI_ISL_488766 sample from the United Kingdom. A total of 10 samples from Bangladesh
including EPI_ISL_483630 and EPI_ISL_464162 are close to the EPI_ISL_579166 sample
isolated in New Zealand. Moreover, a combined set of 8 Bangladeshi samples of 20B clade in 3
separate groups are closely related to 3 samples with GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_520738,
EPI_ISL_520717 and EPI_ISL_528686 from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In 20C clade,
Bangladeshi EPI_ISL_477128 sample is highly similar to the EPI_ISL_614672 and
EPI_ISL_614674 samples from Denmark.
Based on the evidence indicated by the phylogenetic tree, it is evident that SARS-CoV-2 isolates
have been introduced into Bangladesh from several countries of all regions, except South
America, during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. Multiple introductions from a single country
such as Italy, India and UAE have occurred as well.

3.3 Phylogenetic analysis of B.1.1.7 variant samples in Bangladesh as compared to other
countries
A time-resolved phylogenetic tree was created containing 1,546 subsampled genomes including
641 samples of B.1.1.7 variant to develop a better understanding of the evolutionary relationship
and potential propagation patterns of this variant in Bangladesh. All 17 Bangladeshi samples are
found scattered across the 20I/501Y.V1 clade within the tree (Fig. 3), suggesting multiple viral
introductions into Bangladesh from several countries (Supplementary Table S6). The sample
EPI_ISL_1360439 from Bangladesh is closely related to the sample EPI_ISL_756846 isolated in
the United Kingdom. Another Bangladeshi sample EPI_ISL_906098 is highly similar to a
sample EPI_ISL_837380 from Ireland. Two samples- EPI_ISL_1508943 and EPI_ISL_1508946,
are close to the EPI_ISL_1118931 sample from Indonesia. A total of 6 samples including
EPI_ISL_1509000 and EPI_ISL_1360451 are related to the Nigerian EPI_ISL_985080,
EPI_ISL_872625

samples.

Three

(EPI_ISL_995709), Australia (EPI_ISL_812441) and Spain (EPI_ISL_1059975), respectively.

3.4 Phylogenetic analysis of B.1.351 variant Bangladeshi samples in a global point of view

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.24.444482; this version posted May 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

In order to identify the origin of the B.1.351 variant isolates in Bangladesh, we analyzed 3,196
samples from 31 countries and territories, the bulk of which were B.1.351 variant. The resulting
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) generated from the 645 subsampled sequences, reveals 46 out of 47
B.1351 variant samples of Bangladesh clustered under a single node within 20H/501Y.V2 clade,
manifesting clear signs of local transmission with single ancestral source, with paternal node
being shared with samples isolated in South Africa. Samples from France and Turkey are placed
close to the Bangladeshi samples in the phylogenetic tree. The remaining lone sample
(EPI_ISL_1508892) that did not cluster with other samples had the closest ancestral genotype of
United States origin (EPI_ISL_1097839). Based on the data (Supplementary Table S7), it is
highly likely that South Africa and the United States are the estimated origins to have introduced
the B.1.351 variant to Bangladesh.

Discussions
As the global pandemic of COVID-19 progresses, new SARS-CoV-2 variants that are highly
pathogenic and possibly more transmissible in nature than pre-existing variants continues to
emerge due to mutational changes in the viral genome, causing a second wave of COVID-19 in
several regions and countries around the world35,36. From the COVID-19 confirmed cases data, a
severe second wave is detected in Bangladesh from late March to early April 2020 (Fig. 1A) as
compared to the first wave of April to August 20207. The exploratory analysis on Bangladeshi
genomic sequences reveals a high prevalence of B.1.351 variants could be a major determining
factor for the second wave of COVID-19 in the country, which is consistent with an already
published study22. Moreover, we have reported that both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variant samples in
Bangladesh are now dispersed in several divisions of Bangladesh including Dhaka, Sylhet,
Chattogram, Mymensingh, and Khulna (Fig. 1B). A continuous trend of male-female disparity in
terms of sample sequencing in almost every age group was observed (Fig. 1C), with more male
patient samples being sequenced than female patient samples. This is most likely attributed to the
fact that male COVID-19 patients has a far higher infection and mortality rate than females, as
several studies have reported similar gender-based differentiation of COVID-19 severity in
Bangladesh37,38. Biological sex plays an important role in the COVID-19 infection outcome by
manifesting the infection susceptibility, pathogenesis, innate and adaptive immune responses,
level of inflammation, and capacity of tissue repair. Presence of a more robust T cell activation

mechanism and higher levels of innate immune cytokines in female as compared to male
patients, could be the possible explanation for this kind of gender biasness in COVID-1939. A
male dominance in COVID-19 mortality rate has been consistent with the other viral
pathogenesis37.
Phylogenetic analyses on all the subsets have helped us to unravel the estimated origins of
SARS-CoV-2 isolates as well as both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants in Bangladesh. Based on the
evidence presented in the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2-4), a total of 17 unique countries from all
regions of the world, except South America, have collectively introduced initial SARS-CoV-2
isolates as well as two analyzed VOCs into Bangladesh (Fig 5). Of these countries, initial
Bangladeshi samples are showing similarity with the sequences reported from Italy, India, UK,
Saudi Arabia, UAE, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, DRC, US, Russia, and
Denmark. A subset of these countries was reported to be the estimated origins of SARS-CoV-2
in Bangladesh in few other studies25,40. Multiple introductions from a single country including
Italy, India, UK, Saudi Arabia have occurred as well. Furthermore, B.1.1.7 variant samples of
Bangladesh are found to have close similarity to the samples from UK, India, Nigeria, Spain,
Ireland, Australia, and Indonesia. In case of B.1.351 variant, it is highly possible that South
Africa and the USA are the estimated origins of this variant in Bangladesh. It is evident from
these findings that multiple variants from several countries including UK, India, South Africa,
US, and Australia have arrived in Bangladesh because of regional and intercontinental travel.
Based on the widespread distribution of several distinct clusters throughout the phylogenetic
tree, these foreign isolates might be transmitted locally in different areas of Bangladesh during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Findings from this study should be taken into consideration within the context of a few caveats.
During the subsampling process, a fixed number of samples were selected for the final grouping,
hence may not be included all foreign samples that are possibly close to the focal samples.
Besides, samples for the variant phylogenies may be biased towards the country of initial
emergence of the variants. Despite these limitations, the findings regarding the origin of these
variants are very alarming and should be brought to the notice of policymakers and public health
authorities right away to prevent further escalation of viral transmission on a community level in
Bangladesh.

Conclusions
This study illustrates the contribution of both regional and intercontinental travel in the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 VOCs in Bangladesh. As the pandemic continues to unfold, continuous genomic
surveillance is required to strictly monitor the pattern of viral epidemiology. Given how quickly
new variants can propagate across the world due to air travel without being detected for a long
time, these findings are critical for administrative authorities and public health officials in terms
of implementing effective interventions and guidelines including but not limited to travel
restrictions and mandatory quarantine or lockdown measurements to determine the proliferation
of these variants in Bangladesh. The ever-changing circulation pattern of SARS-CoV-2 variants
in Bangladesh needs further surveillance as these findings have serious repercussions for
mitigation and vaccination strategies. Immunization efforts must also be continued and enforced
to keep the infection rates down.
