Abstract
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a versatile technique for
detection of target DNA and RNA, enabling rapid molecular diagnostic assays with
minimal equipment. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented an urgent need
for new and better diagnostic methods, with colorimetric LAMP utilized in numerous
studies for SARS-CoV-2 detection. However, the sensitivity of colorimetric LAMP in
early reports has been below that of the standard RT-qPCR tests, and we sought to
improve performance. Here we report the use of guanidine hydrochloride and combined
primer sets to increase speed and sensitivity in colorimetric LAMP, bringing this simple
method up to the standards of sophisticated technique and enabling accurate and highthroughput diagnostics.

Introduction
Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed as a simple
nucleic acid amplification technique that reliably detects target sequence at a single

reaction temperature without the need for sophisticated thermal cycling equipment (1).
Advances in various detection technologies have helped establish LAMP as a useful
and versatile tool for molecular diagnostics (2). Previously we reported a reliable visual
detection method based on pH change during LAMP (3), enabling simple and low-cost
applications suitable for point of care or field diagnostics. Colorimetric LAMP has been
used in a range of applications: a large scale survey of Wolbachia-containing mosquitos
(4); Grapevine red blotch virus without DNA extraction (5); testing urine samples for
Zika virus (6) for example. In addition to use at the point of need, this detection method
is amenable to medium- to high-throughput screening of large amounts of samples.
The recent and ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created an
urgent demand for molecular diagnostics, requiring rapid creation of accurate and
sensitive tests at unprecedented scale. LAMP presents an attractive option for
diagnostic testing due to compatibility with simple colorimetric detection and relatively
unpurified sample input and several studies have demonstrated its usage in diagnostics
of SARS-CoV-2 (7-13) including potential utility for both simple, rapid testing and higher
throughput applications (11, 13). To date these studies have demonstrated excellent
specificity with LAMP, however, sensitivity has generally been lower than typical RTqPCR assays (e.g. 87.5% sensitivity as compared to a standard RT-qPCR test) (14).
Accordingly, we set out to improve the sensitivity of RT-LAMP, screening new
and published primer sets for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and identified two sets with
marked increase in sensitivity. We also screened many compounds and reaction
conditions for improving LAMP speed and detection sensitivity, with the addition of
guanidine hydrochloride providing a notable enhancement to both. Here we describe

these studies and the performance improvement resulting from use of guanidine and
the combination of primer sets together in one LAMP reaction. Additionally, use of
absorbance measurement of the color change of the pH sensitive dye phenol red
enabled more sensitive detection of low-copy amplification, reliably calling positive
amplification down to 10 copies of input RNA in 30 minutes. These modifications to
standard RT-LAMP conditions will further the ability of LAMP to support sensitive
molecular diagnostic tests, for the current COVID crisis and future diagnostic needs.
Results
In order to improve the amplification in RT-LAMP reactions, we screened a range
of compounds and additives commonly used to enhance PCR or other isothermal
methods (e.g. DMSO, poly(ethylene glycol) compounds, betaine, single-stranded DNA
binding proteins). While most of these compounds had no, very little, or negative effects
on LAMP, we found that guanidine chloride showed dramatic improvement of speed on
LAMP (Fig. 1A). Other guanidine containing compounds such as guanidine thiocyanate
and arginine were also found to have a stimulatory effect, but with a narrower workable
range and accordingly we focused on guanidine hydrochloride. We determined that an
optimal range of guanidine chloride concentration for 3 primer sets used in SARS-CoV2 RNA detection and all showed the greatest stimulation at around 40â€“50 mM when
used with the colorimetric LAMP master mix (Fig. 1B), indicating the stimulation is likely
general to colorimetric LAMP and not specific to a particular primer set.
Using this optimal concentration of guanidine, we checked the speed
enhancement with four SARS-CoV-2 RNA primer sets (two for Gene N (N, N2), one for
Gene E (E1) and a published set for Orf1a (As1e)) using 10,000 copies of synthetic

SARS-CoV-2 RNA template and one primer set for human beta actin (ACTB), often
used as an extraction control assay for patient samples, with 1 ng of total Jurkat RNA
template (Fig 1C-D). Addition of guanidine increased LAMP speed by nearly 2-fold for
three of the primer sets: 21.3 minutes (threshold time from CFX-96 instrument) to 11
minutes for the N2 primer set; 16.7 min to 10.2 for the E1 primer set; and 18.3 minutes
to 9.2 minutes for the As1e primer set. The N primer set showed less stimulation (17.4
to 13.3 minutes) as did the already very fast ACTB primer set (11 to 8.14 minutes). On
average together for all five primer sets, guanidine chloride shortened the time to
threshold detection by 6.6 minutes or ~40%. Importantly, this increase in detection
speed did not cause any increase in no-template control amplification with any of the
five primer sets (Fig. 1A, Fig. 2C-D), indicating the stimulation by guanidine is specific to
the interaction between primers and their intended templates.
Having observed such a significant effect on reaction speed, we next examined
whether guanidine also has an effect on LAMP amplification sensitivity using lower RNA
template inputs. By monitoring the reaction in real time, we found that guanidine also
significantly shortened the reaction time with low template input (Fig. 2A) at a similar
degree to that with high template input observed above. For scoring positive
amplification, we relied on end point scoring based on the color change from pink to
yellow (Fig. 2B), with results concordant with real time observation. Multiple reactions
were performed for four primer sets using 100 or 50 copies of synthetic SARS-CoV-2
RNA. In all cases, guanidine significantly improved the percentage of positive detection.
With 100 copies of RNA template, the detection percentage increased from just below
50% without guanidine to over 90% when it was added to reactions with the N2, E1 and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.132894; this version posted June 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

As1e primer sets, with primer set N showing increase from 40% to 74% (Fig. 2E). For
50 copies, the percentage increased from lower 30% to around 70% (Fig. 2F) for sets
N2, As1e, and E1. Overall, in the presence of guanidine, it is possible to successfully
amplify for about 50% for 25 copies of input, slightly higher than that for 100 copies
without guanidine. This accordingly indicates an increase in sensitivity of approximately
4-fold by including 40 mM guanidine hydrochloride in the LAMP reaction.
As each primer set was designed to detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA sequence, combining two primer sets could potentially increase detection if there
is no interference of the two primer sets. We tested this idea in pair wise combinations
of the most sensitive LAMP primer sets (N2, E1, As1e) as well as using the three primer
sets together. In these combination reactions, the concentration of each primer set was
kept the same as in the reaction with only a single set, so the total primer concentration
is doubled and tripled respectively. Based on the real time curves of these reactions, in
the presence of guanidine, amplification in double and triple primer reactions started
much earlier than without guanidine (Fig.3A). Almost all positive reactions started at a
similar early timepoint, while those without guanidine initiated at scattered times much
later. For the end point color change scoring, the color changed from pink to yellow
completely in the presence of guanidine while the color change is only partial in no
guanidine reactions (Fig. 3B), reflecting the slower amplification.
In the absence of guanidine, the detection rate with double primers and 50
copies of RNA template only showed a slight increase, from just below 30% to 40% (Fig.
2C and 3C). The positive rate for triple primer set was higher, measured at 67%. When
guanidine was added, all combinations showed a positive rate of over 92% with the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.132894; this version posted June 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

triple primer set at 100% (Fig 3D). When even lower templates were tested, 25 copies
were detected nearly 75% of the time with dual primer combinations and 92% with the
triple primer reactions. With 12.5 copies this rate was 45% for dual and 61% tripleprimer reactions, 5 copies 20% and 45%. In all of the dual and triple primer combination
tests, there was no signal in NTC reactions when incubated to 40 minutes (Fig. 3A-B).
Given the improvement in positive detection rate, we estimate dual primer combination
in the presence of guanidine can almost double the detection frequency of SARS-CoV-2
RNA, and more than doubled with all three primers.
The increased detection frequency using dual or triple primers seemed to follow
a simple combined detection probability. Based on the detection frequency of 50 or 25
copies of single primer set (Fig. 2F), theoretical combined detection probabilities of all
combinations were calculated assuming each primer set detects its target independently
and there is no interference between any combination. These predicted numbers
strongly correlate with the actual detected frequency (Fig. 3D) for both 50 and 25 copies
(Fig. 3E). We also tested whether the increased detection is due to a simple primer
concentration increase. When the concentration of a single primer set (N2) was
increased to 2- or 3-fold to match the total primer concentration of the dual- and tripleprimer reactions, we found there was no increased detection frequency (data not
shown). However, there was noticeable increase of NTC signal. Thus, increased
sensitivity is not due to simply more primer being available, but rather more due to
LAMP reactions of multiple primer sets occurring independently at the same time, and
effectively increasing the available number of templates for the same target.

Next we sought to improve detection sensitivity and evaluate high-throughput
compatibility by quantitatively detecting the colorimetric change of our reactions using
spectrophotometric measurements. We combined the optimal guanidine hydrochloride
concentration (40mM) with the dual primer sets (N2 and E1) described above and
performed colorimetric LAMP reactions with a 2-fold dilution series of synthetic COVID19 RNA. Using the ratio of absorbance measurements of the two phenol red peaks
(yellow Abs432/ pink Abs560) as the primary metric, we observed a positive correlation
with copy number (Figure 4). Applying a threshold of 0.704, equivalent to the 99.7%
confidence interval (Î¼NTC + 3ßªNTC) of NTC (n=8), we determined that 100% of all
samples containing 20-160 copies rxn-1 tested positive. Notably, 62.5% of samples
containing only 10 copies rxn-1 also tested positive, illustrating a marked improvement
on sensitivity. These reactions were incubated for only 20 minutes, with the more
sensitive instrumented measurement enabling calling positives much earlier than
detection simply by eye.
Discussion
We present here a significant increase in the speed and sensitivity of RT-LAMP
reactions by addition of guanidine hydrochloride. This effect is compounded by
additional enhancement of combining two or three LAMP primer sets, enabled by
guanidine and resulting in additional improvement in sensitivity without increase in
nonspecific amplification. These enhanced reactions also make it possible to utilize
shorter detection times and better discrimination of color change with the colorimetric
LAMP detection based on pH-sensitive dye.

This report describes the enhancement of RT-LAMP by addition of guanidine
chloride, yet the mechanism of its action is yet to be elucidated. Based on its consistent
enhancement of reactions with different primer sets, we speculate that guanidine
enhances the base pairing between primers and their target sequences. Consistent with
this interpretation, it also significantly shortens the reaction time for helicase-dependent
amplification (data not shown). It is unlikely due to the modulation of enzyme activity, as
additional enzyme, either reverse transcriptase or Bst 2.0 DNA polymerase, did not
have such an effect. While the primary focus here is RT-LAMP reactions, the guanidine
enhancement is equally effective with LAMP using DNA inputs (data not shown).
Measurement with an absorbance plate reader also demonstrated a notable
increase in reaction sensitivity, clearly calling reaction positives that would have been
indeterminate at best by visual detection. While visual readout is well-suited to simple
field and point-of-care applications, endpoint reading of plates by absorbance provides
a quantitative data record more amenable to high-throughput settings. Plates (96- or
384-well) could be incubated in simple heating chambers and endpoint absorbance
used for analysis, and if paired with liquid handling plate filling a large number of
samples could be processed with the simple 20â€“40 minute heating at 65 Â°C and
endpoint plate read. One example of this workflow is shown in Figure 5, with automated
liquid handling and nucleic acid extraction for plate setup, followed by heating in an
oven and measurement of absorbance to determine presence/absence of target. An
Emergency Use Authorization was recently granted to Color Genomics for a SARSCoV-2 test much as laid out here, proving the principle as a potential high-throughput
workflow. Taken together, the improvements to LAMP presented here describe a

utilized for molecular diagnostics.
Materials and Methods
LAMP primers targeting different regions of SARS-CoV-2 sequence (GenBank
accession number MN908947) were designed using the online software Primer Explorer
V5 (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/). Primers N (14) and As1e (12) appeared in previous
preprints. We screened 7 additional new primer sets and found that N2 and E1 gave
best performance. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. Oligos were synthesized at
Integrated DNA Technologies with standard desalting. Synthetic COVID-19 RNA
containing equal ratio of most viral genome regions was purchased from Twist
Bioscience (Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 2 (MN908947.3) - SKU: 102024),
which came at a concentration of 1 million copies per ul. The RNA was diluted to lower
concentrations in 10ng/ul Jurkat total RNA and their concentration were estimated using
RT-qPCR with primer and probe sets for CDC N1 and CharitÃ©/Berlin Gene E. RT-LAMP
reactions were performed using WarmStartÂ® Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (DNA &
RNA) (M1800) supplemented with 1 Î¼M SYTOÂ®-9 double-stranded DNA binding dye
(Thermo Fisher S34854) and incubated on a real-time qPCR machine (BioRad CFX96)
for 107 cycles with signal acquisition for every 15 seconds (total incubation time ~40
min). The color of the finished reactions was recorded using an office flatbed scanner.
Guanidine chloride solution was made with Sigma RDD001 and adjusted to pH ~8 with
KOH before adding to the colorimetric LAMP reaction.
For plate reader absorbance measurement we applied an ABI MicroAmp seal to the
Bio-Rad HSP9601 microplate and incubated the reactions at 65Â°C for 20 min in a

RNA (TWIST; 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 0 copies rxn-1) at 65Â°C for 20 min and endpoint
absorbance at 432nm and 560nm was determined after a rapid cooling step. The ratio
of the two absorbance readings (Abs432/Abs560) is plotted against the corresponding
RNA copy number (n = 8). The mean for each group is displayed in orange. Results
indicate a positive correlation between absorbance ratio and copy number (Î¼ Â± ßª:
160cp â€“ 1.410 Â± 0.017; 80cp â€“ 1.383 Â± 0.084; 40cp â€“ 1.321 Â± 0.084; 20cp â€“ 1.190 Â±
0.200; 10cp â€“ 1.015 Â± 0.298; NTC â€“ 0.679 Â± 0.008), and suggest that simple, endpoint
spectrophotometric analyses provide a rapid and sensitive approach for the detection of
COVID-19 RNA by Colorimetric LAMP.
