Abstract
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronoavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent
of COVID-19 illness, has caused over 2 million infections worldwide in four months. In SARS
coronaviruses, the non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) methylates the 5’-end of virally encoded

28

mRNAs to mimic cellular mRNAs, thus protecting the virus from host innate immune restriction.
We report here the high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of full-length nsp16 and nsp10
of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of cognate RNA substrate and a methyl donor, S-adenosyl
methionine. The nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer was captured in the act of 2’-O methylation of the

32

ribose sugar of the first nucleotide of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We reveal large conformational
changes associated with substrate binding as the enzyme transitions from a binary to a ternary
state. This structure provides new mechanistic insights into the 2’-O methylation of the viral mRNA
cap. We also discovered a distantly located ligand-binding site unique to SARS-CoV-2 that may

36

serve as an alternative target site for antiviral development.

Introduction
The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes SARS-CoV-2 one of the

40

deadliest virus in recent history1. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding
of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARSCoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded β-coronavirus with a large, complex RNA
genome2. To hijack the host translation machinery for propagation, enzymes encoded by the

44

genome of coronaviruses (CoVs) modify the 5’-end of virally encoded mRNAs by creating a cap3.
RNA capping in CoVs involves activities of several nonstructural proteins (nsps): nsp13, a
bifunctional RNA/NTP triphosphatase (TPase) and helicase; nsp14, a bifunctional 3’à5’
mismatch exonuclease and mRNA cap guanine-N7 methyltransferase; nsp16, a ribose 2’-O

48

methyltransferase; and an elusive guanylyl transferase4-7.

Nsp16 forms an obligatory complex with nsp10 to efficiently convert client mRNA species from
the Cap-0 (me7GopppA1) to the Cap-1 form (me7GopppA1m), by methylating the ribose 2’-O of the

52

first nucleotide (usually adenosine in CoVs) of the nascent mRNA using SAM (S-adenosyl
methionine) as the methyl donor

4, 8

. This Cap-1 form serves to avoid induction of the innate

immune response9-11. Hence, ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to
CoV infection and limit pathogenesis9, 10. It has been shown that live vaccination with nsp16-

56

defective SARS-CoV-1 or an immunogenic disruption of the nsp16-nsp10 interface protects mice
from an otherwise lethal challenge12, 13, making nsp16/nsp10 an attractive drug target.

Crystal structures of SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 in complex with SAM/SAH or sinefungin, but

60

without an RNA substrate, have been reported

4, 8, 14

, so that key information about the catalytic

mechanism of mRNA capping in CoVs, and SARS-CoV-2 in particular, is still missing. To
understand the determinants of RNA cap modification and help guide the development of SARSCoV-2 antiviral therapies, we have now succeeded in solving the high-resolution structure (to 1.8

Å resolution) of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16/nsp10 in complex with the methyl donor (SAM) and its target,
the RNA cap analog me7GopppA1. Moreover, we co-crystallized this complex with a series of FDAapproved drugs and found that one such compound, adenosine, associates with a probable
allosteric ligand binding site not present in the nsp16/nsp10 orthologues from other SARS or pan-

68

coronavirus strains. Thus, we provide a plausible novel framework from which SARS-CoV-2
inhibitors may be developed.

Results

72

We co-purified full-length SARS CoV-2 nsp16 and nsp10 proteins as a complex from E. coli,
mixed with nucleoside drugs such as adenosine or 5’-methylthioadenosine and subjected to
crystallization screenings (see Methods for details). We anticipated that these drugs may occupy
the binding site of SAM due to common features of both, a purine ring plus ribose. Since

76

nucleoside analogues exhibit antiviral activity15-17, a nsp16/nsp10/adenosine complex could then
serve as a starting point for medicinal chemistry and perhaps rapid translation. Next, we soaked
these crystals with a cap analogue me7GopppA1 representing the Cap-0 state of the RNA cap, the
substrate of this complex. We determined the ternary structure of nsp16/nsp10 by molecular

80

replacement using the SARS-CoV-1/SAM binary complex (PDB ID 3R24)8 structure as a template
(Supplementary Table 1). The initial difference maps indicated electron densities of SAM and
me7

GopppA1 cap in their respective binding pockets. Even though SAM was not included in co-

crystallization or soaking experiments, its electron density was unambiguously identified in

84

difference maps (Fig. 1, 2, Supplementary Fig. 2A). This observation is consistent with the copurification tendency of SAM during isolation from expression hosts, as seen previously with NS5
of ZIKA and VP39 of vaccinia virus cap 2’-O MTases

18, 19

. Unexpectedly, we observed electron

density on the opposite face of nsp16, >25 Å away from the catalytic pocket that could fit

88

adenosine (present in our crystallization mixture) reasonably well (Figure 1, Supplementary Fig.

2, 3). Further examination showed that this adenosine-binding pocket was partially composed of
amino acid residues unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1)

92

Overall structure
Nsp16 adopts a canonical S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase (SAMMTase) fold20 with slight variations

8, 14

. Its protein sequence displays a sequential order of

secondary structural element: •β1α1α2β2α3β3β4•β5β6•α4β7α5β8•β9α6•β10•α7β11β12, wherein

96

the ‘•’ denotes a 310-helix (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). The nsp16 MTase fold consists of a
centrally located twisted β sheet of eight strands flanked by two alpha-helices on one side and
three helices on the other. The β sheet displays a continuum of four antiparallel (β1β8β9β7) and
four parallel (β6β2β3β4) β strands. The cap analogue substrate is situated within the confluence

100

of these two halves. Loops emanating from strands β9, β7, and β6 form a deep groove in the
center to accommodate the RNA cap, whereas the methyl donor SAM is bound within a cavity
formed by the loops originating from strands β6 and β2. The protein chain emerging from helix α4
runs across this groove and folds into a subdomain (•β10•α7β11β12) that stabilizes the bottom

104

portion of nsp16. The adenosine binding pocket is at the back of the catalytic pocket, ~ 25 Å away
(Fig. 1).

Nsp10 is a 139 amino acid long zinc-binding protein that stimulates the enzymatic activity of nsp16

108

4, 8, 14

. We traced all functional regions known for protein-protein and protein-metal binding in

nsp10, with the exception of the N-terminal 17 residues that appear to be disordered in our
structure, but form an α-helix in the binary state in the absence of a cap structure

4, 8, 14

. Nsp10

adopts a structural fold with two distinct Zn-binding modules, including a gag-knuckle-like fold 21.

112

Binding of the RNA cap did not induce any major conformational change in nsp10.

We compared our ternary structure with bound substrate to that of SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10

116

bound to SAM (PDB ID 3R24), but without substrate. While the cores of the nsp16 and nsp10
proteins remain largely unperturbed (with an RMSD of 1.11 Å for 292 Cα atoms between the prior
CoV-1 structure and our own), we found significant deviations in two regions of nsp16 that
constitute the substrate binding pocket. We refer to these regions as gate loop 1 (amino acids 20

120

- 40) and gate loop 2 (amino acids 133 – 143) (Fig. 2). The binding of the Cap-0 substrate results
in an ~180° outward rotation of gate loops 1 and 2 by 7 Å and 5.2 Å, respectively compared to
their positions in the binary structure. The widening of the pocket that results allows
accommodation of the RNA cap substrate, and engages the N7-methyl guanosine base of Cap-0

124

(me7Go) in a deep groove formed by residues of gate loop 1 on one side and gate loop 2 on the
other (Fig. 2A, B, D, F). The loop region immediately downstream of Pro134 that is part of gate
loop 2 also flips ~180º in the ternary complex to accommodate the A1 nucleotide (Fig. 2A). Gln28
and Asn29 (gate loop 1) orient outward, whereas the side chain of invariant Tyr30 rotates inward,

128

thereby forming a cleft to stabilize the purine ring of me7Go through a π-π stacking interaction.

The opposite face of the

me7

Go purine ring is stabilized by a H-bond between terminal oxygen of

Glu173 and the positively charged N7 of

132

me7

Go. The methyl group of

me7

Go is stabilized by

hydrophobic interactions with Cys25 (gate loop 1) and Ser202 from the loop connecting the β8
and β9 strands. These specific interactions with the positively charged N7 and the methyl moiety
of the me7Go base would confer substrate selectivity against the uncharged GopppA 4. In gate loop
2, Asn138 rotates outward and the side chain of invariant Lys137 rotates ~180º inward and forms

136

stabilizing electrostatic interactions with all 3 phosphates of the Cap-0 structure and the 3’-O of
the

me7

Go ribose. Tyr30 and Lys137 form a partial enclosure to restrict the movement of the

terminal residue (me7Go) of the RNA cap (Fig. 2B, D). The backbone of gate loop 1 runs
perpendicular to the purine ring of me7Go such that the backbone amide of Leu27 forms a hydrogen

140

bond with O6 of

me7

Go to confer specificity for guanine. The ribose sugar of

me7

Go is sandwiched

by the sidechains of Lys137 and His174 in gate loop 2 (Fig. 2B, D). The three phosphates of
me7

GopppA1 are stabilized through H-bonds with residues located in the loop regions emanating

from the β6 (Tyr132, Lys137), β7 (Thr172 and His174) and β8 (Ser 201 and Ser 202) strands

144

(Fig. 2D). By comparing our structure with those for the 2’O-MTases of Dengue and Vaccinia
viruses, we note that the distance between N1 and me7Go bases remains unchanged (~10 Å), and
the SAM/SAH and N1 in all 3 structures overlay well, but the terminal

me7

Go base of CoV-2 RNA

cap rotates ~180º (compared to Dengue virus) around the 𝛄-phosphate to assume a radically

148

different orientation, suggesting a diverse geometric arrangement of the RNA cap in RNA/DNA
viruses (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

Methyl donor (SAM) binding

152

SAM occupies the same pocket and orients in a similar manner as in the binary complex (PDB ID
3R24). Several loops emanating from the C-terminal ends of the four parallel β strands (β2, β3,
β4, and β6) of the central β sheet form a deep groove to accommodate SAM through an extensive
network of electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions (Fig. 2C, F). In contrast to

156

the substrate pocket, which is largely basic, the SAM binding pocket in nsp16 is enriched by
negatively charged residues (Fig. 1B). The side chains of Asp99 and Asn101 from strand β3 form
hydrogen bonds with terminal oxygens of the ribose sugar, whereas the purine ring of SAM is
partially circled by side chains of Leu100 (β3) Asp114, Cys115 (β4), and Met131 (β6), and Trp149.

160

Asp114 makes a base-specific interaction with SAM via a hydrogen bond with the N6 amino group
of the purine ring. A four amino acid long stretch (Met131 to Pro134) that corresponds to gate
loop 2 intrudes into the SAM and cap binding pockets and separates the two purine rings of SAM
and A1 (the target adenine) by ~10 Å. This separation favorably orients the ribose sugar of A1 and

164

the donor methyl group of SAM for 2’-O methylation. The carboxy end of SAM is stabilized by
charged interactions from the side chains of Asn43 and Tyr47 and the backbone amide of Gly81
(Fig. 2C).

Methylation of target adenine of RNA cap
Based on the crystal structures of SAM and SAH-bound SARS-CoV-1 nsp16/nsp10 complexes,
a catalytic mechanism that involves a tetrad consisting of the invariant Lys46, Asp130, Lys170,
and Glu203 has been proposed

172

8, 14

. Our ternary complex has allowed us to examine the model

in the presence of the Cap-0 substrate. The catalytic pocket adopts a conical shape where
residues of the catalytic tetrad circle a water molecule at the ‘bottom’ of the cone, whereas the
target atom (2’-O) of the A1 nucleotide resides at the ‘tip’ of the cone. In addition, two invariant
asparagine residues - Asn43 and Asn198 - outside of the catalytic tetrad stabilize the water

176

molecule and the 3’-end of the target nucleotide (A1) in the RNA cap, respectively. The methyl
group of SAM is positioned 3 Å from the 2’-OH of A1, available for a direct in line attack from the
2’-OH (Fig. 2C, E). Supporting this concept, nsp16/nsp10 showed robust 2’-O methyltransferase
activity. We also observed marked reduction in activity when the initiating nucleotide (N1) was

180

changed from the cognate adenine to non-cognate base guanine (Fig. 2G). Similar observations
were made by previous biochemical studies8, but the structural basis of this base discrimination
was not clear. There is no base specific contact exists for the N1 base in ternary structure.
However, modeling of a guanine (G) base at this position provides some clues. The Pro134

184

resides at Van der Waals distance from purine ring of the N1 base. A guanine at N1 will not alter
this interaction but the N2 amino group of guanine intrudes into the SAM pocket thereby reducing
the distance between guanine and SAM by ~0.7 Å. As a result, positively charged sulfur of SAM
may repel purine ring of guanine and thus re-orients its target sugar 2’-OH in an unfavorable

188

position for methyl transfer (Fig. 2H).

An earlier study posits that the target 2’-OH of the ribose in a ternary complex would initially
occupy the position of the water, allowing Asp203 and Lys170 to lower the pKa of the 𝛆-amino

192

group of Lys46. As a result, Lys46 would become a deprotonated general base and activate the

2’-OH to attack the methyl group of SAM14 with Asp130 stabilizing the positive charge of the
methyl group14. In our ternary structure, this water molecule resides 3 Å from the target 2’-OH of
the A1 base ribose and remains unperturbed in the ternary structure of SARS-CoV-2 (present

196

study) and binary structures (SAM/SAH-bound) of SARS-CoV-18, 14 nsp16. If the ribose were to
occupy the position of water as suggested

14

, the adenine ring of A1 would sterically clash with

SAM. In addition, Lys170 is closer to the 2’OH than Lys46 (Fig. 2E) and is held in place by charged
interactions from the side chains of Asp130 and Glu203 from both sides. Consistent with this

200

logic, Lys170 in our ternary complex structure spatially matches with that activating the 2’-OH in
other viral 2’-O MTases (e.g., Lys180 of dengue virus NS522, and Lys175 of vaccinia virus VP3923)
. Thus, Lys170 likely acts as a general base during 2’-O methyl transfer in SARS-CoV-2. One
possible role of the water molecule is that it co-operates with Asp130 to transiently stabilize the

204

transfer of the positively charged methyl group from SAM to 2’-O of A1 base. We propose that
once occupied by SAM, the catalytic pocket is primed for A1 base binding and catalysis. This may
be a general mechanism for 2’-O methylation for all coronaviruses. Although all components
required for methylation are present in our crystals, we have not observed methylation of 2’-OH,

208

possibly due to a requirement for additional RNA sequence downstream of the target A1 base8.
Thus, the ternary structure that we have described may represent a pre-reaction state of 2’-O
methyl transfer.

212

Acquired mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and their implications
Next, to better understand the role of acquired mutations in SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 (compared to
CoV-1), we aligned nsp16 sequences from 9 coronavirus strains representing all three sub
classes (α, β, and 𝛾), and mapped their positions in the current structure (Supplementary Fig.

216

1). Although most residues that participate in catalysis and substrate/SAM binding are conserved
across species, notable differences were found (Supplementary Fig. 1, 3B). Compared to CoV1, acquired mutations span the entire nsp16 sequence: E32D and N33S (gate loop1); K135R

(gate loop 2); and S188A, A209C, T223V, N265G, Y272L, E276S, V290I, and I294V

220

(Supplementary Fig. 1, 3B). Given the role of gate loop regions in RNA substrate binding,
mutations E32D and N35S in gate loop 1 and K135R in gate loop 2 may influence RNA binding
or enzyme kinetics.

224

Three specific mutations – S188A (β8), A209C (β9), and E276S (α6) forms part of the adenosine
binding pocket. Two of the mutations A209C (β9), and E276S (α6) are not present in any other
CoV strain, whereas S188A, is present in one human strain (HKU1), two avian strains (TCoV and
IBV) and one mouse strain (MHV) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3). At ~ 25 Å away, and on the

228

back of the catalytic center, this ligand binding pocket does not present obvious characteristics
for adenine specificity such as an aspartic acid or asparagine residue, which would usually make
a hydrogen bond with the N6 amino group of adenines. Nonetheless, it displays two similarities
with the SAM binding pocket: the purine ring in both pockets resides in an acidic environment,

232

and both pockets harbor a cysteine near N6 of the purine ring. In the SAM pocket, Cys115 is 4.1
Å from the N6 amino group and positioned at a ~ 64º angle between N1 and the C6 atoms of the
adenine ring with respect to Cys115 (Fig. 2C). An equivalent cysteine in the adenosine pocket,
Cys209, resides at 3.5 Å, and at a ~ 85º angle from the N6 of adenine. The purine ring of

236

adenosine is further stabilized by stacking interactions with Trp198 and Thr58, and its 5’ tail, while
exposed to solvent, interacts with Asn13 (Fig. 3A). Thus, the lack of extensive interactions for
adenosine suggests that this pocket is somewhat non-specific but can accommodate small
molecules with a heterocyclic ring. Interestingly, a binary structure of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 (PDB

240

ID: 6W4H) shows a sugar moiety (β-D-fructopyranose) occupying the position of adenosine. In
SARS-CoV-1 nsp16 (PDB ID: 2XYR)14, a metal ion (Mg2+) is present in vicinity (~4 Å) of the
adenosine or β-D-fructopyranose ligands binding site (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, we propose
that this distant region endows nsp16 with the unique ability to bind small molecules outside of

the catalytic pocket. Future studies will clarify the impact of this binding region on nsp16 function
and viral pathogenesis.

Concluding Remarks

248

In conclusion, we have presented here a high-resolution structure of a ternary complex of
nsp16/nsp10 in the presence of an RNA cap and SAM, captured just prior to ribose 2’-O
methylation. The structure reveals key conformational changes in the RNA substrate binding site,
and additional biochemical determinants for the catalysis of RNA Cap methylation. Our structure

252

also reveals a potential allosteric site which may be targeted in the development of antiviral
therapies to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.

METHODS SUMMARY

256

The nsp16/nsp10 enzyme complex was expressed and purified from E. coli. The complex was
crystallized in the presence of an RNA cap analogue and S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and
adenosine. The crystals belong to the space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions of a=b=168 Å,
c=52.3Å, and a=b=90°, g=120. They diffract X-rays to 1.8 Å resolution with synchrotron radiation.

260

The structure was solved with molecular replacement using a binary complex (nsp16/nsp10/SAM;
PDB ID 3R24) as a template. The final model was refined to 1.8 Å resolution with Rfree and Rwork
values of ~ 19.1% and 17.2%, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).

METHODS
Protein expression and purification
The coding sequences of nsp16 (NCBI reference sequence YP_009725311.1) and nsp10 (NCBI

288

reference sequence: YP_0009725306.1) of the Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate
Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512) were cloned into a single pETduet-1 vector downstream to a 6XHis
tag sequence. This plasmid was transformed into an E. coli expression strain BL21 (DE3). The
transformed cells were grown in Terrific Broth medium supplemented with ampicillin at 37 °C.

292

Protein expression was induced by adding 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
at OD600 = 0.6 followed by continued incubation of the cultures for 14 hours at 18°C. Cells were
then harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 minutes. Thereafter, cells were re-suspended
in ice-cold lysis buffer. Cell lysis was accomplished using a microfluidizer (Analytik, UK). The

296

lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 minutes and passed through a 0.22µm filter. The
clarified soluble fraction was loaded on to a Nuvia IMAC column (Bio Rad) pre-equilibrated in
binding buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1mM TCEP, 10% Glycerol. The
proteins were eluted by increasing the concentration of imidazole. The 6XHis tag was then

300

proteolytically removed.

The tag-free sample was re-applied to the IMAC column to separate the un-cleaved protein
fraction. The proteins were purified by successive passage through HiTrap heparin and Superdex

304

75 columns (GE Healthcare). The nsp16/nsp10 complex was eluted as a single homogenous
species in a final buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1mM TCEP, 10%
glycerol and 5 mM MgSO4. The purified protein complex was concentrated to 5 mg/mL, mixed
with 5 molar excess of adenosine, and subjected to extensive crystallization trials.

Initial crystals were grown by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. After 3-4 rounds of
optimizations by varying pH, precipitant and salt concentrations, we grew larger crystals

312

amenable to synchrotron radiation. We soaked these crystals with

me7

GpppA RNA analogue

representative of Cap-0 structure. Diffraction-quality crystals were grown in a crystallization
solution containing 10% (v/v) MPD, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0. Before data collection, the co-crystals
were cryo-protected by serial soaks in solution containing original mother liquor and increasing

316

concentrations (0 à 20% v/v) of ethylene glycol, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination
Crystals of the nsp16/nsp10/SAM/Cap-O/adenosine complex diffracted X-rays to 1.8 Å and

320

belong to space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a=b=168Å, c = 52.3Å, c = 313.9Å, α = β =
90°, and γ = 120°, and with one nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer per asymmetric unit. All data were
indexed, integrated, and scaled using XDS24, aimless25, and various ccp4 suite programs
(truncate, freeflag, and mtz2various)26. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using

324

the SAM-bound nsp16/nsp10 (PDB ID: 3R24)8 structure as a template in Phaser 26. The resulting
maps indicated the electron densities for SAM, Cap-0 and adenosine, and regions in nsp16 with
extreme conformational changes (gate loops 1 and 2). Ligand restraints were generated using
Grade (Global Phasing Ltd.). We iteratively rebuilt and refined the model using the programs

328

Coot27 and REFMAC26. The final model was refined to Rfactor to ~ 17.1% and the Rfree to ~19%. A
Ramachandran plot for the final model shows 93.8% of the residues in the most preferred regions,
4.4% in the additionally allowed regions, and 1.7% in the disallowed regions. All figures that depict
structural models were generated using Pymol.

332
Determining affinities for nsp16/nsp10 ligands
The purified nsp16/nsp10 protein complex was labeled with a protein labeling Kit (Monolith, REDNHS 2nd Generation kit, Cat# MO-L011). In brief, 20 µM of protein was incubated with dye

336

solution (60 µM) in the labeling buffer and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room
temperature for 30 min. Each ligand was dissolved in the Microscale thermophoresis (MST)
reaction buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween
20. Two-fold serial dilutions started from 2 mM ligand concentrations were made in 12 steps. The

340

labeled protein at a final concentration of 20 nM was equally mixed into each ligand reaction
(ligand concentration range 500 nM to 1 mM). The final reaction mixtures were loaded into
premium capillary chips (Monolith Cat# MO-AK005) and measured on a Monolith NT.115
instrument (NanoTemper Technologies) at 20% excitation power and 40% MST power at 25 °C.

344

Results shown here are from two independent experiments. Data were fitted by a single-site
binding model in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Enzyme activity assay

348

To assess the relative activity of nsp16/nsp10 on RNA with an adenosine or guanosine as the
initiating nucleotide, increasing concentrations of purified nsp16/nsp10 were allowed to react with
1 µM me7GpppA- or me7GpppG-capped 25 nt RNA in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
5 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM SAM and 1 mM MgCl2. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for

352

30 min and stopped by heating at 75°C for 5 min. The reactions were subjected to LC/MS intact
mass analysis. Briefly, nucleic acids in the samples were separated using a Thermo DNAPac™
RP Column (2.1 × 50 mm, 4 µm) on a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC System, followed by mass
determination using a Thermo Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer. The raw data was

356

deconvoluted using Promass (Novatia Inc.). The ratio of the deconvoluted mass peak intensity of
the reactants and the expected products were used to estimate the percentage of 2’-O
methylation.
The two RNA substrates used in this assay only differ by 1 base (A vs G) at N1 base position:
