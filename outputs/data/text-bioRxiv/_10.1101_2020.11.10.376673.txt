Abstract

16

Olfactory dysfunction caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection represents as one of the most

17

predictive and common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. However, the causal link

18

between SARS-CoV-2 infection and olfactory disorders remains lacking. Herein we

19

demonstrate intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 induces robust viral replication in

20

the olfactory epithelium (OE), resulting in transient olfactory dysfunction in humanized

21

ACE2 mice. The sustentacular cells and Bowman's gland cells in OE were identified as

22

the major targets of SARS-CoV-2 before the invasion into olfactory sensory neurons.

23

Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers cell death and immune cell infiltration,

24

and impairs the uniformity of OE structure. Combined transcriptomic and proteomic

25

analyses reveal the induction of antiviral and inflammatory responses, as well as the

26

downregulation of olfactory receptors in OE from the infected animals. Overall, our

27

mouse model recapitulates the olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and

28

provides critical clues to understand the physiological basis for extrapulmonary

29

manifestations of COVID-19.

Introduction

36

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the newly identified severe acute

37

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused global crisis. The

38

clinical manifestations caused by SARS-CoV-2 predominantly involves the respiratory

39

system, including cough, sore throat, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress

40

syndrome (ARDS) (Huang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). With the wide spreading

41

of the disease, a significant portion of COVID-19 patients developed anosmia,

42

hyposmia or other olfactory dysfunctions according to clinical reports (Giacomelli et

43

al., 2020; Menni et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020). Accumulated evidence has

44

established the alteration of smell as one of the most predictive symptoms for COVID-

45

19 screening (Menni et al., 2020; Spinato et al., 2020).

46

The perception of smell begins with the odorant binding to the olfactory receptors (ORs)

47

of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) along the upper surface of olfactory epithelium

48

(OE). Each OSN projects an axon into the glomerulus of the olfactory bulb (OB) and

49

then synapses with the second order neuron to convey the odor information into the

50

olfactory cortex. Previously, upper respiratory tract infections have been considered as

51

a common cause of olfactory disorders. Mouse models have been used to reproduce the

52

olfactory infection and subsequent dysfunction (Kobayakawa et al., 2007; Papes et

53

al., 2018). For example, the post viral olfactory disorders was observed in Sendai virus

54

infected mice by buried food pellet test (BFPT), as well as the impairment of OE and

55

OB tissues (Matsunami et al., 2016). However, the animal model that can recapitulate

56

the olfactory dysfunctions seen in COVID-19 patients has not been established to date.

57

Human nasal respiratory epithelium (RE) cells possess an enriched expression of

58

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020),

59

the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020;

60

Zhou et al., 2020). Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses have characterized the

61

expression profile of ACE2 in the OE of mouse and human, mainly in non-

62

neuroepithelium cells (Brann et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020), and a recent study

63

based on hamster model has also observed plenty of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.10.376673; this version posted November 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this

64

OE section (Bryche et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020). Besides, vascular pericytes in OB

65

were validated to possess a high level expression of ACE2 in mouse model (Brann et

66

al., 2020), which play a key role on the maintenance of blood-brain barrier, as well as

67

the regulation of blood pressure and host immune response (Armulik et al., 2011).

68

Interestingly, some respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, respiratory syncytial

69

virus, are able to invade the OB and other parts of brain to establish infection (Dubé et

70

al., 2018; Netland et al., 2008). Thus, how SARS-CoV-2 invade the olfactory system

71

and contribute to the observed central nervous system (CNS) diseases remains to be

72

determined. In the present study, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection directly

73

cause transient olfactory dysfunction in an established mouse model, and characterized

74

the major target cells and pathological effects attributed to the olfactory dysfunction.

75
76

Results

77

SARS-CoV-2 targets OE and causes transient olfactory dysfunction in hACE2

78

mice.

79

We have previously established a humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mouse model susceptible

80

to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Sun et al., 2020). Herein, to determine the impact of SARS-

81

CoV-2 infection on olfactory system, groups of 6-8 weeks old hACE2 mice were

82

intranasally infected with 5.4 × 105 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2. Mice

83

inoculated with the same volume of culture media were set as mock infection controls.

84

At 2- and 4-days post infection (dpi), tissues from the respiratory tract and olfactory

85

system were collected from the necropsied mice, respectively, and subjected to

86

virological and immunological assays (Figure 1A). As expected, high levels of SARS-

87

CoV-2 RNAs were detected in the nasal respiratory epithelium (RE), trachea and lung

88

at 2 and 4 dpi, and peak viral RNA (2.36×1011 RNA copies/mouse) was detected in the

89

lung at 2 dpi (Figure S1A). Robust viral nucleocapsid (N) protein was detected in the

90

lung from SARS-CoV-2 infected hACE2 mice, but not from the control animals

91

(Figure S1B). Strikingly, high levels of viral RNAs (5.85×109 RNA copies/mouse)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.10.376673; this version posted November 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this

92

were also detected in the olfactory mucosa (OM) at 2 dpi and maintained at high level

93

(8.93×108 RNA copies/mouse) till 4 dpi (Figure 1B), while the viral RNA levels were

94

much lower in the OB and other parts of brain on 2 dpi and decreased to marginal level

95

on 4 dpi. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining assay detected a large amount of

96

SARS-CoV-2 N proteins in the OE along OM (Figure 1C), while no viral N protein

97

was detected in the OB and other parts of brain from SARS-CoV-2 infected hACE2

98

mice (Figure S1C). Additionally, in situ hybridization (ISH) by RNAscope

99

demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was predominantly detected in the OE (Figure

100

S1D), but no in the OB (Figure S1E).

101

To examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection directly impairs the olfactory function

102

of infected mice, a standard BFPT was conducted on 2 and 4 dpi, respectively.

103

Remarkably, a significantly increased latency (152.8 s v.s. 81.8 s; p=0.022) to locate

104

food pellets was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice as compared with the control

105

animals on 2 dpi (Figure 1D). Of particular note, 2 out of 13 infected mice developed

106

severe symptoms of anosmia as they failed to locate the food pellet within the

107

observation period. Interestingly, recovery from olfactory dysfunction of infected mice

108

was observed at 4 dpi, as the latency to locate food pellets was no difference from that

109

of the control animals (67.1 s v.s. 70.2 s; p=0.992). Thus, these results demonstrate that

110

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects OE and leads to olfactory dysfunction in mice.

111

SARS-CoV-2 primary targets non-neuroepithelial cells in the OE of hACE2 mice.

112

The OM consists of OE and the underlying lamina propria (LP). The OE is composed

113

of olfactory stem/progenitor cells including the horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and

114

globose basal cells (GBCs) residing in the basal region, the mature and immature OSNs,

115

and a variety of non-neuroepithelial lineage including the sustentacular cells,

116

microvillar cells and Bowman’s gland cells. The OSNs lining under the supporting cells

117

project numerous dendritic cilia with ORs into the nasal cavity and intermingle with

118

the microvilli of sustentacular cells and microvillar cells (Figure S2A). Due to the

119

asymmetrical expression pattern of ACE2 on the cell membrane as well as the unique

120

organization of OE, it is not easy to determine which cell compartments express ACE2.

121

To overcome this, we took advantage of the tdTomato cassette downstream of hACE2

122

transgene with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which allows the detection of

123

hACE2 expression by cytoplasmic fluorescence of tdTomato (Figure S2B). An

124

abundant expression of hACE2 along the apical surface of OE as well as within the

125

underlying LP was detected with a human ACE2-specific monoclonal antibody,

126

exhibiting a similar expression pattern of tdTomato (Figure S2C). A detailed

127

characterization of hACE2/tdTomato expressing cells in OM revealed that non-

128

neuroepithelial cells, including the sustentacular cells (CK8-postive, Figure S2D, d1),

129

the duct and acinus of Bowman's gland cells (Sox9/CK8-positive, Figure S2D, d2, d4)

130

in the OE and LP, respectively, and the microvillar cells (CD73/CK8-positive, Figure

131

S2E), are the primary cell types that harbor human ACE2 expression (Figure S2D),

132

whereas little hACE2/tdTomato expression was detected in the neuroepithelial lineage,

133

including HBCs (CK5-positive), GBCs (Sox2-positive at the basal region), immature

134

olfactory sensory neurons (iOSNs) (GAP43-positive) and mature olfactory sensory

135

neurons (mOSNs) (OMP-positive) (Figure S2D, d1-d4).

136

To further characterize the primary targets of SARS-CoV-2 in the OE, multiplex

137

immunostaining assays were performed with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and

138

specific cell markers. Remarkably, robust expression of SARS-CoV-2 viral N protein

139

was detected in the non-neuroepithelial lineage lining the outer surface of OE at 2 and

140

4 dpi (Figures 2A and 2C). The sustentacular cells (58.97%) and Bowman's gland cells

141

(22.76%) represent as the major target cell types at 2 dpi, while some microvillar cells

142

(6.93%) and HBCs (4.11%) were also infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 2A and 2B).

143

Additionally, a small population of iOSNs (1.28%) were also infected by SARS-CoV-

144

2, while none mOSN was infected at 2 dpi (Figures 2A and 2B). Interestingly, SARS-

145

CoV-2-positive HBCs and iOSNs were found adjacent to infected sustentacular cells

146

(Fig. 2a). Additionally, substantial viral protein was detected within the cilia, the

147

cellular bodies and the underlying nerve bundles of mOSNs at 4 dpi (Figure 2C, c1-

148

c2). These results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the non-neuroepithelial

149

cells lining the outer surface of OE, and subsequently invades the neuroepithelial

150

lineage in hACE2 mice.

151

SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers apoptosis and immune cell infiltration in OE.

152

We then characterized the histopathological changes of OE in response to SARS-CoV-

153

2 infection. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection directly impaired the structural

154

uniformity of OE, as characterized by clusters of remnants on the surface of OE (Figure

155

3A), as well as disorganized arrangement of supporting cells (Figure 3B) and olfactory

156

neurons (Figure 3C). The integrity of the cilia layer of mOSNs and the microvilli of

157

supporting cells were severely damaged (Figures 3B and 3C). More importantly,

158

compared with mock treated groups, profound cell apoptosis (cleaved-caspase3-

159

positive) was observed in both of the OE and LP section of OM from the SARS-CoV-

160

2 infected mice (Figure 3D). Immunofluorescence co-staining indicated the apoptosis

161

can be seen in sustentacular cells, HBCs as well as the cellular bodies and the

162

underlying nerve bundles of iOSNs and mOSNs (Figure 3D). Additionally, the

163

infiltrations of immune cells, including the macrophages (CD68-positive), the dendritic

164

cells (CD103-positive) and the neutrophils (Ly-6G-positive) were evident in the

165

infected OE (Figure 3E). The profound invasion of CD8 T lymphocytes with high

166

expression of cytotoxic enzymes Perforin and Granzyme B would further deteriorate

167

the cellularity of olfactory epithelial cells (Figure 3F). These observed physiological

168

damages upon to SARS-CoV-2 infection probably contribute to the functional loss of

169

olfaction.

170

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces regeneration of OE.

171

Without infection, HBCs at the basal region of OE remains quiescent as indicated by

172

little expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 within CK5-positive cells (Figure 4A,

173

a1). SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased the number of CK5/Sox2/Ki67

174

triple-positive cells, strongly suggesting a transition from HBCs to actively cycling

175

GBCs (Figure 4A, a2). Of particular note, a prominent upward growth of HBCs from

176

the basal layer into the upper section of OE was observed in infected animals, which

177

also co-express the markers of their lineage offspring such as iOSNs (Figure 4B, b1),

178

sustentacular cells (Figure 4B, b2) and the microvillar cells (Figure 4B, b3). These

179

results suggest that the impaired OE is regenerated through olfactory stem cell-based

180

proliferation and differentiation into olfactory neurons and supporting lineage, thereby

181

restoring the normal function of OE.

182

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces inflammatory response and suppresses olfactory

183

signaling pathway in OE.

184

To decipher the underlying mechanism of the observed olfactory dysfunction in SARS-

185

CoV-2 infected mice at the molecular level, combined transcriptomic and quantitative

186

proteomic analyses of the OE and OB samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice were

187

performed in comparison with that from the control animals. In the OE samples, a total

188

of 939 genes and 507 proteins were regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 40 of

189

them were synchronously regulated at both mRNA and protein levels (Figures S3A

190

and S3B). While in the OB samples, 286 genes and 251 proteins were up/down

191

regulated, and only 4 of them were consistently regulated at mRNA and protein levels

192

(Figures S3A and S3C). These results further support that OE represents the major site

193

for SARS-CoV-2 replication. Gene enrichment analyses showed that SARS-CoV-2

194

infection induces strong antiviral defense and inflammatory response in OE at both

195

mRNA and protein levels at 2 dpi, which faded at 4 dpi (Figures 5A, S4A and S4C).

196

Moreover, genes related to “positive regulation of cell death” and “regulation of neuron

197

projection development” were also up regulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures

198

5A, S4B and S4D), which was consistent with the immunostaining results (Figure 3D

199

and 4A). Further integrated omics analysis of the OE samples showed that a total of 30

200

genes were up regulated at both mRNA and protein levels. Of which, antiviral

201

genes/proteins including Isg15, Stat1, Stat2, Oasl2, Ifit2, Ifit3, etc, were found to

202

interact closely. Other genes/proteins involved in neurotransmitter transport including

203

Erc2, Lin7a, Slc1a3 and Slc25a18, were also observed (Figure 5B). While in the OB

204

samples, we did not find any induction of antiviral response related genes, but

205

downregulation of inflammatory response related genes was observed (Figures S5A

206

and S5B).

207

Of particular note, KEGG pathway enrichment of down regulated transcripts and

208

proteins in OE showed that genes belonging to “olfactory transduction” were

209

significantly enriched (Figure 5C). Among all 100 down regulated transcripts at 2 dpi,

210

36 were ORs (Figures 5D and S3B), while among 278 down regulated transcripts at 4

211

dpi, 97 were ORs (Figures S3B and S4E). Further RT-qPCR assay showed a dozen of

212

OR genes were significantly down regulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection

213

(Figure 5E), which may also attribute to the observed olfactory dysfunction.

214
215

Discussion

216

In the present study, we used an established mouse model to demonstrate that SARS-

217

CoV-2 infection can cause olfactory dysfunction and anosmia, and these experimental

218

evidence support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection as the cause of olfactory

219

dysfunction and anosmia in COVID-19 patients (Iravani et al., 2020; Moein et al.,

220

2020). The SARS-CoV-2 infected mice exhibited damaged OE, immune cell

221

infiltration, down regulated OR expressions and impaired olfactory function, largely

222

mimicking the olfactory abnormalities of COVID-19 patients. Robust viral replication

223

and direct antiviral responses were detected in the OE of the infected mice, but not in

224

OB and other parts of the brain, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be

225

restricted in OM, instead of spreading to the CNS. A recent study also supports this

226

point of view, for that SARS-CoV-2 protein can be detected in OE, but not in OB, in a

227

hamster model (Bryche et al., 2020). One possible explanation for the absence of

228

SARS-CoV-2 in CNS is the IFN-dependent antiviral mechanism, which is an effective

229

barrier to limit the virus from invading into CNS (Forrester et al., 2018). In addition,

230

the apoptosis of infected OSNs may contribute to the prevention of virus spreading into

231

CNS after the rapid infection and destruction of OE (Mori et al., 2002).

232

Our results show that SARS-CoV-2 initially infects non-neuroepithelial cells, including

233

sustentacular cells, Bowman’s gland cells and microvillar cells, which are involved in

234

OSN support, host immune response, electrolyte balance maintenance, and mucus

235

secretion (Cooper et al., 2020). Meanwhile, we observed various levels of damage in

236

OE after SARS-CoV-2 infection, including cilia desquamating, loss of surface

237

microvilli and substantial structural disorganization. In addition, our results showed a

238

certain degree of cell apoptosis and inflammatory infiltration at both cell and molecular

239

level following SARS-CoV-2 infection. All these data indicate that the damaged

240

supporting non-neuroepithelial cells and inflammatory infiltration caused by SARS-

241

CoV-2 infection contribute to the detrimental effects of the virus on olfactory function.

242

Our results are supported by recent findings in mouse and human, showing that the non-

243

neuroepithelial cells of OE express high levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at both mRNA

244

and protein levels (Brann et al., 2020; Torabi et al., 2020), (Trotier et al., 2007).

245

Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 positive signals were also observed in mOSNs and HBCs

246

of infected animals, although we didn’t detect any hACE2 expression in these cells.

247

The underlying mechanism remains elusive and a hACE2-independent spread of

248

SARS-CoV-2 infection may be considered.

249

We observed many ORs were significantly down regulated at 2 and 4 dpi, suggesting

250

the declined olfaction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent study also showed that

251

induction of anti-viral type I interferon signaling in the mouse OE was associated with

252

diminished odor discrimination and decreased RNA levels of ORs (Rodriguez et al.,

253

2020). These findings may support what we observed here that SARS-CoV-2 infection

254

causes significant interferon response and dramatic OR decrease simultaneously in OE.

255

We also observed three odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) significantly decreased at

256

protein level with the infection of OE, which are compact globular water-soluble

257

proteins with ligand-binding capabilities and thought to aid in capture and transport of

258

odorants to the ORs (Matarazzo et al., 2002; Pes and Pelosi, 1995; Sun et al., 2018).

259

Besides, although no virus infection was observed in OB, we detected some up/down

260

regulated transcripts or proteins by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. It worth

261

noting that among all 4 proteins co-regulated at both transcriptomic and proteomic

262

levels, Rtp1 (Receptor-transporting protein 1) was down regulated at both levels (Table

263

S1). This protein specifically promotes functional cell surface expression of ORs (Wu

264

et al., 2012), suggesting that the inhibition of Rtp1 in OB may lead to down regulation

265

of ORs. Therefore, the damage of OE which is closely related to olfactory dysfunction

266

are caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuroepithelial cells and OSNs synergizes

267

with the host antiviral immune responses.

268

According to our results, the olfactory dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected animals is

269

recoverable as almost all animals recovered to normal sense of smell at 4 dpi.

270

Additionally, studies focusing on COVID-19 patients with anosmia has shown that

271

most of them would recovery from loss of smell within a few weeks or less (Hopkins

272

et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020), indicating a potential mechanism of OE regeneration

273

from injuries. The OE undergoes a lifelong regeneration and replacement depending on

274

two populations of basal stem cells, HBCs and GBCs. HBCs are mitotically quiescent

275

under the normal conditions and convert to be activated and differentiate into other

276

kinds of cells once the damage of OE occurs (Salazar et al., 2019). Unlike HBCs, most

277

of GBCs are mitotically activated and responsible for the regeneration of both neuronal

278

and non-neuronal cells (Gadye et al., 2017; Leung et al., 2007; Yu and Wu, 2017).

279

Indeed, we observed the regeneration of OE by the significant proliferation and

280

morphological change of HBCs, accompanied by the differentiation of stem cells into

281

iOSNs, sustentacular cells as well as microvillar cells. In this way, the structural basis

282

and function of OE as well as the olfactory function can be restored to normal in SARS-

283

CoV-2 infected animals. Furthermore, it was indicated that the damage and apoptosis

284

of OSNs are closely involved in their regeneration (Ishimura et al., 2008), and the

285

occurrence of inflammatory response also facilitates the stem cell differentiation and

286

OE regeneration (Chen et al., 2019; Lane et al., 2014). At transcriptomic and

287

proteomic level, we observed up regulated “regulation of neuron projection

288

development” genes/proteins on 2 and 4 dpi, implying the progression of a neuron

289

projection over time from its formation to the mature structure. Interestingly, although

290

there were many significantly down regulated ORs on 4 dpi, the mRNA levels of many

291

ORs rose back slightly compared with that of 2 dpi, indicating the OR expression tends

292

to recover to normal.

293

In summary, our study established a mouse model of olfactory dysfunction induced by

294

SARS-CoV-2. Considering the interspecies discrepancy of olfactory construction

295

between rodent and human, e.g., the relative size of the OB to the brain, the proportion

296

of the brain involved in olfaction and the expression of ORs (Salazar et al., 2019),

297

further studies are recommended to reproduce the SARS-CoV-2 caused olfactory

298

dysfunction in other animal models, especially the non-human primates. Also, to

299

validate the targets and biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human

300

specimens is still ponderable. The animal model of olfactory disorders is available to

301

subsequently evaluate the antiviral drugs as well as vaccines for the inhibition of SARS-

302

CoV-2 and the improvement of post viral olfactory disorders.

Cell and Virus
The Vero cells were maintained at 37℃ under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco), 10 mM HEPES and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The SARS-CoV2 strain BetaCoV/Beijing/IMEBJ05/2020 (Nos. GWHACBB01000000) was originally
isolated from a COVID-19 patient. For virus propagation, Vero cells were incubated
with SARS-CoV-2 and the culture supernatants were collected at 3 dpi. The stock of
SARS-CoV-2 was serially diluted and titered on monolayers of Vero cells. Studies with
infectious SARS-CoV-2 were conducted under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities at the
Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, AMMS.

SARS-CoV-2 infection of hACE2 mice
The animal operation procedure was reviewed and approved by the Laboratory Animal
Center, AMMS (approval number: IACUC-DWZX-2020-001). For intranasal infection,
5.4 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 was instilled into the nasal cavity of 6-8 weeks old
hACE2 mice anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 50 mg/kg by
intraperitoneal route. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized at 2 or 4 dpi to isolate
tissues.

RNA Extraction and real-time quantitative PCR
Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, hACE2 and OR mRNA transcript levels were
performed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Total RNAs were isolated using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured with the primer-probe set: CoV-F3 (5’TCCTGGTGATTCTTCTTCAGGT-3’),
CoV-R3
(5’-TCTGAGAGAGGGTC
AAGTGC-3’) and CoV-P3 (5’-AGCTGCAGCACCAGCTGTCCA-3’). The relative
expression of hACE2 mRNA was measured with the primer set: ehACE2 F1 (5’CGAAGCCGAAGACCTGTTCTA-3’) and ehACE2 R1 (5’-GGGCAAGTGTGG
ACTGTTCC-3’). The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) served as the endogenous control, and the following primer set was used: 5′CCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA-3′
and
5′-CCAGAGGCGTACAGGGATAG-3′.
Amplification was performed using a One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio,
Otsu, Japan), and the following real-time PCR conditions were applied: 42 ℃ for 5 min
and 95 ℃ for 10 s followed by 40 cycles of 95℃ for 5 s and 60 ℃ for 20 s on an
LightCycler® 480 Instrument (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The
absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels was performed by comparison to
a standard curve and shown as SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per mouse. The relative
expression of hACE2 and OR mRNA levels was calculated according to the 2−ΔΔCt
method. Each sample was assayed with three repeats.

The buried food pellet test (BFPT)
The standard BFPT was used to evaluate the olfactory function of SARS-CoV-2infected mice and DMEM-treated mice as previously described (Lehmkuhl et al., 2014;
Yang and Crawley, 2009). Mice were food-restricted to 0.2 g chow per day for 2 days

before test and during the experimental period to ensure motivation. The food pellet
was buried 1 centimeter below the surface of 3-centermeter-high bedding in a clear test
cage (45 cm L× 24 cm W × 20 cm H). One mouse was placed in the center of the cage,
and the latency for the mouse to uncover the pellet was recorded. The latency was
defined as 300 seconds for the mouse which cannot find the pellet within 5 minutes.

RNAscope in situ hybridization
RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed with the
RNAscope assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the tissues were isolated immediately after
euthanasia and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 hours, and embedded in
paraffin after being decalcified using the 10% EDTA solution, 4-μm-thick formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) slides were warmed at 60 ℃ for 1 h before they
deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in a series of graded alcohols and pretreated with
RNAscope target retrieval at 95 ℃. Slides were detected in situ using 2.5 HD Reagent
Kit (BROWN) (Cat: 322310) and sense probe from the RNAscope ISH probe-VnCoV2019-S (Cat: 848561) at 40 ℃ in HybEZ hybridization oven and then
counterstained with hematoxylin.

Multiplex immunofluorescent staining
The 4-μm-thick paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a
series of graded alcohols. Antigen retrievals were performed in citrate buffer (pH=6)
with a microwave (Sharp, R-331ZX) for 20 min at 95°C followed by a 20 min cool
down at room temperature. Multiplex fluorescence labeling was performed using TSAdendron-fluorophores (NEON 9-color All round Discovery Kit for FFPE, Histova
Biotechnology, NEFP950). Briefly, endogenous peroxidase was quenched in 3% H2O2
for 20 min, followed by blocking reagent for 30 min at room temperature. Primary
antibody was incubated for 2-4 h in a humidified chamber at 37°C, followed by
detection using the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and TSA-dendronfluorophores. Afterwards, the primary and secondary antibodies were thoroughly
eliminated by heating the slides in retrieval/elution buffer (Abcracker®, Histova
Biotechnology, ABCFR5L) for 10 s at 95°C using microwave. In a serial fashion, each
antigen was labeled by distinct fluorophores. Multiplex antibody panels applied in this
study were: hACE2 (Abcam, ab108209, 1:200); tdTomato (Rockland, 600-401-379,
1:500); SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Sinobiological, 40143-R004, 1:1000);

(H&E) staining according to standard procedures. Briefly, after being rehydrated in
series of graded alcohols, the 4-μm-thick slides of mouse OE were stained with

hACE2 transgenic mice before or after SARS-CoV-2 infection (2 or 4 dpi) as previously
described were used for RNA-Seq. Total RNA from OE and OB were extracted using
TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and DNase I (NEB, USA) treated, respectively.
Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit
for Illumina® (#E7530L, NEB, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommendations
and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. The clustering of
the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot cluster generation system using
HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4-cBot-HS (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. After cluster generation, the libraries were sequenced
on Illumina Novaseq6000 platform and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. After
sequencing, perl script was used to filter the original data (Raw Data) to clean reads by
removing contaminated reads for adapters and low-quality reads. Clean reads were
aligned to the mouse genome (Mus_musculus.GRCm38.99) using Hisat2 v2.1.0. The
number of reads mapped to each gene in each sample was counted by HTSeq v0.6.0
and TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads) was then
calculated to estimate the expression level of genes in each sample.

The OE and OB tissues were disrupted by a Grinding Mill for six cycles of 5 s each
with lysis buffer [9 M Urea, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mM NaCl, 10 mM
iodoacetamide (IAA), 5 mM Na4P2O7, 100 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0), 1 mM NaF, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 1 mM sodium glycerophophate, 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma,
St. Louis, USA), 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma, St. Louis, USA), and 1
tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for every
10 mL of lysis buffer] and 2 mm steel balls, respectively. The supernatants were
obtained after centrifuging at 8,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The protein lysates were
inactivated at 56 ℃ for 30 min then stored at -80°C before further processing. Protein
concentration was measured by a short Coomassie blue stained 10% SDS-PAGE as
described (Xu et al., 2009). The same amount of protein (130 μg) from each sample
was reduced with 5 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 20 mM of IAA,
precleaned with 10% SDS-PAGE (10%, 0.7 cm), and digested in-gel with a final
concentration of 12.5 ng/μL for Ac-trypsin combined with endoproteinase lys-C
provided by Enzyme & Spectrum (Beijing, China) with a ratio of 2:1 at 37°C for 12-14
h (Zhao et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015). The extracted peptides from OE and OB
groups were labeled with TMT10 reagents according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA), respectively. Ten labeled channels were then
quenched with 5% hydroxylamine and combined according to normalization value by
the ratio checking. The mixed samples were vacuum dried.

The dried TMT labeled mixture were resuspended in 100 μL of buffer A [2%
acetonitrile (ACN), pH10) and separated by a high pH reverse phase HPLC system
(Rigol, L-3120, Beijing, China). The combined samples were injected into a Durashell
C18 column (150 Å, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm2) and eluted with a linear gradient in 60 min.
Briefly, the solvent gradients of buffer B (2% dd H2O and 98% ACN) were as follows:
0% for 5 min, 0-3% for 3 min, 3-22% for 37 min, 22-32% for 10 min, 32-90% for 1
min, 90% for 2 min, and 100% for 2 min. The LC flow rate was set at 0.7 mL/min and
monitored at 214 nm. The column oven was set at 45 °C. Total 60 fractions were
collected and then combined into 15 fractions before vacuum drying according to the
peak abundance. The combined samples were dissolved in loading buffer [1% ACN and
1% formic acid (FA)] and analyzed using an EASY-nLC 1200 ultra-performance liquid
chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with
a self-packed capillary column (75 μm i.d. × 15 cm, 3 μm C18 reverse-phase fusedsilica), with a 78 min nonlinear gradient at a flow rate of 600 nL/min. The gradient was
comprised of an increase from 6% to 15% solvent B (0.1% FA in 80% ACN) for 15
min, 15% to 30% in 40 min, 30% to 40% in 15 min, 40% to 100% in 1 min, and finally
holding at 100% for the last 7 min. The eluted peptides were analyzed on Orbitrap
Fusion Lumos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). MS1 data were collected
in the Orbitrap using a 120 k resolution over an m/z range of 300-1500 setting the
maximum injection time (MIT) to 50 ms. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set to
4×105, determined charge states between 2 and 7 were subjected to fragmentation via
higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with 37% collision energy and a
12 s dynamic exclusion window was used with isotopes excluded. For the MS/MS scans,
the fractions were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 50 k. For each scan, the
isolation width was 1.6 m/z, the AGC was 5 × 104, and the MIT was 86 ms.

DESeq2 v1.6.3 was used for differential gene expression analysis. Genes with
padj≤0.05 and |Log2FC| > 1 were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
The total proteome quantification datasets were median-normalized, and pValue was
calculated by Perseus (1.6.6.0). Proteins ratios between control and infection ≥1.5-fold
and pValue ≤ 0.05 were considered as regulated differentially expressed proteins

(Gene ontology BP) using Metascape (Zhou et al., 2019). KEGG pathway enrichment
and protein interaction network were analyzed using STRING (Szklarczyk et al.,
2019). Heatmaps of gene expression levels were constructed using pheatmap package
in R (https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html). Dot plots and
volcano plots were constructed using ggplot2 (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the OE and causes olfactory dysfunction
in hACE2 mice.
(A) Schematic diagram of experimental design. Briefly, groups of 6-8 weeks old
hACE2 mice were infected with 5.4 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally. Olfactory
function of infected mice was measured by the buried food pellet test at indicated times
post inoculation. Mice were sacrificed at 2 dpi and 4 dpi for viral detection and
histopathological analysis.
(B) Schematic view of the OM in the nasal cavity of mice in a sagittal plane, the dotted
line indicated a coronal section (upper). And viral RNA copies were determined by realtime qPCR and shown as mean ± SD from three independent replicates (lower).
(C) Immunostaining of OM from SARS-CoV-2 infected mice for SARS-CoV-2 N
protein (red) and DAPI (blue). Scale bar, 400 μm.
(D) Buried food pellet test. Latency to locate the food pellets for mice infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (n=13) or DMEM (n=11) was measured at 2 dpi and 4 dpi.
