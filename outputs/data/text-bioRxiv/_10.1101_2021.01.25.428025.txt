ubiquitin ligases that, among other functions, downregulate cell-surface proteins involved in

glycoproteins (Env) and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G). However, the

29

mechanism of antiviral activity remains poorly defined. Here we show that MARCH8 antagonizes

30

the full-length forms of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, Ebola virus glycoprotein (EboV-GP), and the spike

31

(S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) thereby impairing

32

the infectivity of virions pseudotyped with these viral glycoproteins. This MARCH8-mediated

33

targeting of viral glycoproteins requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING-CH domain.

34

We observe that MARCH8 protein antagonism of VSV-G is CT dependent. In contrast, MARCH8-

35

mediated targeting of HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S protein by MARCH8 does not

36

require the CT, suggesting a novel mechanism of MARCH-mediated antagonism of these viral

37

glycoproteins. Confocal microscopy data demonstrate that MARCH8 traps the viral glycoproteins

38

in an intracellular compartment. We observe that the endogenous expression of MARCH8 in

39

several relevant human cell types is rapidly inducible by type I interferon. These results help to

40

inform the mechanism by which MARCH proteins exert their antiviral activity and provide

41

insights into the role of cellular inhibitory factors in antagonizing the biogenesis, trafficking, and

virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins.

Viral envelope glycoproteins are an important structural component on the surface of enveloped

INTRODUCTION

57

capacity. In turn, cells have evolved extensive and elaborate defense mechanisms to impede virus

58

replication. Cells encode numerous proteins, often referred to as inhibitory or restriction factors,

59

that are central components of the innate immune response that serves as the first line of defense

60

against invading pathogens.

61

mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family proteins, tripartite motif protein 5 ,

62

(TRIM5), SAM and HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1), Myxovirus resistance

63

2 (Mx2), and tetherin/BST-2 (1). These restriction factors are either expressed constitutively

64

and/or are induced by IFN (2-4). Recently, an emerging class of host proteins have been shown to

65

specifically target the synthesis, trafficking and/or function(s) of viral glycoproteins (5). These

66

include the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins, guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs),

67

endoplasmic reticulum class I -mannosidase (ERManI), galectin 3 binding protein

68

(LGALS3BP/90K), Ser incorporator (SERINC), and the MARCH proteins (5-13).

Viruses rely heavily on host cellular machinery to replicate due to their relatively limited coding

Well-characterized restriction factors include apolipoprotein B

69

Viral envelope glycoproteins, which are important structural components decorating the

70

surface of enveloped virus particles, recognize receptors on target cells and mediate viral entry by

71

catalyzing membrane fusion events either at the plasma membrane or in low-pH endosomes

72

following endocytic uptake of the viral particle. They are synthesized and cotranslationally

73

glycosylated in the ER and then traffic through the secretory pathway to the site of virus assembly

74

(14). During trafficking through the Golgi apparatus, some viral glycoproteins are cleaved by furin

75

or furin-like proteases as a requisite step in the generation of the fusion-active viral glycoprotein

76

complex. Viral glycoproteins often multimerize (e.g., as trimers) during trafficking (14). Many

77

enveloped viruses assemble at the plasma membrane, whereas some assemble in alternative

78

compartments. For example, SARS-CoV-2 particles are thought to assemble in the ER/Golgi

79

intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and be released by exploiting lysosomal organelles (15, 16).

80

Ubiquitin is a small, 76-amino acid protein that is highly expressed in eukaryotic cells. It

81

can be attached to target proteins, usually on Lys residues, but occasionally on Ser, Thr, or Cys

82

residues, via a multi-enzyme cascade involving an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2

83

ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and an E3 ubiquitin ligase (17). Ubiquitin attachment can serve

84

as a signal for target protein degradation in the proteasome or lysosome, or can regulate the

85

endocytic trafficking of the target protein or other aspects of protein function.

86

The MARCH family of RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligases comprise 11 structurally diverse

87

members. With the exception of the cytosolic MARCH7 and MARCH10 proteins, MARCH

88

family members are transmembrane proteins containing multiple (ranging from 2-14) putative

89

membrane-spanning domains and bearing an N-terminal cytoplasmic RING-CH domain (Fig. 1)

90

(18). MARCH proteins were originally discovered as cellular homologs of the K3 and K5 E3

91

ubiquitin ligases of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) (19, 20). These viral

92

MARCH protein homologs confer escape from the host immune response by downregulating the

93

major histocompatibility class I (MHC-I) antigen on the surface of virus-infected cells (21, 22).

94

Other large DNA viruses encode analogous proteins involved in immune evasion (23). Cellular

95

MARCH proteins have been reported to downregulate numerous proteins, including MHC-II (24),

96

transferrin receptor (25), TRAIL receptors (26), CD44 and CD81 (27), IL-1 receptor accessory

97

protein (28), CD98 (29), and tetherin/BST-2 (30). The RING-CH domain of MARCH proteins

98

and its interaction with E2 enzymes are responsible for their E3 ligase activity; thus, mutations

99

that either inactivate the catalytic center of the RING domain, or prevent interaction with E2s,

100

abrogate MARCH protein activity (18, 25, 28). MARCH proteins and their viral homologs

101

generally catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin to Lys residues in the CTs of their target proteins,

102

leading to their degradation and/or altered trafficking (18, 19, 25, 31-34). However, the viral

103

MARCH protein homologs K3 and K5 of KSHV have been reported to attach ubiquitin to Ser,

104

Thr, and/or Cys residues (35-37).

105

MARCH8 was first identified in a genome-wide siRNA screen as a potential HIV-1

106

restriction factor acting early in the virus replication cycle by an unknown mechanism (38). More

107

recently, three MARCH proteins – MARCH1, 2 and 8 – were reported to be late-acting restriction

108

factors that target retroviral Env glycoproteins and VSV-G, thereby impairing infectivity of HIV-

109

1 virions bearing these viral glycoproteins (6, 8, 11). The endogenous expression of MARCH

110

proteins differs among cell types, with higher expression of MARCH1, 2 and 8 observed in

111

myeloid cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and monocyte-derived dendritic

112

cells (MDDCs) compared to primary CD4+ T cells (6, 11). MARCH8 expression has been reported

113

to be particularly high in the lung (19). MARCH8 knockdown or knockout in myeloid cells

114

increases HIV-1 infectivity, suggesting that MARCH8 may serve as an antiviral factor in these

115

cell types (11). MARCH1, 2, and 8 are reported to be localized to lysosomes, endosomes and the

116

plasma membrane (18, 19, 25).

117

To understand the mechanism of MARCH-mediated antiviral activity in greater detail,

118

envelope glycoproteins from four families of viruses were selected for study: the retrovirus HIV-

119

1, the rhabdovirus VSV, the filovirus Ebola virus (EboV) and the coronavirus severe acute

120

respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Three of the glycoproteins encoded by these

121

viruses [HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP, and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein] are cleaved by furin, whereas

122

VSV-G is not (39-41) (Fig.1). HIV-1 Env is synthesized as a precursor, gp160, that is cleaved to

123

gp120 and gp41; the EboV-GP precursor pre-GP is cleaved to GP1 and GP2, and the SARS-CoV-

124

2 S protein precursor is cleaved to S1 and S2 [Fig.1; (39-41)]. The CTs of the viral glycoproteins

125

investigated in this study are highly variable in length, with those of HIV-1 Env, SARS-CoV-2 S

126

protein, VSV-G, and EboV-GP containing 150, 39, 21 and 4 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1).

127

These viral glycoproteins have CTs that vary not only in length but also in the number of Lys

128

residues they contain, with two Lys residues in the CT of HIV-1 Env, four in the SARS-CoV-2 S

129

protein, five in VSV-G, and one in the CT of EboV-GP (Fig. 1). These Lys residues could

130

potentially serve as targets for MARCH-mediated ubiquitination. Our data demonstrate that each

131

of the viral glycoproteins examined is antagonized, to variable extents, by MARCH8. We

132

observed that MARCH-mediated inhibition of VSV-G is CT dependent, whereas inhibition of

133

HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S protein is CT independent. We further demonstrate

134

that knock-down of endogenous MARCH8 gene expression in HEK293T cells increases the

135

infectivty of HIV-1 particles produced from those cells and that endogenous expression of

136

MARCH8 is induced by IFN treatment in a human T-cell line, hPBMCs, and primary human

137

airway epithelial cells. Finally, we show that MARCH proteins colocalize with, and retain, the

138

viral glycoproteins in an aberrant intracellular compartment that bears the lysosomal marker

139

LAMP-1. Collectively, our data provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of the

140

MARCH family of cellular E3 ubiquitin ligases and their ability to antagonize diverse viral

141

envelope glycoproteins.

dependence. It has been shown that the ectopic expression of MARCH8 in virus-producer cells

149

markedly reduces the infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing retroviral Env glycoproteins or VSV-G

150

(6, 11). However, the molecular mechanism by which MARCH8 targets viral glycoproteins is not

151

well defined. As mentioned in the Introduction, it has been determined that MARCH proteins

152

downregulate a number of proteins by transferring ubiquitin to their CTs, leading to their

153

lysosomal degradation. To investigate the potential role of MARCH-mediated CT ubiquitination

154

in the downregulation of viral glycoproteins, we deleted the CTs of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, EboV-

155

GP, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 1) and cotransfected the viral glycoprotein expression

156

vectors with the Env(-) pNL4-3 derivative pNL4-3/KFS (42) or a luciferase-encoding NL4-3-

157

derived vector virus. In the case of HIV-1, we used full-length pNL4-3 expressing WT Env or the

158

CT-truncated Env mutant, CTdel-144 (43).

159

normalized for p24 capsid content or reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, and used to infect the

160

TZM-bl indicator cell line (44) or, in the case of the S protein pseudotypes, HEK293T cells stably

161

expressing the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. Consistent with

162

previous reports (6, 11), we observed that the infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing VSV-G was

163

markedly reduced (by ~10-fold) upon expression of WT MARCH8 in the virus-producer cells

164

(Fig. 2A). In contrast, the MARCH8-CS (25) and MARCH8-W114A (28, 45, 46) mutants, which

165

abolish RING-CH function or interaction with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, respectively, did

166

not exert antiviral activity (Fig. 2A). We observed that the infectivity conferred by VSV-G Tailless

167

was ~40% that of WT VSV-G, and overexpression of MARCH8 in virus-producer cells had no

168

significant effect on the infectivity of this VSV-G variant (Fig. 2A). Next, we investigated the

169

ability of MARCH8 to inhibit a VSV-G mutant in which the Lys residues in the CT, which are

170

potential sites of MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination, were substituted. A VSV-G mutant in which

171

the five Lys residues in the CT were mutated to Ala displayed severely compromised infectivity

172

(data not shown). We therefore introduced the more conservative Lys-to-Arg substitution (K-to-

173

R) at these five Lys residues (Fig. 1) and observed that this mutant is fully infectious relative to

174

the WT. As observed with the VSV-G Tailless mutant, overexpression of MARCH8 in virus-

175

producer cells had no significant effect on the infectivity of the VSV-G K-to-R mutant. As

176

expected, the MARCH8 mutants likewise did not diminish the infectivity of either the Tailless or

177

K-to-R VSV-G mutants. These results indicate that the ability of MARCH8 to antagonize VSV-G

178

in this experimental system is dependent upon the Lys residues in the VSV-G CT, likely because

179

they are targets of MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination.

180

As reported previously (6, 11), we observed that the infectivity of virus particles bearing

181

HIV-1 Env is severely reduced (by ~10-fold) upon overexpression of WT MARCH8 in the virus-

182

producer cell. This inhibitory activity was to a large extent eliminated by the MARCH8-CS and

183

MARCH8-W114A mutations (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether the inhibition of HIV-1 Env is CT

184

dependent we tested the CTdel144 Env mutant (43), which lacks nearly the entire gp41 CT (Fig.

185

1). Under these assay conditions, the infectivity of CTdel144 HIV-1 was ~40% that of WT HIV-

186

1. Interestingly, in contrast to the lack of MARCH8-mediated inhibition observed with Tailless

187

VSV-G, the infectivity of CT-deleted HIV-1 was reduced to a similar extent as the WT by

188

expression of MARCH8 in the virus-producer cells. The MARCH8 mutants did not significantly

189

inhibit the infectivity of the CTdel144 HIV-1 Env mutant. These results demonstrate that

190

MARCH8-mediated antagonism of HIV-1 Env requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the

191

RING domain but does not require the gp41 CT.

192

As indicated above, the dependency on the CT for MARCH8-mediated inhibition differs

193

between VSV-G and HIV-1 Env. We next examined the effect of MARCH8 on the infectivity of

194

the EboV-GP, which contains a CT of only four amino acids (Fig. 1). For these experiments, we

195

used a version of the EboV-GP lacking the mucin-like domain (47) as we obtained higher

196

infectivity with this variant (data not shown). We will refer to this delta mucin-like domain variant

197

(MLD) as WT because it contains an intact CT. The infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing either

198

the WT or CT-deleted EboV-GP was reduced by ~30-40 % when the virus was produced in the

199

presence of MARCH8. We also mutated the single Lys residue in the CT of EboV-GP and

200

observed that the infectivity of this K-to-A mutant was inhibited by ~50% in the presence of

201

MARCH8. The infectivity of EboV-GP mutants was similar to that of the WT in the absence of

202

MARCH8 overexpression (Fig. 2C). No statistically significant reduction in infectivity was

203

observed for WT EboV-GP upon expression of the MARCH8-CS mutant, yet a minor reduction

204

in infectivity was observed for EboV-GP Tailless and K-To-A mutants in the presence of the

205

MARCH8-W114A mutant (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that MARCH8-mediated

206

antagonism of EboV-GP is dependent on the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING domain but

207

does not require the short EboV-GP CT.

208

We next tested the effect of MARCH8 overexpression on the infectivity of particles bearing

209

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which has a 39 amino acid CT with five Lys residues. We also tested

210

a CT-truncated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which bears a 19-amino-acid truncation and contains one

211

Lys residue (Fig. 1). The infectivity of HIV-1 virions bearing WT or CT-truncated SARS-CoV-2

212

S protein was reduced by ~60% in the presence of MARCH8. We also mutated the Lys residues

213

in the CT of both WT and CT-truncated SARS-CoV-2 S proteins and observed ~50% reductions

214

in particle infectivity upon overexpression of MARCH8 in the virus-producer cell. The infectivity

215

of particles bearing truncated or Lys-mutant SARS-CoV-2 S proteins was modestly higher than

216

those bearing the WT S protein, likely due to disruption of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-

217

retention signal in the CT (48-50) (Fig. 2D). Expression of the inactive MARCH8-CS mutant

218

did not reduce the infectivity of particles bearing the WT SARS-CoV-2 S protein or the full-length

219

K-to-R mutant, but it did cause some reduction in the infectivity of virions bearing the CT-

220

truncated forms of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 2D).

221

We note that the effect of MARCH8 expression on the infectivity of particles bearing

222

EboV-GP or SARS-CoV-2 S protein is modest relative to its effect on the infectivity of particles

223

bearing VSV-G or HIV-1 Env. To investigate whether different levels of EboV-GP or SARS-

224

CoV-2 S protein expression would affect the MARCH8-mediated inhibition of pseudotype

225

infectivity, we performed transfections with a range of viral glycoprotein expression vector inputs.

226

In the case of EboV-GP, we observed a 40-50% reduction in pseudotyped particle infectivity

227

across the range of GP expression vector inputs (from 100-600 ng). In contrast, with SARS-CoV-

228

2, we observed a 4-fold reduction in infectivity with 100 ng input, but a more-modest 2-fold

229

reduction with a 400 ng input (data not shown).

230

Altogether, the data presented in Fig. 2 demonstrate that MARCH8 overexpression in the

231

virus-producer cell inhibits the infectivity of virus particles bearing each of the four viral

232

glycoproteins tested. The inhibitory activity of MARCH8 is largely abrogated by mutations

233

reported to block E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (CS and W114A), although some residual inhibitory

234

activity was observed with these mutants in some assays. Importantly, in the case of VSV-G,

235

MARCH8-mediated inhibition is dependent on the Lys residues in the CT, whereas inhibition of

236

HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein does not require the CT.

237
238

MARCH8 expression in virus-producer cells leads to viral envelope glycoprotein

239

degradation and reduced processing and virion incorporation. To investigate the mechanism

240

by which MARCH8 expression reduces the infectivity of virus particles bearing VSV-G we

241

transfected 293T cells with the Env(-) pNL4-3 molecular clone pNL4-3/KFS and the WT or

242

mutant VSV-G expression vectors, with or without MARCH8 expression vectors. VSV-G levels

243

in cell and virion fractions were quantified by western blot (WB). Cotransfection with an

244

expression vector for FLAG-tagged small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing

245

protein (SGTA) provided a loading control. As shown in Fig. 3A, overexpression of WT

246

MARCH8 markedly reduced (by ~3-fold) the expression of VSV-G in both cell and virion

247

fractions. Consistent with the lack of inhibition observed with the MARCH8-CS and MARCH8-

248

W114A mutants in the infectivity assays (Fig. 2), significant reductions in VSV-G levels were not

249

observed with these MARCH8 mutants (Figs. 3A and 3B) despite comparable WT and mutant

250

MARCH8 expression levels (Fig. 3A). Also consistent with the infectivity data, overexpression of

251

WT or mutant MARCH8 did not significantly affect levels of Tailless or K-to-R VSV-G mutants

252

in either cell or virus fractions. We also observed that overexpression of MARCH8 had no

253

significant effect on the expression of viral Gag proteins in cells or on virus release, which, together

254

with the observed lack of effect on SGTA expression levels, indicated that the reduction of VSV-

255

G levels in the presence of MARCH8 is not due to cytotoxicity or globally reduced protein

256

expression. Finally, we observed a more rapid mobility of VSV-G in the presence of WT but not

257

mutant MARCH8, presumably due to reduced VSV-G glycosylation induced by MARCH8

258

expression (Fig. 3A). This effect on VSV-G mobility was not observed with the Tailless or K-to-

259

R mutants, consistent with these mutants being resistant to MARCH8-mediated inhibition.

260

To measure the half-life of VSV-G in the presence or absence of MARCH8, we performed

261

pulse-chase analysis. 293T cells expressing WT VSV-G alone, or coexpressing VSV-G with

262

MARCH8, were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met/Cys for 20 min and chased for 0, 2, or 4 h in

263

unlabeled medium. We observed that MARCH8 overexpression reduced the levels of VSV-G, on

264

average, to 52% and 34% at 2 and 4 h, respectively, compared to 85% and 78% in the absence of

265

MARCH8 at those time points (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that MARCH8 overexpression

266

promotes the degradation of VSV-G, leading to reduced expression in cells and incorporation into

267

virions.

268

Similar experiments to those described above were performed with HIV-1 Env. MARCH8

269

expression significantly reduced the levels of both gp120 and gp41 in virions. The incorporation

270

of WT gp120 was not impaired by expression of the MARCH8 mutants, while the MARCH8-

271

W114A mutant modestly reduced (by ~40%) the levels of virion-associated gp120 for CTdel144

272

Env. The levels of virion-associated gp41 were markedly reduced for both WT and CTdel144 Env

273

in the presence of MARCH8, and the MARCH8 mutants did not exert a statistically significant

274

effect on virion gp41 levels (Fig. 4A and C). The reduced levels of virion-associated gp120 and

275

gp41 imposed by MARCH8 expression are consistent with the infectivity data presented above

276

(Fig. 2B). The expression of exogenous FLAG-tagged SGTA and HIV-1 Gag proteins in cells

277

was similar across the different transfected samples, indicating that expression of WT and mutant

278

MARCH8 is not cytotoxic under these conditions and no effect on virus particle production was

279

observed (Fig. 4A). These results demonstrate that MARCH8 expression in the virus-producer

280

cell reduces the levels of virion-associated gp120 and gp41 for both WT and gp41 CT-deleted

281

HIV-1 Env.

282

The EboV-GP bears a CT that contains only four residues, considerably shorter than the

283

CTs of either VSV-G or HIV-1 Env, yet it resembles HIV-1 Env in terms of the CT independence

284

of its inhibition by MARCH8 in infectivity assays (Fig. 2). To investigate the effect of MARCH8

285

expression on the processing and incorporation of EboV-GP, we analyzed the levels of cell- and

286

virion-associated EboV-GP in the presence and absence of MARCH8. The levels of cell- and

287

virion-associated EboV-GP were significantly reduced in the presence of WT MARCH8, but not

288

in the presence of the MARCH8-CS or MARCH8-W114A mutants (Fig. 5A and C). The

289

incorporation of the Tailless and K-to-A EboV-GP mutants was also reduced in the presence of

290

MARCH8 (Fig. 5A and B). We observed a significant reduction in the processing of EboV-GP0

291

in the presence of WT but not mutant MARCH8, as determined by the ratio of cell-associated

292

GP0/GP1 (Fig. 5A and D). As observed with VSV-G and HIV-1 Env, overexpression of WT or

293

mutant MARCH8 had no significant effect on cell-associated Gag expression or particle

294

production (Fig. 5A). These observations demonstrate that the MARCH8-mediated infectivity

295

defect observed with EboV-GP is due to impaired GP0 processing and correspondingly reduced

296

virion incorporation of GP1 and GP2, and this defect is independent of the EboV-GP CT.

297

As mentioned in the Introduction, MARCH8 expression has been reported to be high in

298

the lung (51), making its effect on the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 of particular interest.

299

Because the experiments described above demonstrated that neither inactive MARCH8 mutant

300

(MARCH8-CS or MARCH8-W114A) was capable of consistent antiviral activity, in these and

301

subsequent experiments we used only one mutant, MARCH8-CS, as our negative control. As

302

observed with HIV-1 Env and EboV-GP, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein shows a CT-independent

303

MARCH8-mediated restriction in infectivity assays (Fig. 2). To examine the effect of MARCH8

304

on SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression, we analyzed the levels of cell- and virion-associated S

305

protein in the presence and absence of WT or catalytically inactive MARCH8. We observed that

306

MARCH8 expression significantly reduced (by ~3-4 fold) the levels of S2 in cells and reduced S2

307

levels by ~10-fold in virions. Averaged over multiple assays, the MARCH8-CS mutant did not

308

significantly reduce S protein levels (Fig. 6A and C). Consistent with the infectivity data

309

presented above, the levels of the S protein mutants (K-to-R, CT-truncated, and CT-truncated K-

310

to-R) were also reduced in the presence of MARCH8. We also observed a 60-70% reduction in

311

the levels of WT and mutant S2 in the cell fraction in the presence of MARCH8, and noted the

312

presence of a smaller S2-related protein product (Fig. 6A, red arrow), which we speculate to be

313

a less-glycosylated form of S2. The reductions in S2, and the presence of the smaller S2 species,

314

were not observed upon expression of the MARCH8-CS mutant (Fig. 6A and B). Levels of the S

315

precursor protein were not reduced by expression of MARCH8 in the virus-producer cell,

316

suggesting an effect primarily on S protein processing. These data demonstrate that expression of

317

WT MARCH8 but not the MARCH8-CS mutant disrupts S protein processing, glycosylation, and

318

incorporation into virus particles and indicate that the MARCH8-imposed antagonism of SARS-

319

CoV-2 S protein is CT independent.

320

Because the effect of MARCH8 expression on both particle infectivity and glycoprotein

321

levels in virions varied across the four viral glycoproteins studied here, we calculated the

322

incorporation efficiency of each glycoprotein under the conditions used in the experiments

323

described above (Fig. S2). We observed that the Ebo-GP incorporation efficiency was quite high,

324

with nearly 40% of expressed GP present in VLPs. In contrast, the incorporation of SARS-CoV-

325

2 S protein was quite low, perhaps because HIV-1 particles assemble on the plasma membrane,

326

which, as noted in the Introduction, is not the normal site of SARS-CoV-2 assembly. Incorporation

327

efficiencies of HIV-1 gp41 and VSV-G were ~18% and ~8%, respectively, under these

328

experimental conditions (Fig. S2).

330

Knockdown of endogenous MARCH8 expression in HEK293T increases HIV-1 infectivity.

331

Although levels of basal MARCH8 expression are known to be relatively low in

332

established cell lines (51), we examined whether knock-down of MARCH8 gene expression in

333

HEK293T cells would affect the infectivity of HIV-1 particles produced from the MARCH8-

334

depleted cells. HEK293T cells were treated with siRNA targeting MARCH8 or with a non-

335

targeting control. MARCH8 expression was measured by RT-qPCR. At the highest siRNA input,

336

MARCH8 gene expression was reduced by approximately 5-fold (Fig. 7A).

337

conditions, we observed a modest but statistically significant increase in the infectivity of HIV-1

338

particles produced from the MARCH8-depleted cells (Fig. 7B). The infectivity of virus produced

339

from cells treated with the non-targeting siRNA control was not affected. These results

340

demonstrate that even low levels of endogenous MARCH8 expression can impair HIV-1

341

infectivity.

Under these

342
343

MARCH8 expression is highly and rapidly inducible in certain cell types by IFN stimulation.

344

Previous findings demonstrated that MARCH8 is highly expressed in MDMs in the

345

absence of IFN stimulation and that expression levels are not appreciably increased in either

346

MDMs or human CD4+ T cells by overnight stimulation with IFN- (11). Because IFN is known

347

to induce highly variable levels of gene expression in a time-, dose-, and cell type-dependent

348

manner (52, 53), and many genes with antiviral functions are IFN inducible (54), we performed

349

RT-qPCR time-course experiments with three different IFNs [IFN type-I ( and 𝛽) and II ()]

350

using total RNA extracted from different cell types and cell lines. We tested the SupT1 human T-

351

cell line, primary hPBMCs from four different donors, the A549 transformed alveolar epithelial

352

cell line, primary human airway epithelial cells, and HEK293T cells. In the SupT1 T-cell line,

353

MARCH8 gene expression was rapidly induced at 0.5 hr post-stimulation with IFN- up to 70-

354

fold over baseline levels, which subsided to ~10-fold over unstimulated levels by 4 hrs after

355

induction (Fig. 8A) and then returned to baseline. Treatment with IFN- induced a ~30-fold

356

increase in MARCH8 gene expression over baseline that peaked around 1-2 hrs post-IFN

357

stimulation (Fig. 8A). To examine MARCH8 gene expression in primary hPBMCs, cells from

358

four donors were IFN stimulated and MARCH8 RNA levels measured. In three of the four donors,

359

we observed that MARCH8 expression increased 5-8-fold over unstimulated levels at 0.5 hr post13

360

stimulation with IFN- and then returned to baseline by 2 hr post-stimulation (Fig. 8B). In one

361

donor, no IFN-inducible MARCH8 gene expression was observed (data not shown). To investigate

362

MARCH8 gene expression in cells that are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested

363

primary human airway epithelial cells and observed a ~3-fold increase in expression at 1-4 h post

364

IFN- stimulation (Fig. 8C). In HEK293T cells, we measured a rapid, ~7-fold increase in

365

MARCH8 gene expression after stimulation with IFN- Finally, we observed no IFN stimulation

366

of MARCH8 gene expression in A549 cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data indicate that

367

MARCH8 gene expression is induced to varying levels in cell lines and primary cells types that are

368

natural targets for HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

369

It is important to verify that the levels of exogenous MARCH8 gene expression achieved

370

in these assays were not excessive relative to endogenous levels present in relevant cell types.

371

Therefore, we investigated the MARCH8 RNA expression levels in transiently transfected

372

HEK293T cells upon increasing MARCH8 concentrations at 48 hr post-transfection. The results

373

indicated that MARCH8 expression at 0.05 and 0.1 g DNA input, the conditions used for the

374

analyses presented in Figs. 2-6, was ~4-5 fold above the levels in untransfected cells (Fig. 8E).

375

Transfection efficiencies were ~50% under these conditions (data not shown), indicating that

376

transfected cells expressed MARCH8 RNA at levels that were ~8-10 fold over those of

377

untransfected cells. These results show that exogenous levels of MARCH8 gene expression in our

378

transfected 293T cells were lower than those observed following IFN stimulation of the SupT1 T-

379

cell line and comparable to those measured in some IFN-stimulated hPBMC donors and HEK293T

380

cells at early time points after IFN stimulation (Fig. 8A-D). The levels of basal expression of

381

MARCH8 relative to the house-keeping gene GAPDH in all of these cell types were comparable

382

(Table S1). Collectively, our data demonstrate that MARCH8 gene expression can be induced

383

rapidly by IFN stimulation in different cell types: a human T-cell line, hPBMCs, human airway

384

epithelial cells and the HEK293T cell line. The levels of exogenous expression in our transfected

385

HEK293T cells were lower than, or comparable to, those achieved upon IFN stimulation at early

386

time points in the T-cell line, primary hPBMCs, and HEK293T cells.

MARCH8 retains VSV-G, HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S protein in an

391

glycoproteins, suggesting that MARCH8 might alter the trafficking of these viral glycoproteins.

392

To examine the effect of MARCH8 overexpression on the localization of different viral

393

glycoproteins, we performed confocal microscopy using HEK293T cells transfected with

394

MARCH8 or the inactive MARCH8-CS mutant. Our confocal data showed that MARCH8

395

localizes to the Golgi, a LAMP-1+ compartment, and the plasma membrane (Fig. S1) as previously

396

reported (51). All of the viral glycoproteins and mutants used in this study colocalized with

397

MARCH8 and MARCH8-CS with strong Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r) of ~0.7- 0.9 (Table

398

1) indicating that MARCH proteins and viral glycoproteins traffic through the same pathway. We

399

quantified the intracellular colocalization between the dsRed-Golgi marker and the different viral

400

glycoproteins in the presence of WT MARCH8 and the inactive MARCH8-CS and observed

401

strong colocalization (r=~0.7-0.9) (Table 1, Fig. 9 to 12).

402

In the absence of MARCH8 overexpression, we observed WT VSV-G localization

403

primarily in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane (Fig. 9A). MARCH8 but not MARCH8-CS

404

expression resulted in a marked shift in the localization of WT VSV-G from the plasma membrane

405

to an intracellular vesicular compartment (Fig. 9A). The predominantly plasma membrane

406

localization of the VSV-G Tailless (Fig. 9B) and VSV-G K-to-R (Fig. 9C) mutants was not shifted

407

by MARCH8 expression, consistent with the lack of MARCH8 targeting of these VSV-G mutants

408

in infectivity and western blotting analyses. We observed a strong colocalization (r ~ 0.89)

409

between WT VSV-G and the lysosomal marker LAMP-1 in the presence of WT MARCH8

410

expression (Fig. 9D; Table 1), whereas the Tailless and K-to-R VSV-G mutants showed low levels

411

of colocalization with LAMP-1 (r ~ 0.2). In the presence of the inactive MARCH8-CS mutant,

412

neither WT nor mutant VSV-G showed a high level of colocalization with LAMP-1 (r ~ 0.2) (Fig.

413

9E; Table 1). These data demonstrate that MARCH8 interferes with VSV-G trafficking and

414

targets it to a LAMP-1-positive compartment in a manner that requires the Lys residues in the

415

VSV-G CT.

416

We performed similar analyses with HIV-1 Env. As expected, WT and CTdel144 HIV-1

417

Env were observed in the Golgi and at the plasma membrane in the absence of MARCH8

418

expression (Fig. 10A and B). Similar to VSV-G, localization of WT HIV-1 Env was shifted in

419

cells expressing MARCH8, and a high level of colocalization (r ~0.8) with LAMP-1 was observed

420

(Fig. 10C; Table 1). In contrast to VSV-G, for which MARCH8-induced localization required

421

the CT, the Tailless form of HIV-1 Env, CTdel144, was strongly localized to a LAMP-1+

15

422

compartment in MARCH8-expressing cells (Fig. 10C; Table 1). The inactive MARCH8-CS did

423

not result in the retention of either WT or CTdel144 HIV-1 Env in a LAMP-1+ compartment (Fig.

424

10D). These findings are consistent with the infectivity and western blotting data presented above,

425

and indicate that the reductions in HIV-1 Env processing and incorporation in the presence of

426

MARCH8 are associated with the retention of Env in an internal, LAMP-1+ compartment.

427

The confocal microscopy data obtained with EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S protein

428

paralleled our observations with HIV-1 Env but diverged from the results obtained with VSV-G.

429

Expression of MARCH8 but not MARCH8-CS reduced the expression of these viral glycoproteins

430

on the cell-surface and induced their retention in an internal, LAMP-1+ compartment. The

431

localization of truncated and K-to-R EboV-GP and S protein mutants was also shifted by

432

MARCH8 expression (Figs. 11 and 12; Table 1).

433

Taken together, the confocal microscopy data demonstrate that MARCH8 expression

434

redirects the localization of viral glycoproteins by two distinct mechanisms. In the case of VSV-

435

G, the CT is required for the MARCH8-induced relocalization to a LAMP-1+ compartment and

436

mutation of the Lys residues in the CT abrogates the ability of MARCH8 expression to disrupt the

437

localization of the viral glycoprotein. In contrast, for HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S

438

protein, neither the CT nor the Lys residues in the CT are required for MARCH8-induced

439

relocalization. The microscopy data are thus consistent with the infectivity and western blotting

440

data (Fig. 2-6) showing that the ability of MARCH8 to antagonize VSV-G is dependent on the CT

441

but the antagonism of the other viral glycoproteins tested is CT independent.

DISCUSSION

446

envelope glycoproteins – specifically, HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

447

Expression of MARCH8 in the virus-producer cell reduced levels of viral glycoprotein processing

448

for those glycoproteins that undergo furin-mediated cleavage, reduced glycoprotein stability, and

449

interfered with glycoprotein incorporation into HIV-1 particles. In the case of VSV-G, MARCH8-

450

mediated antagonism required the CT of the viral glycoprotein, and Lys residues in the CT were

451

essential for MARCH8 restriction. In contrast, in the case of HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP, and SARS-

452

CoV-2 S protein, the CT of the viral glycoprotein was not required for the antiviral effect. In all

453

cases, however, the ubiquitin ligase activity of MARCH8 was required for restriction, as RING

In this study, we examined the ability of MARCH8 to antagonize a wide range of viral

454

domain mutations to a large extent abrogated the inhibition. While this manuscript was in

455

preparation, another group reported that, as we observed here, MARCH8-mediated restriction of

456

VSV-G was CT-dependent but antagonism of HIV-1 Env was CT-independent, and they

457

demonstrated MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination of VSV-G (55). These results support a model

458

whereby the RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MARCH8 either directly targets the CT

459

of the viral glycoprotein – as has been shown for MARCH protein-mediated downregulation of a

460

variety of cellular proteins (18) – or exerts its effect indirectly. In either case, the consequence of

461

MARCH8 activity is the apparent redirection of the viral glycoproteins to a LAMP-1+

462

compartment.

463

glycoproteins.

This is consistent with MARCH8 inducing lysosomal degradation of viral

464

While MARCH8 expression antagonized each of the glycoproteins tested here, the

465

magnitude of the effect varied across the different glycoproteins, in terms of both particle

466

infectivity and glycoprotein incorporation into virions. Specifically, the inhibition of VSV-G and

467

HIV-1 Env was quite severe, whereas more modest effects were observed with EboV-GP and

468

SARS-CoV-2 S.

469

incorporation efficiency; for example, EboV-GP was very efficiently incorporated into HIV-1

470

particles, whereas SARS-CoV-2 S protein was inefficiently incorporated. Further study will be

471

required to determine the basis for the variable activity of MARCH8 against the four glycoproteins

472

examined in this study.

The degree of inhibition did not correlate with the viral glycoprotein

473

It remains unclear at what stage during their trafficking pathway viral glycoproteins are

474

targeted by MARCH8. MARCH8 could act early during trafficking of the viral glycoprotein

475

through the Golgi en route to the site of virus assembly, at the plasma membrane, or, in the case

476

of glycoproteins like HIV-1 Env that undergo a recycling step, could act late following endocytic

477

uptake from the plasma membrane. MARCH proteins have been reported to target a large

478

repertoire of cellular proteins, including innate/adaptive immune receptors and intracellular

479

adhesion molecules (18). Previous studies have shown that the overexpression of MARCH

480

proteins can cause redistribution of syntaxin 4 and syntaxin 6 as well as some syntaxin-6-

481

interacting soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs),

482

which are known to be involved in cellular endosomal trafficking (56, 57). MARCH protein

483

overexpression has also been reported to alter the trafficking of clathrin-independent endocytosis

484

(CIE) cargo proteins, rerouting them to endosomes and lysosomes for degradation (29). Thus, the

485

indirect mechanism of MARCH8-mediated targeting of viral glycoproteins that we hypothesize

486

would involve the ubiquitination and downregulation of cellular factor(s) involved in viral

487

glycoprotein trafficking. The resulting accumulation of the viral glycoprotein in a LAMP-1+

488

intracellular compartment (Figs. 9-12), would reduce virion incorporation of the viral glycoprotein

489

and impair particle infectivity. Taken together, our data suggest that MARCH8 exerts its antiviral

490

activity via two different mechanisms, one (e.g., as observed for VSV-G) in which the CT of the

491

viral glycoprotein is directly ubiquitinated, the other (e.g., as observed for HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP,

492

and SARS-CoV-2 S) in which host trafficking factor(s) are targeted, resulting in an indirect

493

restriction of the viral glycoprotein.

494

The viral homologs of the cellular MARCH proteins have been reported to ubiquitinate

495

residues other than Lys in the CTs of their target proteins; for example, the K3 protein of KSHV

496

has been reported to attach ubiquitin to Cys residues and the mK3 protein of gamma herpesviruses

497

can ubiquitinate Ser and Thr in addition to Lys (35-37, 58). It is not clear whether MARCH

498

proteins are able to ubiquitinate non-Lys residues, but we cannot exclude this possibility.

499

Inspection of the viral glycoproteins under study indicates that the truncated HIV-1 Env mutant

500

CTdel144 and EboV-GP Tailless have no Ser, Thr or Cys residues facing the cytosol, indicating

501

that their CTs cannot be ubiquitinated. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 S-Trun has 4 Ser, 1 Thr and 10

502

Cys residues. Ongoing work is investigating whether the CT of SARS-CoV-2 S protein undergoes

503

MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination. It is interesting to note that the basic residues in the CT of

504

HIV-1 gp41 are highly skewed towards Arg instead of Lys residues; for example, the CT of the

505

NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 used in this study contains 21 Arg residues but only two Lys residues

506

(https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html). This observation invites the

507

speculation that HIV-1 may have evolved to limit the number of Lys residues available for gp41

508

CT ubiquitination.

509

Our results show a broad antiviral activity of MARCH8 against the glycoproteins from

510

three human viral pathogens – HIV-1, EboV, and SARS-CoV-2 – and a primarily animal pathogen,

511

VSV. MARCH8 targeting of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, and, very recently, EboV-GP, has been reported

512

(6, 8, 11, 55, 59). HIV-1 replicates predominantly in CD4+ T cells and also infects MDM (60).

513

EboV targets mainly alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells (61); SARS-CoV-2, like other

514

coronaviruses, targets airway epithelial cells (62); and VSV typically replicates in cells of the oral

515

mucosa, although VSV-G confers very broad tissue tropism (63). In this study, we relied

extensively on expressing MARCH8 exogenously to evaluate its effect on viral envelope

517

glycoprotein stability, trafficking, and incorporation. This raises the question of whether the levels

518

of MARCH8 expression achieved in these experiments are physiologically relevant. A previous

519

study demonstrated that depletion of MARCH8 in primary human MDM significantly increased

520

the infectivity of HIV-1 particles released from these cells, suggesting that at least in this cell type

521

endogenous levels of MARCH8 expression are sufficient to restrict HIV-1 infectivity (11).

522

MARCH8 expression is high in the lung (19), suggesting its potential relevance to infection by

523

respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2. Due to the poor quality of available MARCH8 antibodies,

524

we could not evaluate endogenous MARCH8 protein expression. Instead, qRT-PCR was used to

525

measure the endogenous MARCH8 gene expression in relevant cell types in the presence and

526

absence of IFN. In the absence of IFN stimulation, basal levels of MARCH8 RNA, measured as a

527

ratio to GAPDH, were similar across the cell types analyzed. The RNA levels measured following

528

IFN induction were comparable to those in transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Although RNA

529

levels may not be directly correlated with protein expression, the results suggest that the MARCH8

530

expression in the cell types tested may be sufficient to exert an antiviral activity. Indeed, even in

531

the absence of IFN stimulation, we observed that depletion of MARCH8 in HEK293T cells caused

532

a modest but statistically significant increase in the infectivity of particle produced from those

533

cells. In addition, our data indicate that MARCH8 is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG). The type I

534

IFN (IFN-I) response is crucial in the host antiviral defense against viral infections (64, 65). A

535

recent publication highlighted the importance of the IFN-I response in immune protection against

536

SARS-COV-2 by establishing a link between life-threatening COVID-19 symptoms and loss-of-

537

function mutations in IFN-I-related genes (66).

538

Viruses, including those whose envelope glycoproteins were studied here, have evolved a

539

complex array of countermeasures to disable the function of cellular ISGs (67) . Further work will

540

be required to elucidate mechanisms by which viruses counteract the antiviral activity of the

541

MARCH family of E3 ubiquitin ligases.

Figure S1. MARCH8 is localized in the endolysosomal compartments and at the plasma

1031

membrane. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with MARCH8 expression vector (200 ng) and

1032

the LAMP1-RFP or pDsRed-Golgi-Beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (300 ng) expression vectors.

1033

Cells were fixed, processed and stained with anti-HA to detect MARCH8. Scale bars = 10 µm.

1034

Images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. Colocalization between

1035

MARCH8 and subcellular compartment markers was assessed by calculating the Pearson’s

1036

correlation coefficient (r values) + SD using 50 cells per condition.

CoV-2 S protein. Two days post-transfection, cell and viral lysates were prepared and subjected

1043

to western blot analysis with antibodies against gp41, VSV-G, EboV GP2, or SARS-CoV-2 S2.

1044

The levels of viral glycoprotein in cell and virus lysates were quantified and incorporation

1045

efficiency was calculated as the amount of virion-associated glycoprotein relative to total

1046

glycoprotein in cell and virus. Data shown are + SD from three independent experiments. Plasmid
