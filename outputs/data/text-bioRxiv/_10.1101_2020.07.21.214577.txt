Abstract
Covid-19 has infected more than 14 million people worldwide causing over 600.000 deaths1. The disease
is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which shares a high
sequence similarity to SARS CoV2. Currently there are no vaccinations available to provide protection and
the only antiviral therapy in active use in patients is remdesivir, which currently provides only limited
benefit3. Hence, there is an urgent need for antiviral therapies against SARS CoV 2. SARS CoV requires Ca2+
ions for host cell entry4 and based on the similarity between SARS CoV and SARS CoV 25 it is highly likely
that the same requirements exist for the two viruses. Here, we tested whether FDA-approved calcium
channel blocker (CCB) drugs are efficacious to inhibit the spread of SARS CoV 2 in cell culture. Our data
shows that amlodipine, felodipine and nifedipine limit the growth of SARS CoV 2 in epithelial kidney (Vero
E6) and epithelial lung (Calu-3) cells. We observed some differences in the inhibition efficacy of the drugs
in the two different cell lines, but with felodopine and nifedipine having the greatest effect. Overall, our

data suggest that CCBs have a high potential to treat SARS CoV 2 infections and their current FDA approval
would allow for a fast repurposing of these drugs.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are major zoonotic pathogens that cause respiratory and/or enteric tract infections
in a variety of species including humans. Most CoVs that are pathogenic to humans cause only mild coldlike disease symptoms6. However, in 2002 the highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) CoV emerged followed by the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV in 2012. SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV exhibited case fatalities rates of 11% and 34%, respectively, and patients infected with
either SARS CoV or MERS CoV expressed very similar clinical symptoms7–10. Currently, the worldwide
Covid-19 outbreak caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) CoV 2 poses a dramatic risk
to public health worldwide11. The virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and since
has spread all over the globe12. To this date, there are no vaccines or highly efficacious drugs available
against SARS CoV, MERS CoV, or SARS CoV 2.
In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized three drugs for use against Covid-19 which
are the RNA dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir, initially developed for Ebola treatment, and
the two anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. However, while the latter two have been
proven to not be suitable for Covid-19 treatment, remdesivir was shown some improvement in symptoms
of 68% of treated patients in clinical trials3,13. Overall, there remains need to identify and to provide
additional drugs that help to treat Covid-19 patients. Given the current pandemic and the need for
expediency, ideally, these drugs are already FDA approved and therefore need to be only repurposed,
avoiding the lengthy approval process.
Current antiviral therapies often target virus replication or virus release; examples being remdesivir or
influenza neuraminidase inhibitors, respectively3,14. A viable target for a potential drug is the viral entry of
the virus into the host cells as this is a crucial step in the viral life cycle5. For SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV 2 and
MERS-CoV the spike (S) protein mediates binding to the respective receptor via its S1 domain and initiates
the fusion with the host cell via its S2 domain5. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the S protein has been
studied extensively and it becomes more and more apparent that SARS-CoV-2 S functions in a very similar
fashion5. Previous studies have revealed that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV utilize calcium ions (Ca2+) that are
coordinated by amino acid residues within the fusion peptide to form a fusion loop that integrates into

the host cell membrane4,15. Depleting intracellular and/or extracellular Ca2+ resulted in full suppression of
viral entry for SARS CoV and partial reduction of viral fusion of MERS CoV. Sequence comparisons have
shown that the fusion domains of SARS CoV and SARS CoV 2 are virtually identical and hence, strongly
suggesting that the same Ca2+-dependency for viral entry exists for SAR- CoV-25.
The crucial role of Ca2+ in the viral entry of CoVs prompted us to explore whether FDA approved Ca2+
channel blocker (CCB) drugs have the potential to inhibit viral growth of SARS-CoV-2. We chose five drugs
from different classes that all inhibit high voltage-activated Ca2+ channels of the L-type. We selected the
dihydropyridines: amlodipine, nifedipine and felodipine; the phenylalkylamine: verapamil; and the
benzothiazepine: diltiazem. These five drugs are primarily used to treat cardio-vascular diseases. In
addition, we also tested the FDA-approved Ca2+ chelator drug: diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA),
which is used against radioactive contaminations of internal organs.
Results
Amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine and verapamil inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells
To test the whether the five CCBs and the Ca2+ chelator DTPA inhibit growth of SARS-CoV-2, we infected
Vero E6 cells at a MOI of 0.1 and added four different concentrations of each compound immediately post
infection. The tested concentrations were 10 µM, 50 µM, 100 µM and 500 µM and viral titers were
analyzed 24 hours post infection. For amlodipine, we observed a 5-log reduction of viral growth at 50 µM
and we were not able to detect any viral titer at a concentration of 100 µM (Figure 1A). However,
amlodipine also exhibited a 25% reduction of cell viability at a concentration of 50 µM, which increased
to 90% at 100 µM and 500 µM (Figure 2A). Nifedipine only reduced viral titers by 5 logs at a high
concentration (500 µM) and expressed about 15% cytotoxicity (Figure 1A and 2A). Felodipine completely
suppressed growth of SARS CoV 2 at a concentration of 50 µM with no statistically significant cytotoxicity
(Figure 1A and 2A). 100 µM verapamil reduced the viral titers by 50% compared to the untreated control
without a cytotoxic effect (Figure 1A and 2A). Diltiazem reduced viral growth at 500 µM but also
compromised cell viability at this concentration and DTPA showed no effect (Figure 1A and 2A).
Nifedipine and felodipine suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial lung cells
Vero E6 cells are a good model system for SARS-CoV-2 infections, but the cell line is derived from epithelial
kidney cells and may not represent the virus-drug-cell interactions in the lung. Therefore, we tested the
CCBs and the Ca2+ chelator DTPA in the epithelial lung cell line Calu-3. The results for amlodipine were
comparable to what we found in Vero cells (Figure 1B and 2B). Nifedipine and felodipine, however,

significantly inhibited viral growth at lower concentrations compared to what was observed in Vero E6
cells. Nifedipine reduced the viral titers by 1.5 logs at a concentration of 100 µM and no virus was
detectable at 500 µM while cytotoxicity was moderate (Figure 1B and 2B). Felodipine diminished SARSCoV-2 growth by half at 10 µM and at 50 µM no virus was detected anymore with no cytotoxic effect
(Figure 1B and 2B). In contrast, verapamil had a weakened inhibitory effect at 100 µM compared to Vero
E6 cells (Figure 1B and 2B). As in Vero cells, 100 µM verapamil fully suppressed viral growth but also
compromised cell viability by about 90%. We found very modest infection inhibition for diltiazem and
DTPA at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 500 µM and 100 µM, respectively (Figure 1B and 2B).
Discussion
Overall, of the tested CCBs, felodipine provides the best candidate drug for repurposing. Felodipine fully
inhibited growth of SARS-CoV-2 in both tested cell types at a concentration of 50 µM while we did not
observe significant cytotoxicity (Figure 1 and 2). Nifedipine is another promising candidate as it
suppressed viral growth particularly well in epithelial lung cells at concentrations that were not cytotoxic
(Figure 1 and 2). Application of all other tested CCBs resulted in reduced titers too, but their effect seemed
to be inferior compared to felodipine and nifedipine. Amlodipine treatment resulted in very low or
undetectable titers but even low concentrations of the drug had cytotoxic effects. Verapamil and diltiazem
application led to partially reduced SARS CoV 2 growth in Vero cells, but suppressed growth only to a
minor extent in Calu-3 cells (Figure 1 and 2). The Ca2+ chelator DTPA had no major effect in the tested cell
lines. In conclusion, felodipine and nifedipine represent strong drug candidates for the treatment of Covid19.
The observed inhibition differences in the different cell lines suggest that inhibition may occur at the level
of host cell entry. In Vero cells, CoVs preferentially enter the host cells via the endocytic pathway utilizing
endosomal proteases, such as cathepsins, for S protein activation5,16. Calu-3 cells, on the contrary, are
predominantly infected via plasma membrane fusion and cleavage of S is mediated by TMPRSS2 and
furin5,17. Felodipine and nifedipine was more efficacious in Calu-3 cells at concentrations of 10 µM and 50
µM compared to Vero cells, respectively. In contrast, 100 µM verapamil reduced viral growth in Vero cells
by 3 logs but there was barely a reduction of viral titers in Calu-3 cells. Others that have previously
reported that CCBs inhibit viral infections at the cell entry level. Influenza A infections, for example, trigger
an influx of Ca2+ which assists the endocytic uptake of the virus while treatment with verapamil or
diltiazem inhibits viral infection18–20. New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses, such as the Junin virus,
are reportedly sensitive to CCBs and treatment with CCBs blocks the entry of the virus into the host cell21.

However, the exact mechanism how CCBs suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be addressed in a
separate study. CCBs were also shown to interfere with viral infections of several other viruses (e.g.
Japanese Encephalitis virus, Zika virus, Dengue virus) at the stage of viral replication22, thus until further
study, it cannot be excluded that CCBs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 propagation at different stages, including
virus release.
Covid-19 infections typically manifest in the upper respiratory tract23. Therefore, it is important to
emphasize that felodipine and nifedipine work with higher efficiency in the lung cell line Calu-3 compared
to the kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (Figure 1A and 1B). In this context, it is noteworthy that CCBs are
believed to not only affect cardiovascular muscles but also airway smooth muscle cells, which rely on Ltype calcium channels for their contraction24–26. A recent study using the CCBs tested here for their
potential to improve lung function in asthma patients and concluded there was a beneficial effect,
providing evidence that CCBs act in the lungs27. This also links to the observation that asthma is not on the
top ten list of chronic health problems that people suffered from who died of Covid-19 as one would
expect this respiratory condition to be. Nebulizers used for asthma medications are supplemented with
EDTA as a preservative which may help to deplete extracellular Ca2+27 supporting the idea that interfering
with cellular Ca2+ affects SARS CoV 2 growth.
CBBs have a high potential to treat Covid-19 patients
In summary, we provide strong evidence that CBBs, in particular nifedipine and felodipine, inhibit infection
of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells and hence, present a high potential to treat Covid-19 patients. There is already
evidence that nifedipine and amlodipine decrease mortality and the risk for intubation and ventilation in
elderly Covid-19 patients28. Therefore, we believe that CCBs, possibly in combination with remdesivir,
could provide the relief for Covid-19 patients until vaccines have been successfully developed. Moreover,
CCBs could represent a novel class of antiviral therapeutics against a variety of viruses including MERSCoV and SARS-CoV and those yet to emerge, given the strong conservation of the Ca2+ binding region in
CoVs.

Methods
Cells and reagents
Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Cellgro) supplemented with 25 mM HEPES
(Cellgro) and 10% HyClone FetalClone II (GE) at 37° C and 5% CO2. For virus infections, cells were grown in
Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (Cellgro) supplemented with 4% heat inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Gibco) at 37° C and 5% CO2.
The SARS CoV 2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was obtained from the Biological and Emerging Infections
Resources Program (BEI Resources). Amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, verapamil, diltiazem and DTPA
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MMT)
was obtained from Thermo Fisher. Crystal violet was purchased from VWR.
SARS-CoV-2 infections and TCID50 assays
Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells were grown to confluency under biosafety level-2 (BSL 2) conditions. Cells were
then transferred to the BSL-3 lab, washed with DBPS and a volume of 200 µL infection media with SARS-

CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 was added to the cells. Cells were then incubated at 37° C and 5% CO2 for 1 hour
on a rocker. Cells were then supplemented with 800 µL infection media and appropriate concentrations
of each drug were added. Amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine and verapamil were dissolved in DMSO.
Therefore, DMSO was used as a control at the same quantity that was applied for the highest drug
concentration. After 24 hours the supernatants were harvested and stored at -80° C.
For the TCID50, Vero E6 cells were grown to confluency in 96 well plates and serial dilution of the samples
were prepared. Undiluted and diluted samples were then added to the Vero E6 cells and grown for 72
hours at 37° C and 5% CO2. After 72 hours supernatants were aspirated, and cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Cells were then stained with 0.5% crystal violet and subsequently washed with dH2O.
Wells were scored and analyzed for living or dead cells according to the Reed-Muench method30.
Cytotoxicity assay
The cytotoxicity of the calcium ion blocking drugs (amlodipine, nifedipine, felodipine, diltiazem) and
calcium chelator (DTPA) on VeroE6 and Calu-3 cells were determined by an MTT Assay. A total of 5 × 105
VeroE6 cells/well, and 6.7 × 105 Calu-3 cells/well were incubated in the presence of the six calcium
blocking drugs and calcium chelator at the concentrations of 10, 50, 100, and 500 µM for 24 hour at 37°C
C and 5% CO2 in a CO2 incubator. After 24 hours incubation, cells were treated with MTT solution (5
mg/mL) and incubated for 4 hr at 37°C C and 5% CO2 with rocking to allow purple formazan crystals to
form. 50 µL DMSO was added into each well to dissolve the crystals. The absorbance was measured at
540 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instrument Co., WA, USA).
