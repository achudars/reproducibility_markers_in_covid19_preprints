Abstract

20

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of

21

the COVID-19 pandemic, has spread globally. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

22

has been identified as the host cell receptor that binds to receptor-binding domain (RBD)

23

of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein and mediates cell entry. Because the ACE2 proteins are

24

widely available in mammals, it is important to investigate the interactions between the

25

RBD and the ACE2 of other mammals. Here we analyzed the sequences of ACE2 proteins

26

from 16 mammals and predicted the structures of ACE2-RBD complexes. Analyses on

27

sequence, structure, and dynamics synergistically provide valuable insights into the

28

interactions between ACE2 and RBD. The comparison results suggest that the ACE2 of

29

bovine, cat and panda form strong binding with RBD, while in the cases of rat, least

30

horseshoe bat, horse, pig, mouse and civet, the ACE2 proteins interact weakly with RBD.

Introduction

36

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, is

37

responsible for the new type of severe pneumonia COVID-19 [1]. As of December 6, 2020,

38

over 66 million people have been tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2, and the number of

39

infections still rapidly increases [2]. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the human angiotensin-converting

40

enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) to initiate the spike protein binding and to facilitate the viral

41

attachment to host cells[3–8]. Recently, reports of other animals testing positive for SARS-

42

CoV-2 are emerging. Studies on viral replication and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2

43

suggested that the virus replicates efficiently in cats or ferrets [9]. There are reports of dog,

44

cat and tiger testing positive for SARS-CoV-2[10–12]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to

45

study the susceptibility of those mammalian animals, which are in close contact with humans.

46

Because ACE2 proteins exist in many mammailian animals, potentially making them

47

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, we gathered ACE2 sequences of 16 animals for detailed

48

analysis (See Table 1). By studying the interactions between the receptor binding domain

49

(RBD) of virus spike protein and ACE2 receptors, we hope to provide information on animal

50

susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2. It has been established that the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2

51

(denoted as RBD hereafter) and the human ACE2 (hACE2) form stable complexes, as shown

52

in recently determined crystal structures[13,14] and computer simulations[15]. This provides

53

an opportunity to investigate the interactions between RBD and ACE2 of other mammalian

54

animals. Although such knowledge alone is not sufficient to accurately predict the

55

susceptibility of animals to SARS-CoV-2, the information is valuable in understanding the

56

interactions between RBD and ACE2.

The conservation of ACE2 residues and structures of ACE2-RBD complexes are reported in

63

a few studies [16–18], dynamics simulations were also applied to investigate the dynamical

64

features of the ACE2-RBD interactions[19,20]. In this report, we combined sequence

65

analysis, structure prediction, molecular dynamics to investigate the interactions between

66

ACE2 and RBD. Using the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2

67

complex (hACE2-RBD) as the template[21], ACE2-RBD complex structures were

68

constructed for previously mentioned ACE2 proteins, and the dynamics of these complexes

69

were investigated using simulations. Based on conservation in ACE2 residues, similarity in

70

electrostatic potentials, and dynamical interactions revealed from simulations, we classified

71

these ACE2-RBD interactions into weak, medium, and strong categories.

72
73

Materials and Methods

74

Homology modeling of the ACE2-RBD complex structures

75

The ACE2 sequences were obtained from the NCBI and uniport databases[22,23]. Using

76

the SWISS-MODEL interactive server[24], we modeled structures for 15 mammalian

77

ACE2 proteins, based on hACE2 structure (PDB ID: 6LZG[21]). Then, the SARS-CoV-2

78

RBD and ACE2 complexes were assembled by superposing the homology structure of

79

ACE2 proteins to hACE2-RBD complex structure.

81

PyMOL (https://pymol.org/2/) was utilized to compute and visualize the electrostatic

82

potential maps at the ACE2-RBD complex interfaces. These maps depict the electrostatic

83

potential surface rendered from the numerical solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann

84

equation[25]. The electrostatic potential surfaces were simplified into 2D projection

85

images for pairwise comparison and clustering analysis. The hierarchical clustering

86

algorithm was applied to group these 2D projection images.

87

Molecular dynamics simulations of ACE2-RBD complexes

88

GROMACS-5.1.2[26] was used to carry out MD simulations of ACE2-RBD complexes.

89

All complexes were parametrized with CHARMM27 force fields [27]. Disulfide bonds

90

were maintained as in the crystal structure of hACE2-RBD complex. Complexes were

91

solvated in the triclinic box with a minimum distance of 10 Å between the complex and the

92

box boundaries. Solvated systems were neutralized by adding ions (Na+ and Cl-) to 0.15

93

mM. Then, these systems were subjected to steepest descent energy minimization,

94

followed by constant volume (NVT) and constant pressure of 1 bar (NPT) equilibrations,

95

for 1 ns and 3 ns respectively. During system equilibration, positional restraints were

96

applied on non-hydrogen atoms of ACE2-RBD complexes. Temperature and pressure were

97

controlled by the V-rescale method[28] and Parrinello-Rahman method[29], respectively.

98

Finally, 50 ns production simulations were carried out at NPT condition. VMD[30] and

99

UCSF Chimera[31] were used to visualize and analyze simulation trajectories. The

100

physical binding interactions comprising van der Waals and electrostatic components were

101

calculated between each ACE2 and RBD for the structures sampled in MD simulations.

102
103

Results and Discussions

104

Sequence analysis and the conservation at the RBD binding interface. Multiple

105

sequence alignment was carried out using CLUSTALW program[32],[33], and the aligned

106

sequences were redrawn with the human ACE2 crystal structure as the reference using the

107

ESPript webserver[34]. All ACE2 proteins comprise amino acids from position 19 to 614,

108

except for dog ACE2, which has a deletion at position 20 (Figure 1 and Figure S1). In the

109

human ACE2-RBD complex, the amino acids of ACE2 at the N-terminal helix-1 (residues

110

19-42), near the η1 (residues 82-83), helix-13 (residue 330) and β-hairpin-4,5 (residues

111

352-357), have been identified as the key residues (Figure 1) that bind to the RBD [13,15].

114

sequence alignment analysis.

115

Based on the hACE2-RBD structure, we further identified 13 key residues on the RBD-

116

interacting interface and analyzed their sequence conservations comparing to hACE2 (Figure

117

2). Siberian tiger and cat share the same ACE2 protein residues among these 13 residues, so

118

the analysis on tiger ACE2 is inferred from cat ACE2. Taking hACE2 sequence as the

119

reference, substituted residues of these 13 positions are summarized in Figure 2A and Table

120

S1. We found that residues at positions 24, 27, 31, 34 and 82 are highly variable among these

121

ACE2 proteins. The H34 of hACE2 has the largest variation, which is substituted by Q (Rat,

122

Mouse and Rabbit), Y (Dog, Giant Panda and Civet), S (Pangolin, Horse and Least

123

Horseshoe Bat), L (Pig), and T (Chinese Horseshoe Bat). The Q24 has four variations: K (Rat

124

and Least Horseshoe Bat), N (Mouse), L (Rabbit, Dog, Cat, Giant Panda, Civet, Pangolin,

125

Pig and Horse), and E (Chinese Horseshoe Bat). T27, K31, and M82 all have three different

126

substitutions, while D30 and M82 have two different possible substitutions. Figure 2B shows

127

the number of identical residues to hACE2 at these 13 positions. Bovine and sheep ACE2

128

proteins differ from hACE2 at only two positions, while the ACE2 proteins of mouse, rat and

129

civet are different from hACE2 at 7 out of 13 positions.

Electrostatic potential surface at the binding interface. The electrostatic potential surfaces

for the central region of ACE2 helix-1 (residues 30-37) are shown in Figure 3 for all ACE2-

138

RBD complexes. According to electrostatic potential maps, this region features a charge

139

distribution composed of both positively and negatively charged sites in human, bovine and

140

cat ACE2, while the electrostatic potentials are mostly negative for dog and pig ACE2

141

proteins. Clustering analysis on electrostatic potential surfaces showed that the

142

bovine/sheep/pig/rabbit ACE2 proteins have similar features as hACE2 in this region (Figure

143

3C). The mouse/rate/least-horseshoe-bat ACE2 show the least similarity in the electrostatic

144

potential features in this region comparing to other ACE2 proteins.

Hierarchical clustering results based on similarity between electrostatic potential surfaces

Binding interactions assessed from MD simulation data. Simulation trajectories of 16

153

ACE2-RBD complexes were analyzed with a focus on the ACE2 residues at the binding

154

interface (Figure S2-S4). Considering the critical roles of hydrogen bonding interactions

155

between ACE2 and RBD, we focused on the analysis of interfacing hydrogen bonds. The

156

occupancies of hydrogen bonds were calculated from simulation trajectories (Figure 4 and

157

Figure S5). For these ACE2-RBD complexes, five frequently observed hydrogen bonds are

158

D30:K417, E35:Q493, Y83:N487, K353:G502 and D355:T500 (ACE2 residues are placed on

159

the left of colon, and RBD residues on the right). In the following, detailed discussions are

160

grouped based on the number of substitutions among the 13 key residues.

161

Bovine ACE2-RBD shows a highly similar hydrogen bonding pattern as hACE2-RBD

162

(Figure 4). Cat ACE2 shows even stronger hydrogen bonding interactions with RBD than

163

hACE2, but the hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Y41 and T500 is absent (Figure 4). Cat

164

ACE2-RBD also exhibits the highest interaction energy among 16 ACE2-RBD complexes

165

(see Table 2). This is consistent with recent reports on domestic cat being infected by SARS-

166

CoV-2[9,10]. A recently resoved complex structure of cat ACE2-RBD reveals similar

167

binding as the hACE2-RBD complex[35]. Experimental data also show that cats are efficient

168

in replicating SARS-CoV-2 [9], suggesting that four substitutions do not inhibit RBD binding.

169

Panda and pig ACE2 proteins both differ from hACE2 at four positions, but their interactions

170

with RBD are quite different. Panda ACE2 forms 9 strong hydrogen bonds with RBD

171

(Figure 4). The pig ACE2 interacts with RBD more weakly than panda ACE2, in line with

172

experimental studies showing that SARS-CoV-2 infection was not detectable in pigs or their

173

cell lines[36]. The difference in the interaction profiles of panda and pig may be due to Y34L

174

substitution and the influences from other domains of ACE2.

175

Dog and horse ACE2 have five substitutions (four are at positions 24,30,34,82; and one

176

occurs at position 38 for dog and position 41 for horse). Dog is the first domestic animal

177

reported testing positive with a low level of SARS-CoV-2 infection[37,38]. The dog ACE2

178

contains a deletion at position 20 (threonine in human ACE2), but this deletion does not

179

appear to affect the complex structures revealed in the homology models. In the case of dog

180

ACE2-RBD (Figure S3), S19, E37, Y40, Q41 do not form hydrogen bonds with RBD

181

(Figure S5), weakening the interactions of dog ACE2 with RBD. Horse ACE2 forms only 3

182

hydrogen bonds with RBD (Figure 4).

183

With respect to hACE2, pangolin, CH-bat and LH-bat ACE2 differ at 6 positions. Due to the

184

co-evolution with other coronaviruses, pangolin and bats were speculated to be intermediate

185

hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Despite having 6 substitutions, pangolin ACE2 forms strong

186

interactions with RBD. Previously, Q24K mutant of ACE2 revealed a slight inhibition effect

187

on the binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein, and the binding is abolished for

188

K31D mutant[39]. The high similarity between RBD of the two coronaviruses suggest that

189

the mutant may exert a similar effect to SARS-CoV-2 infection. LH-bat ACE2 has both

190

substitutions, leading to weak interactions with only 6 hydrogen bonds (Figure 4).

191

Civet, mouse, and rat have 7 substitutions in their ACE2 compared to hACE2. Civets can be

192

infected by coronaviruses in natural environments [40]. In civet ACE2, the important

193

hydrogen bond D30:K417 in hACE2-RBD is not formed between E30 of civet ACE2 and

194

K417 of RBD (Figure 4). Mouse ACE2 shows the weakest interaction with RBD, with only

195

3 hydrogen bonds. The mutation Y83F in both mouse/rat results in the loss of the hydroxyl

196

moiety of tyrosine (in hACE2), losing a hydrogen bond with the N487 of the RBD. This

197

Y83F mutation has been reported to inhibit interaction with SARS-CoV spike RBD[39].

198

Another noticeable substitution occurs at the highly conserved K353, which is replaced by

199

histidine in both mouse and rat ACE2 (Figure 2). The K353H substitution eliminated

200

hydrogen bonds with N501 of RBD, exerting a significiant impact on RBD binding.

horse, rat, and pig. The sequence conservation, molecular interactions are correlated to

215

experimental results (Table 3), providing insights on the interactions at molecular levels.

Conclusions

222

Sequence, structure, and dynamics are analyzed for 16 ACE2 proteins in complex with the

223

RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The ACE2 of bovine and sheep exhibit high sequence

224

identities to human ACE2. MD simulations reveals that bovine, cat and panda ACE2 proteins

225

show strong binding interactions with the RBD. ACE2 of dog, siberian tiger, malayan

226

pangolin, rabbit, sheep and rabbit show relatively weaker interactions. This study provides a

227

molecular basis for differential interactions between ACE2 and RBD in 16 mammals and will

228

be useful in predicting the host range of the SARS-CoV-2.
