Abstract
A breakdown in vascular integrity and excessive inflammation are hallmarks of serious
pathological conditions including sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDs) and most
recently, severe COVID-19. FK506 – binding protein like (FKBPL) is a member of the
immunophilin protein superfamily with potent anti-tumor activity through inhibition of
angiogenesis and cancer stemness. An FKBPL-based 23mer peptide, ALM201, displayed a good
safety and pharmacokinetic profile in a Phase 1a oncology clinical trial and was subsequently
designated orphan drug status by the FDA in ovarian cancer. Here we describe a novel role for
FKBPL and its peptides in regulating vascular integrity and cytokine production though
modulating NF-κB signaling. FKBPL knockdown promoted endothelial cell barrier permeability,
which was further exacerbated upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and accompanied
by increased expression of TNF mRNA and phosphorylation of p65(RelA). Whilst treatment with
the FKBPL based pre-clinical peptide, AD-01, increased VE-cadherin endothelial tight junctions
following LPS stimulation. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from FKBPL
haploinsufficient mice (Fkbpl+/-) also demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p65(RelA) in
response to LPS stimulation compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, treatment with AD-01
inhibited p65(RelA) phosphorylation following LPS stimulation resulting in reduced NF-κB target
gene expression and proinflammatory cytokine production. In an in vivo LPS survival model,
Fkbpl+/- mice have reduced survival compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment of wildtype mice with the clinical FKBPL-based peptide, ALM201, following LPS injection resulted in a
100% survival rate in mice at experimental endpoint, as well as an abrogation of production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL-6, in peritoneal lavage washings. Analysis of human
genetic biobanks found an association between common genetic variants associated with FKBPL

and traits associated with inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and high
lymphocyte count. In summary, for the first time, we describe a novel role for FKBPL as a
regulator of inflammation and vascular integrity through modulating NF-κB signaling and FKBPL
based therapies demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory activity.

Introduction
Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), influenza and, most recently, COVID-19 can
progress to systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (1, 2). SIRS develops when the
initial, appropriate innate immune responses become amplified and then dysregulated (3). High
levels of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) mediators, such as lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or viral RNA, results in a large increase in systemic inflammatory mediators which then
contributes to organ failure (2, 4). In addition, endothelial barrier integrity is disrupted in SIRS
causing extravascular fluid leakage, disseminated intravascular coagulation and septic shock (2,
3). Enhanced vascular permeability and systemic inflammation are also the hallmarks of many
chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid
arthritis (5–7). We hypothesize that strategic targeting of both vascular permeability and systemic
inflammation has potential benefits on survival and quality of life in both acute and chronic
inflammatory syndromes.
The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) family of inducible transcription factors are master regulators of
immune responses (8). Upon activation of the canonical signaling pathway, a multi-subunit IκB
kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylates IκBα at two N-terminal serines and, thereby, triggers
ubiquitin-dependent IκBα in the proteasome resulting in rapid and transient nuclear translocation
of canonical NF-κB members, predominately p50/RelA(p65) dimers (8). This results in the
expression of proinflammatory genes, the activation of the inflammasome and loss of vascular
integrity in endothelial cells (8–11). Unselective pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB, across cell
types, results in multiple adverse effects; a major hindrance in drug development (12). The nuclear
translocation of NF-κB dimers is dependent upon a dynein/dynactin motor – immunophilin
complex, indicating that immunophilins can fine tune the signaling cascade (13, 14). Therefore,

non-direct modulation of NF-κB signaling through modulating immunophilins may be a less toxic
therapeutic target.
Immunophilins are a highly conserved intracellular protein superfamily best known for their role
in binding the immunosuppressive drugs, FK506 (tacrolimus), rapamycin (sirolimus) and
cyclosporine A (CsA) and they consist of three main groups; cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins
(FKBPs) and parvulins (15). A key feature of the family is the presence of functional and nonfunctional peptidyl prolyl isomerases (PPIase) domains which have cis-trans isomerization activity
at the X-Pro peptide bond (16). The members of the FKBP family containing tetratricopeptide
repeat (TPR) domains, FKBP51 and FKB52, exhibit opposing inhibitory and stimulatory activity
on NF-κB signaling through interactions with the p65 complex (17). The immunophilin, FK506binding protein like (FKBPL), is a divergent member of the FKBP family and was first identified
by screening for genes involved in the radiation response (18, 19). FKBPL also contains three TPR
domains in the C terminal region, important for interactions with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90),
and a non-functional PPIase domain at the N terminal (20). In a complex with Hsp90, FKBPL
stabilizes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, and complexes with the estrogen receptor
(ER), androgen receptor and glucocorticoid receptor (21–24). In addition, FKBPL is a secreted
anti-angiogenic protein and the cell surface receptor, CD44, is a potential target for its activity by
binding to the N terminal region of FKBPL (25, 26). In support of a role for FKBPL in
angiogenesis, FKBPL knockout mice are embryonically lethal and FKBPL haploinsufficient
(Fkbpl+/-) embryos display vascular irregularities, suggesting a critical role for FKBPL in
developmental angiogenesis (27). In the cancer setting, FKBPL also demonstrated dual antiangiogenic and anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity (28–31). Indeed, high intra-tumor FKBPL
levels are a marker of improved prognosis in breast and ovarian cancer (32, 33). In vitro and in

vivo knockdown of FKBPL expands the CSC subpopulation by increasing expression of the
pluripotency transcription factors (NANOG, OCT4, SOX2) (29). Notably, an increase in NFKBP1,
which encodes for the p105 NF-κB pre cursor subunit, was also observed when FKBPL was
knocked down in ovarian cancer (33). The highly potent anti-angiogenic and anti-CSC activity of
FKBPL is due to a unique sequence within the N-terminal region, independent of the TPR domains
(34). A 24-residue peptide, AD-01, comprising amino acids 34–58 of FKBPL was developed
demonstrating potent anti-tumor activity and a more stable 23-residue peptide, ALM201, was
selected as the clinical drug candidate. ALM201 elicited equipotent activity to AD-01 (33, 35).
ALM201 lacked cytotoxicity and displayed an excellent safety profile in a Phase 1a, first-in-man,
dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with ovarian cancer and other solid tumors (EudraCT
number: 2014-001175-31) and was subsequently designated orphan drug status by the FDA in
ovarian cancer (36).
Here for the first time, we discover a novel role for FKBPL and its peptide derivatives in the
regulation of inflammation via modulation of NF-κB signaling. In macrophages, FKBPL regulates
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in endothelial cells, FKBPL has a role in maintaining
vascular integrity in response to inflammation. Moreover, FKBPL based peptides, previously
shown to be safe in humans, have potent anti-inflammatory activity and abrogate LPS lethality in
in vivo models. Finally, we demonstrate that genetic variation in human FKBPL is associated with
chronic inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, supporting a protective
role for this protein in pathological conditions associated with inflammation.

Belfast. The CD44-/- mice (37) where housed and bred at the University of British Columbia as
approved by the University Animal Care Committee in accordance with the Canadian Council of
Animal Care guidelines for ethical animal research (A15-213, A19-159). All animal experiments
were approved by the Health Products Research Authority or UK Home Office and RCSI Research
and Ethics Committee under Project License PPL 1403 and Individual license numbers IAN I181
and IAN I193. Experiments were carried out in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU.
Bone marrow derived macrophages
Bone marrow was removed from the femur and tibia bone by inserting the top of a syringe into the
orifice of the bone and flushing with PBS. The extracted bone marrow was resuspended in red
blood cell lysis buffer (Sigma, Ireland) and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. PBS was
added to stop the reaction and cells were resuspended in differentiation media (DMEM with 10%
(v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin and M-CSF (20% (v/v) L929 mouse fibroblast
supernatant). Cells were then strained through a 70 μm filter and plated on petri dishes and
incubated in 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2 for 6 days, with media changed
on day 3. Cells were then plated for experiments at a concentration of 5 x 105 cells per ml in
complete DMEM media on tissue culture plates for 24 h and treatments added as described.
siFKBPL transfection
HMEC-1 cells were grown until 80% confluence in a 6 well plate and then transfected using 100
nM ON TARGETplus SMARTpool siFKBPL (Horizon Discovery, UK) or siNon-targeted
negative control (Horizon Discovery, UK) and Lipofectamine (10 μl/well) (Invitrogen, UK) in
Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen, Ireland). Cells were incubated at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% O2/5% CO2, for 8 h. Cells were seeded in Transwell support inserts

X-CELLigence plates for in vitro endothelial barrier assays or cultured for a further 24 h and for
gene expression analysis or 72 h for protein expression analysis in complete media.
In vitro Evan’s blue permeability assay
Endothelial cell barrier permeability was determined as described previously (38), with minor
modifications. Transfected HMEC-1 cells (2.5 x 105 cells/ml in complete media) were seeded for
72 h on polycarbonate membrane Transwell permeable inserts (Costar, 3 μm pore size, 12 mm
diameter, Sigma Ireland) and incubated for three days. Fresh growth media was added to the
bottom chambers, and media was removed from the top chamber and replaced with 0.67 mg/ml
Evans Blue (Sigma, Ireland) with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, Ireland) for 10 min. A
change in endothelial cell barrier permeability was determined by assessment of the increase in
absorbance at 650 nm in the bottom chamber due to Evans Blue-BSA permeating the endothelial
cell layer. Experiments were performed and permeability (percentage) was determined compared
to untreated cells.
In vivo Evan’s blue (Miles Assay)
A 0.5% sterile solution of Evans blue (Sigma, Ireland) was prepared in PBS and 200 μl slowly
injected into the tail vein of mice. After 30 min the mice were sacrificed through cervical
dislocation and organs collected and weighed. 500 μl formamide (Sigma, Ireland) was added to
the organs and heated to 55°C in a heat block for 24 h. The formamide/Evan’s blue mixture was
centrifuged to pellet any tissue and the supernatant measured at 610 nm, using formamide as a
blank. The amount of Evan’s blue extravasated per mg of tissue was then calculated as outlined
in (39).

Using the X-CELLigence system (Roche, Welwyn Garden City, UK) to assess impedance, 3 × 104
HMEC-1 cells were seeded into an E-16 multi-well plate (Roche) in triplicate and incubated for
72 h. LPS (Sigma, Ireland) and/or AD-01 (100 nM) was added to the relevant wells. Impedance
measurements were taken at 10 min intervals and cell index normalized to the point immediately
prior to addition of LPS (1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml) and PBS or AD-01 (1 nM and 100 nM).
Immunofluorescence
3 x 105 HMEC-1 cells/well were seeded in a 6-well plate with inserted glass cover slips fixed using
nail varnish. Cells were incubated for 24 h and then sheared at 10 dyn/cm2 for a further 24 h. LPS
(10 μg/ml) and AD-01 (100 nM) was added to the cells under shear conditions for 2 h. The cells
were fixed for 10 min using 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature and washed twice with
PBS for 10 min. Triton 0.01% in PBS was added for 20 min and cells washed twice with PBS for
10 min. A blocking solution of 1% BSA in PBS was added for 1 h at room temperature. Anti VE
cadherin was added (sc-9989, Santa Cruz, USA) in a 1:50 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at
room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS twice for 10 min. A 1:1000 dilution of anti-mouse
Alexa 488 (Invitrogen, Ireland) was added for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were washed
twice for 10 min with PBS and a cover slip was mounted to a glass slide with a mounting solution
containing DAPI (Abcam). Cells were visualized using confocal microscopy and VE cadherin
surface expression quantified using ImageJ 1x (Image J, NIH)
Inflammasome activation
Differentiated BMDM were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) and incubated for 3 h. The media was
then removed and PBS or AD-01 (1 nM) was then added for 1 h in serum free media. To induce
IL-1β cleavage, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (5 μM, Invivogen, USA) was added for 45 min.

Supernatants were collected and cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and analyzed by Western blot or
ELISA, as described.
Real-time PCR
Cells were washed with PBS followed by lysis and homogenization with 1 ml of TRIZOL (SigmaAldrich, Ireland) per 10 cm2 culture and RNA extracted as per manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
concentration and purity were determined by 260λ/280λ and 260λ/280λ ratios respectively. cDNA
was synthesized from 100 ng-200 ng of RNA using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Ireland) in a thermocyler. Gene expression was determined by quantitative reverse transcription
PCR (qPCR). Gene specific primers (Table 1; IDT, USA) were diluted 1/10 from stock 100 μM
concentrations and PCR reaction was completed using a 7500 real time PCR system
(ThermoFisher, USA) and Sybr Green (Invitrogen, Ireland). Changes in expression of genes of
interest from untreated cells, or treatments were quantified by fold change-ΔΔCT from
housekeeping genes β-Actin and GADPH (2–∆∆Ct).

and stained on ice for 30 min (Table 3) and gated as outlined in Supplementary Figure 2.
Compensation was determined by single staining alone and no positive staining detected from IgG

gene, and whether variants found in fkbpl, fkbp51 and fkbp52 were associated with phenotypes of
interest (tumor, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases). A list of phenotypes which met the
traditional genome-wide association study (GWAS) significance threshold of p<= 5x10-8 was
compiled. The information obtained included the log fold change, average expression, P value and
adjusted P value for each series (Supplementary Table 1).
The effect of genetic variation in FKBPL on tissue-specific gene expression levels was tested using
the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database (GTEx Consortium, 2014: PMID 23715323).
Known variants in fkbpl were queried in the GTEx database, and any variants which were
significantly associated (p<=5x10-8) with altered gene expression levels in a given tissue had their
normalized expression levels (NES) in that tissue noted.

To investigate a link between fkbpl gene expression and psoriasis a search was performed on the
NCBI GEO database to obtain mRNA microarray results and identified GSE14905 from skin
biopsy samples (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) which compared a non-disease
control cohort and a diseased cohort. The dataset was downloaded from the NCBI GEO webpage
via the R Studio program, and clinical data extracted to create .CEL files containing the study
information. Using the Bioconductor Array Quality Metrics package on R Studio, quality control
was undertaken for each data series. Fkbpl was defined as the gene of interest and using probe set
219187_at, each dataset was statistically analyzed to compare the expression of this gene in the
control and diseased groups. Each boxplot showed the FKBPL gene expression profile of the two
groups under investigation and any outliers in the analysis.

Results
FKBPL is a novel regulator of LPS-induced endothelial permeability
Previous studies investigating the vasculature in Fkbpl+/- mice noted that they displayed enhanced
angiogenesis with an associated increase in the number of erythrocytes leaking into surrounding
tissues compared to wild-type mice (26). Therefore we hypothesized that FKBPL may be a novel
regulator of vascular permeability. FKBPL knockdown, using siRNA transfection, resulted in ~
80% reduction in both mRNA and protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells
(HMEC-1); LPS stimulation did not affect the reduction in FKBPL mRNA or protein expression
following transfection (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 3A). Next, we investigated if FKBPL
regulated endothelial permeability using in vitro and in vivo Evan’s blue permeability assays.
When FKBPL was knocked down in HMEC-1 cells there was an increase in barrier permeability
compared to non-targeted control cells (Fig 1 B, p = 0.0347, n=3). We then investigated if Fkbpl+/mice also displayed enhanced blood vessel permeability. Evan’s blue dye was injected
intravenously and the dye was extracted from major organs. There was a significant increase in
permeability in the skin of the FKBPL deficient mice (Fig. 1C. p=0.001378, n=3) which was
visible externally (Fig. 1D). Endothelial barrier dysfunction occurs during stimulation by
inflammatory agents or in inflammation-related disease states (40) and therefore we investigated
if FKBPL had a role regulating LPS-induced endothelial permeability by utilizing the XCELLigence system to measure cell impedence (41). Increasing doses of LPS resulted in a greater
decrease in HMEC-1 cell impedance (Supplementary Fig. 3B) without affecting cell viability
(Supplementary Fig. 3C). Real-time analysis demonstrated that FKBPL knockdown resulted in
decreased impedance in HMEC-1s (Fig. 1E, F p=0.025, n=3) and this was further enhanced by
LPS treatment (Fig 1E, F. p=0.0249, n=3). Analysis of gene expression showed that there was no

change in the levels of the endothelial adhesion marker, VE cadherin, when FKBPL was knocked
down (Fig. 1G). However, there was a significant upregulation of TNF following LPS stimulation
and this was approximately three-fold higher when FKBPL was knocked down in the HMEC-1
cells (Fig. 1H, p=0.025, n=3). In addition, TNF mRNA was also increased three fold in
unstimulated FKBPL-knockdown HMEC-1 cells compared to non-targeted controls (Fig. 1H;
p<0.001, n=3). TNF upregulation is associated with activation of NF-κB activation and therefore
we assessed phosphorylation of p65 in HMEC-1 cells following FKBPL knockdown. Indeed, we
observed increased phosphorylation of p65 when FKBPL was knocked down in HMEC-1 cells
following LPS stimulation (Fig. 1 I). Stimulation of FKBPL knockdown HMEC-1 cells with LPS
resulted in a significant increase in the phosphorylation of p65 compared to non-targeted (NT)
control cells at 90 min post treatment (Fig. 1 I; p=0.0367, n=3).

FKBPL based peptide, AD-01, abrogates LPS induced endothelial permeability
The FKBPL-based peptide, AD-01, has previously shown potent anti-angiogenic activity and
therefore we assessed the ability of AD-01 to regulate endothelial permeability. Utilizing the XCELLigence system, AD-01 treatment of HMEC-1 cells resulted in a small decrease in impedance,
potentially indicating a change in cell morphology as previously described (26) (Fig. 2A, B
p=0.0395). Next, we investigated if AD-01 could abrogate the decrease in cell impedance induced
by LPS treatment. There was a significant increase in cell impedance upon addition of AD-01
indicating a potential protection of the endothelial barrier (Fig. 2C,D p=0.0346). To visualize the
endothelial barrier, the HMEC-1 cells were sheared for 24 h before addition of LPS/AD-01 and
then fixed and stained for VE-cadherin tight junctions. As expected, LPS induced a breakdown of
VE cadherin junctions and this was abrogated in the presence of AD-01 (Fig. 2F, p<0.0001). There

was no change in the gene expression of VE cadherin in HMEC-1 cells following LPS/AD-01
treatment suggesting that AD-01 caused a redistribution of VE cadherin at the cell surface (Fig.
1G).

FKBPL and its pre-clinical peptide, AD-01, decrease phosphorylation of p65 following LPS
stimulation in macrophages by a non CD44-dependent mechanism
NF-κB signaling is crucial for the inflammatory response by innate immune cells and therefore we
investigated if FKBPL could also regulate activation of NF-κB activation in macrophages (42).
BMDMs from wild-type and Fkbpl+/- mice were isolated and stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml).
Similar to microvascular endothelial cells, Fkbpl+/- BMDMs exhibited increased phosphorylation
of p65 following LPS stimulation (Fig. 3A, 60 min p=0.037, n=3). Next wild-type BMDMs were
stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) ± AD-01 (1 nM). The addition of AD-01 abrogated
phosphorylation of p65 following LPS stimulation in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3B 45 min p =
0.0426; 60 min p=0.003; n=3). FKBPL and AD-01 have been shown to exert anti-angiogenic
activity through the cell surface receptor CD44 (26). To investigate if the ability of AD-01 to
regulate NF-κB signaling is dependent upon CD44, we used a CD44 knockout mouse model.
BMDMs were extracted from CD44 knockout mice (CD44-/-) and stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml)
± AD-01 (1 nM). AD-01 also abrogated phosphorylation of p65 in CD44-/- BMDMs, thus
indicating that FKBPL regulates NF-κB activation independently of CD44 (Fig. 3C 90 min p=
0.0295; n=3). LPS can also activate other intracellular signaling events downstream of Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) including the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (43). However, AD-01
did not modulate phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 3D).

FKBPL based peptide, AD-01, decreases gene expression and secretion of proinflammatory
mediators in macrophages following LPS stimulation
NF-κB activation induces the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The ability
of AD-01 to inhibit the secretion of TNF and IL-1β in BMDMs was investigated using ELISA.
BMDMs from wild-type and CD44-/- mice were stimulated for 6 h with LPS (100 ng/ml) ±AD-01
(1 nM and 100 nM) and supernatants collected. There was a significant ~ 25% decrease in TNF
secretion following AD-01 (1 nM) treatment in both the wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 4A, p=0.0387;
n=3) and CD44-/- BMDMs (Fig.4 A, p=0.0380; n=3). The production of bioactive IL-1β requires
two sequential steps involving priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Priming
entails the recognition of danger-associated molecular patterns or pathogen-associated molecular
patterns, such as LPS, by TLR4, thereby resulting in activation of NF-κB and induction of proIL1β. Subsequently NLRP3 agonists (such as ATP) results in the formation of the NLRP3
inflammasome complex and pro-IL-1β is cleaved to its mature form and secreted (44). BMDMs
were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 3 h, then PBS control or AD-01 (1 nM) were added for 1 h
in serum free media and then ATP (5 nM) for 45 min. There was a significant reduction in IL-1β
secretion in the AD-01 treated BMDMs following addition of ATP (Fig. 4B p=0.0086; n=4).
Furthermore, there was no change in expression of pro-IL1-β expression in the AD-01 treated
group following ATP, indicating that the reduction in IL-1β secretion was due to an inhibitory
effect on the NF-κB priming of the inflammasome (Fig. 4C). There was also a significant reduction
in TNF secretion in the AD-01 treated cells following addition of LPS and LPS and ATP (Fig. 4D;
LPS+AD-01 p=0.0054, LPS+ATP+AD-01 p =0.0134; n=5). The expression of NF-κB regulated
genes following treatment with LPS (100 ng/ml) and rFKBPL (50 ng/ml) or AD-01 (1nM) was
investigated using qPCR. There was a significant reduction in IL-1β expression (AD-01,

p=0.0185; n=5), COX2 (AD-01, p=0.0064 rFKBPL, p=0.0185; n=5) and IL-6 (rFKBPL,
p=0.0439; n=5) (Fig. 4E.). Similarly, in THP-1 human monocyte cell line, AD-01 (1 nM)
significantly reduced mRNA expression of tnf, Il-β, Il-18, nlrp3, nfkb1 and casp1 following 6 h
stimulation with LPS (1000 ng/ml) (Supplementary Fig. 4).
FKBPL and its clinical peptide, ALM201, are protective against LPS lethality in vivo
To investigate the protective role of FKBPL in vivo, the LPS survival model was utilized. Fkbpl+/mice had a significantly shorter survival than wild-type mice (Fig. 5A, p=0.0021, n>5 mice/group).
The clinical peptide based on FKBPL, ALM201, has enhanced stability to AD-01 and was utilized
in this in vivo model. Briefly, group 1 mice received PBS as a control, group 2 mice received LPS
(6 mg/kg), group 3 mice received ALM201 (3 mg/kg) prior to LPS and 3 more doses of ALM201
thereafter, group 4 mice received three doses of ALM201 (3 mg/kg) after LPS and group 5 mice
received three doses of dexamethasone (10 μg) (Supplementary Fig. 1A). As expected, the LPS
only group had a significant shorter survival than the PBS treated group (Fig. 5B, C; p = 0.0018,
n=5/group). Furthermore, dexamethasone significantly increased survival compared to LPS alone
(Fig. 5B, C; p=0.0044, n=5/group). Pre-treatment with ALM201 resulted in a comparable
significant increase in survival to the dexamethasone treated group (Fig. 5B, C; p=0.0342;
n=5/group). Impressively, treatment of ALM201 post LPS resulted in 100% survival (Fig. 5D;
p=0.0009, n=5/group). Analysis of cytokine concentrations following peritoneal lavage at
experimental endpoint revealed that ALM201 post treatment significantly reduced IL-6 (Fig. 5E;
p<0.0001) and TNF (Fig. 5F: p<0.0001) pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to LPS only and
significantly increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 (Fig. 5G; p=0.004). Finally, we
investigated if FKBPL and its peptide derivatives had an effect on in vivo inflammatory cell

infiltrates. Wild-type and Fkbpl+/- mice were injected with intra peritoneal LPS (6 mg/kg) and PBS
(vehicle control) or AD-01 (3 mg/kg) for 3 h and peritoneal lavage washings were collected. LPS
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in peritoneal macrophages and γδ T cells and a nonsignificant increase in neutrophils (Fig. 5H, Supplementary Figure 2B). However, there was no
significant changes in macrophages, neutrophils or γδ T cells between wild-type and Fkbpl+/- mice
or following AD-01 treatment (Fig. 5H, Supplementary Figure 2B). Furthermore, there was no
change in NK cells or T cells following LPS injection (Supplementary Fig. 2B).

In silico analysis of FKBPL and inflammatory disorders
In order to determine if genetic variations in FKBPL are linked to human traits or diseases, we
utilized data from the UK Biobank. The strongest genotype-phenotype association was a C/T
missense SNP (rs28732176) which was strongly associated with psoriasis (p=1.78 x 10-210) (Fig.
6A). In addition, the rs28732176 variant was also significantly associated with rheumatoid arthritis
(p= 5.58 x 10-8) (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, an A/G variant in the 5’ untranslated region of FKBPL
(rs204892) was significantly associated with rheumatoid arthritis (p=7.84 x 10-11) as well as hay
fever rhinitis or eczema (p=5.29 x 10

-13

) (Fig. 6A). Finally, a G/C missense variant SNP

(rs35580488) was associated with lymphocyte count (p=1.48x10-11) (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, this
variant is within the region of the FKBPL-based therapeutic peptides, AD-01 and ALM201, and
this allele frequency is associated with approximately 1% of the population (Fig. 6B). As FKBPL
shares similar homology to FKBP51 and FKBP52, particularly in the TPR domains, we also
investigated if similar traits were associated with FKBP51 and FKBP52. FKBP51 had several
variants associated with lymphocyte count but neither FKBP51 nor FKBP52 were associated with
psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis or any other disease with an inflammatory component

(Supplementary Table 1). We used molecular modelling to predict any potential changes in
structure from the missense SNPs, rs28732176 and rs35580488 using the Robetta server (45). The
corresponding mutations, A90T and T46R/M could potentially influence the conformational
flexibility of the PPIase domain and impact interactions with various cellular binding partners (Fig.
6C). Next, we investigated if reported SNPs in fkbpl had any predicted effect on gene expression.
Indeed, rs28732176 (associated with psoriasis) is predicted to reduce fkbpl gene expression in both
sun exposed, lower leg skin (Supplementary Table 2; NES = -0.24; p = 1.3x10-13) and non-sun
exposed suprapubic skin (Supplementary Table 2; NES = - 0.32; p= 1.8x10-12). Predicted gene
changes associated with rs35580488 and rs204892 are presented in Supplementary Table 3 and 4.
We then utilized the publicly available gene expression data series GSE14905 to further investigate
fkbpl expression in psoriasis. fkbpl gene expression was downregulated in the lesional samples of
psoriasis patients compared to healthy skin biopsies (Fig. 6C; p=3.19x10-13). Furthermore, fkbpl
expression was also decreased in the lesional skin compared to the non lesional skin within
diseased patients (Fig 6D; p=7.86x10-15).

Discussion
Here, for the first time, we describe a novel role for FKBPL as a negative regulator of NF-κB
activation. Peptides based on the N terminal region of FKBPL prevent activation of NF-κB
following LPS stimulation resulting in promotion of tight junctions in endothelial cells (Fig. 2)
and decreased phosphorylation of p65 and cytokine release from macrophages (Fig. 3,4).
Impressively, the clinical FKBPL peptide, ALM201, also abrogated LPS induced death in vivo
(Fig. 5); whilst Fkbpl+/- mice demonstrated reduced survival to LPS. NF-κB has long been an
attractive drug target for inflammation, however, the toxicity associated with indiscriminate
blockade of NF-κB signaling has hindered clinical development (12, 46). ALM201 has completed
a Phase 1a dose escalation clinical trial in the cancer setting and encouragingly, ALM201 had a
favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile, with no major adverse events noted (33). This study
describes novel indications for FKBPL based therapeutics as anti-inflammatory agents via
modulation of NF-κB signaling in endothelial cells and macrophages.
We had previously observed that Fkbpl+/- mice appeared to have less robust blood vessels
compared to wild-type mice, despite enhanced angiogenesis (27). Indeed, here we demonstrate,
using in vitro and in vivo Evan’s blue-based vascular permeability assays, that knockdown of
FKBPL in endothelial cells decreases vascular integrity (Fig. 1). A reduction in VE-cadherin at
endothelial cell junctions induced by pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines and LPS, results
in increased permeability allowing inflammatory cells to migrate from the blood to tissues, as well
as, exposure of the basement membrane and activation of the clotting cascade (47, 48). We show
that addition of LPS to endothelial cells deficient in FKBPL results in enhanced LPS induced
endothelial permeability (Fig. 1E, F) coupled with enhanced tnf gene expression (Fig. 1H) and
increased phosphorylation of p65 (Fig. 1I). However, addition of AD-01 to LPS stimulated

microvascular endothelial cells partially abrogated the decrease in impedence (Fig. 2) and
enhanced VE cadherin at endothelial cell junctions (Fig. 2); which would be advantageous in some
proinflammatory disease settings. FKBP51, another member of the FKBP protein family with TPR
domains, has also been associated with regulation of endothelial barrier permeability, although it
has not been established if FKBP51 can protect the endothelial under inflammatory conditions (49,
50). The underlying basic mechanisms of vascular integrity remain incompletely understood and
to date this is the first report of an FKBP protein regulating endothelial permeability during the
inflammatory response.
Next we investigated if FKBPL also had a role in modulating NF-κB signaling in macrophages.
BMDMs derived from Fkbpl+/- mice exhibited enhanced phosphorylation of p65 compared to
wild-type BMDMs when stimulated with LPS (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, treatment with AD-01
inhibited phosphorylation of p65 in wild-type BMDMs stimulated with LPS (Fig. 3B). AD-01 has
previously been shown to require the cell surface receptor CD44 to inhibit angiogenesis and we
hypothesized that CD44 may be involved in AD-01’s anti-inflammatory activity (26). LPS signals
through TLR4, and CD44 has been shown to associate with TLR4 in macrophages and down
regulate its signaling (51–53). Treatment with AD-01 also inhibited the phosphorylation of p65
and reduced secretion of TNF in the CD44-/- BMDMs, indicating that CD44 is not required for
FKBPL to modulate NF-κB signaling (Fig. 3C, 4A). Other members of the FKBP protein family
with a similar structure to FKBPL have been shown to regulate NF-κB signaling (17). There is
good sequence conservation between FKBPL and FKBP51 and FKBP52 in terms of both quantity
and configuration of the TPR domains, whilst there is weak conservation in the N terminal regions
which contains functional or non-functional PPIase domains of FKBPL, FKBP51 and FKBP52
(20). FKBP51 complexes with cytoplasmic p65 in unstimulated cells, and upon stimulation,

FKBP51 is exchanged for FKBP52 and FKBP52 is then recruited to the promoter region of NFκB genes (14, 17). The TPR domains of FKBP51 and FKBP52 are not required for the regulation
of NF-κB signaling whilst the PPIase activity of FKBP52 is required for its NF-κB stimulatory
activity, whereas the PPIase activity is not required for FKBP51 inhibitory action (14, 17).
Similarly, FKBPL peptides AD-01 and ALM201 are based on the N terminal region of FKBPL
which contains the non-functional PPIase domain (20). As AD-01 has similar activity to
recombinant full length FKBPL in regulating NF-κB target genes, it is likely this is also the domain
in FKBPL that is important for modulation of NK-κB (Fig. 4E). Further work is required to
understand the intricate relationships between FKBPL, FKBPL51 and FKBP52 in the modulation
of NF-κB signaling.
The data presented in this manuscript indicates that FKBPL-based therapeutics have potential
utility as dual vascular stabilization and anti-inflammatory agents in a wide range of disorders.
Decreased vascular integrity is a hallmark of serious pathological conditions and there are
currently no therapies for stabilizing the vasculature (54–58). In addition, the systemic
inflammatory response and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines further perpetuates the
multiple organ dysfunction experienced in these patients (59). Although the use of glucocorticoids
in sepsis is not conclusive, the RECOVERY trial showed dexamethasone treatment resulted in
lower mortality in COVID patients receiving respiratory support (60, 61). Notably, in the in vivo
LPS survival model, ALM201 therapy demonstrated enhanced survival compared to
dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 5C), potentially indicating more potent activity. Considering that
FKBPL based peptides have already been shown to be non-toxic in clinical and preclinical studies,
this data indicates they may be repurposed as much needed therapeutics for these clinical
indications with minimal risk of adverse effects.

Finally, we conducted in silco analysis for phenotypic traits associated with SNPs in FKBPL.
Several SNPs in FKBPL were identified and associated with chronic diseases with autoimmune
and endothelial dysfunction pathogenic traits. Psoriasis is a skin disease with a worldwide
prevalence of 2% and it has a strong genetic predisposition (62). A missense SNP in FKBPL
displayed a very strong association with psoriasis and furthermore, FKBPL gene expression was
significantly downregulated in psoriatic skin lesions compared to non-lesional skin (Fig. 6). Antiinflammatory biological therapies have shown good clinical efficacy in psoriasis patients.
However, in some cases an initial clinical response is short lived and therapy resistance develops
(62, 63). In addition to enhanced inflammation, the pathophysiology of psoriasis shows a strong
pro-angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction component (6, 64). Therefore, FKBPL based
therapies could potentially have a therapeutic advantage by dual-targeting the dysfunctional
vasculature as well as the inflammatory component of psoriasis lesions. Similarly, SNPs in FKBPL
were associated with rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 6), another chronic autoimmune disorder associated
with both aberrant angiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation and FKBPL may be a
novel therapeutic that could be harnessed in this setting (65, 66). Of particular note is rs28732176,
a missense mutation, associated with both psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis (Fig. 6A).
Interestingly it is within the region of FKBPL where the anti-inflammatory peptides, AD-01 and
ALM201 are based and this variant is prevalent in an estimated 1% of the population (Fig. 6B).
In summary, for the first time we have shown that FKBPL is a novel regulator of endothelial
permeability and pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling in response to inflammation. Furthermore,
FKBPL-based peptides are potent inhibitors of endothelial barrier dysfunction and inflammatory
cytokine signaling through modulation of NF-κB signaling using in vitro and in vivo models. We
have also demonstrated that SNPs in FKBPL are associated with inflammatory conditions and

Figure 6 Single nucleotide polymorphisms in FKBPL are associated with auto-inflammatory
disorders
(A) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in FKBPL is associated with autoimmune disorders
in the UK biobank dataset. (B) Frequency of identified SNPs in the general population within the
UK biobank cohort. (C) A computational 3D-model of FKBPL, built based on FKBP51 using the
Robetta server. The PPIase and TPR domains of FKBPL are shown in orange and blue. The
ALM201 peptide is highlighted in green. Residues Ala90 and Thr46 that have mutations associated
with inflammatory disorders are shown in a space-filling model. (D) Box plot comparing fkbpl
gene expression in the normal skin biopsies of control samples and the psoriasis lesional skin
biopsies of diseases samples in the GSE14905 dataset. (E) Box plot comparing FKBPL gene
expression in the non-lesional and lesional skin biopsies of psoriasis patients in the GSE14905
dataset.

A) Flow cytometry gating strategy of immune cell analysis from peritoneal lavage washings
collected from wild-type mice treated with PBS, LPS 6 mg/kg and AD-01 3 mg/kg (post LPS) and
Fkbpl+/- mice treated with LPS 6 mg/ml after 3 h. (B) Percentage of natural killer cells, γδ T cells,
T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells in peritoneal lavage washings. Data points are mean ± SEM.

Supplementary Figure 3
(A) FKBPL knockdown in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1s) using a siFKBPL
and non targeted (NT) control in untreated and LPS (10μg/ml) stimulation conditions. Protein
FKBPL expression was analyzed by western blot and protein expression was quantified using
ImageJ, adjusted to αβ tubulin and normalized to control. (B) Cell impedance was measured in
HMEC-1s treated with PBS (control) or LPS (1 and 10 μg/ml) using the X-CELLigence system.
HMEC-1 cell index for each condition was normalized to PBS control at 24 h. (C) Cell viability
of HMEC-1s treated with PBS (control) or LPS (1 and 10 μg/ml) for 24 h was measured using
MTT assay. Data points are mean ± SEM. n ≥ 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***p < 0.01 (one way
ANOVA).
Supplementary Figure 4
The THP-1 human monocytic cell line was treated with LPS (1000 ng/ml) and AD-01 (1 nM) for
6 h. RNA was extracted and gene expression analysis conducted by qPCR. Data points are
mean ± SEM. n ≥ 3. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, ***p < 0.01 (one way ANOVA).
