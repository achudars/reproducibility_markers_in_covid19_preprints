Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a linear single-stranded, positive-sense RNA
genome of ~30 kb, whose outbreak caused the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The
ability of coronaviruses to rapidly evolve, adapt, and cross species barriers makes the
development of effective and durable therapeutic strategies a challenging and urgent
need. As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial
roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of
functionally conserved structural elements within coronavirus RNA genomes have been
identified to date.
Here, we performed RNA structure probing by SHAPE-MaP to obtain a single-base
resolution secondary structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome. The
SHAPE-MaP probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA
elements (5′ UTR, ribosomal frameshifting element, and 3′ UTR), and reveal new
structures. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of highly-structured regions
across the SARS-CoV-2 genome allowed for the identification of several putative
druggable pockets. Furthermore, ~8% of the identified structure elements show
significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their
functionally-conserved role. In addition, we identify a set of persistently single-stranded
regions having high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense
oligonucleotide therapeutics.
Collectively, our work lays the foundation for the development of innovative RNA-targeted
therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-related infections.

Introduction
RNA viruses encode the information needed to take control of the host cell on two levels
(Boerneke et al., 2019). On one hand, the linear sequence of their RNA genomes encodes
for all the proteins needed to take over the host cell machinery and to assemble new viral
particles. On the other hand, their single-stranded RNA genome folds back on itself to
form intricate secondary and tertiary structures that have been proven essential for viral
replication, protein synthesis, packaging, immune system evasion, and more. RNA
viruses, that are responsible for numerous deadly diseases (e.g. AIDS, Hepatitis C,
SARS, Dengue, and Ebola), are characterized by higher mutation rates compared to DNA
viruses, enabling them to rapidly evolve and adapt (Sanjuán et al., 2010). As a
consequence of their high mutation rates, RNA viruses can rapidly develop resistance
towards drugs and vaccines by slightly altering their core proteins (Irwin et al., 2016). In
contrast, certain RNA structures formed in the context of viral RNA genomes are well
conserved (Boerneke et al., 2019), in spite of changes in the underlying encoded amino
acid sequence, making them valuable therapeutic targets.
Coronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, members of the
Coronaviridae family (Cui et al., 2018). This family consists of four genera, of which two
(alpha and beta) can only infect mammals, while the other two (gamma and delta) mostly
infect birds, although some of them can also infect mammals. These viruses were not
anticipated to be highly pathogenic in humans until the outbreak of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 (Wit et al., 2016). Since then, two
other major outbreaks of coronaviruses occurred, one by the Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and recently by the new SARS-related
coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV) at the end of 2019 (Zhou et al.,
2020). The latter, still ongoing at the time of writing this article, rapidly resulted in a
pandemic, with (to date) nearly 8 million people infected and over 400,000 deaths across
the world. The ability to evolve inside different reservoirs and to cross species barriers,
infecting humans with high morbidity and mortality, makes this genus a recurrent potential
threat for worldwide public health. Indeed, certain SARS-CoV-like viruses from bats have

been previously shown to be able to infect human cells without the need for any prior
adaptation; thus, suggesting that SARS-related outbreaks can potentially re-emerge at
any time (Wit et al., 2016).
In light of these considerations, identifying new therapeutically-relevant and durable
druggable targets for the treatment of coronavirus infections constitutes a key and highlytimely need. In this perspective, RNA structural elements represent attractive targets for
drug discovery. Indeed, inhibition of viral replication by RNA-targeting small molecule
drugs has already been proven to be feasible for other RNA viruses, such as the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), SARS-CoV, and influenza A virus
(IAV; (Hermann, 2016). Additionally, the identification of highly-conserved weakly
structured regions within viral RNA genomes might aid the design of oligonucleotidebases antiviral therapeutics.
Coronaviruses bear the largest genomes among RNA viruses, ranging from
approximately 26 to 32 kb. A handful of functional cis-regulatory RNA structural elements
have been previously identified by phylogenetic analyses and these include structures in
the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) and the ribosomal frameshifting element (FSE;
(Madhugiri et al., 2016, 2018; Yang and Leibowitz, 2015). In the 5′ UTR of most
betacoronaviruses (Beta-CoV), several stem-loops (SL1-5) involved in mediating viral
replication have been identified. The ORF1a-ORF1b boundary hosts the frameshifting
element (FSE; (Brierley et al., 1989). This pseudoknotted structure is pivotal for the
programmed ribosomal frameshifting, that allows the translation of the ORF1ab
polyprotein. A second putative pseudoknot has been proposed to be located in the 3′ UTR
(Goebel et al., 2003; Stammler et al., 2011), that includes an extremely conserved
octanucleotide within the hypervariable region (HVR; (Goebel et al., 2006), and the stemloop-like 2 motif (s2m; (Robertson et al., 2004).
Sharing over 79.6% sequence identity to the genome of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2020),
SARS-CoV-2 has been predicted to harbor these typical RNA structure elements
(Rangan et al., 2020). However, the structural complexity of SARS-CoV-2 and other Beta-

CoV genomes has remained largely unexplored so far, probably because of the
challenges connected with the structural analysis of RNA molecules of such a big size.
Deep comprehension of the structural architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome is
crucial to identify new key (un)structured elements for the development of innovative
therapeutic approaches.
To address this need, in this work we provide the first experimental characterization of
the full-length genome of a coronavirus by SHAPE mutational profiling (SHAPE-MaP)
analysis (Siegfried et al., 2014), using the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus as a model. After
modeling the secondary structure of the entire RNA genome, we identified a subset of
regions showing a low propensity towards folding, ideal for the design of antisense
oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics, as well as a set of stably folded RNA structures, of
which at least ~8% are under selective pressure and show significant covariation. By
coupling secondary structure constraints and coarse-grained 3D modeling, we then infer
the 3D structure of these elements and identify the most suitable for accommodating the
interaction with small molecule drugs. Collectively, our work provides the cornerstone for
the development of RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-related infections.

Results and Discussion
To determine the secondary structure landscape of SARS-CoV-2, we devised a multiplex
PCR strategy (see Methods) to perform the targeted SHAPE mutational profiling (SHAPEMaP) analysis of the entire viral genome (~30 kb). First, we performed in vitro refolding
of total RNA from Vero E6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, followed by probing with 2methylnicotinic acid imidazolide (NAI; Figure 1A). This approach has a considerable
advantage, compared to in vitro transcription, of allowing the analysis of high amounts of
full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, bearing post-transcriptional RNA modifications that could
occur in vivo during natural infection, and that might affect local RNA folding.
We designed a set of 70 primer pairs, divided into two terminally-overlapping subsets
(odd and even), to perform the targeted SHAPE-MaP analysis in ~500 bp tiles. The
terminal overlap between the two sets was introduced to query those bases that would
otherwise be blind to SHAPE-MaP analysis because of primer binding. Following the
equimolar pooling of amplicons and fragmentation, DNA libraries from two biological
replicates of SHAPE-probed RNA were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina platform.
The mutational signature for the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome was then obtained by
merging the odd and even sets, after computationally masking the respective primerpairing regions. Correlation of replicates was very high (p = 0.97 for both odd and even
set on raw mutation frequencies; p = 0.99 genome-wide after normalization; Figure 1B
and Figure S1). Given this, we combined both replicates for secondary structure
modeling.
Overall, we sequenced over 30 million high-quality reads per replicate, of which >99%
were successfully aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome, resulting in a total median perbase coverage >100,000X, with ~99.9% of the genome being covered at least 1X. As
accurate structure inference requires a reliable mutational signal, which in turn depends
on the sequencing depth, we imposed a minimum coverage threshold of 1,000X. This
filter retained over 96.5% of the genome. We observed exceptional agreement between
known Beta-CoV secondary structure motifs and our SHAPE-MaP reactivities (Figure 1C

and Figure S2), with on average >76% of highly reactive bases (≥0.7) being annotated
as single-stranded. When including also terminal base-pairs (adjacent to helix termini or
bulges/loops), the measured agreement rose up to ~90%.
Next, we used SHAPE-derived constraints to model the secondary structure of the SARSCoV-2 genome (see Methods). This approach has been extensively validated and
previously applied by us and other groups to successfully map viral RNA structures
(Siegfried et al., 2014; Simon et al., 2019). To convert NAI reactivities into pseudo-free
energy contributions, a complementary SHAPE-MaP dataset was produced by probing
E. coli rRNAs with NAI under ex vivo deproteinized conditions and determined optimal
slope and intercept to be 0.8 and -0.2 by grid search, respectively (Figure S3). By
incorporating these parameters into our RNA Framework algorithm for SHAPE-directed
structure prediction (Incarnato et al., 2018), we have obtained a high-quality single-base
resolution secondary structure map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome (Figure 2).
From the first inspection of our model, it appeared that roughly one half (~55.5%) of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome is structured, in agreement with the observed fraction of low
reactive residues as determined by SHAPE probing (~57.8% of reactivities ≤0.3).
Comparison of the distribution of base reactivities for unpaired, internally-paired, and
terminally-paired residues showed a pattern comparable to that of E. coli ribosomal RNAs
(Figure S4), hence supporting the quality of our SARS-CoV-2 RNA structure model.
Previously described RNA structure elements typical of Sarbecoviruses and other BetaCoV, such as 5′ UTR helices S1 to S7, the ribosomal frameshifting element (FSE) and
the 3′ UTR stem-loop II-like motif (s2m) were all successfully modeled in the context of
the full genome, without the need to impose any hard constraints, further supporting the
high accuracy and reliability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome structure model proposed here.
Interestingly, the recently proposed stem-loops SL8 to SL10 (positions: ~400-450 nt;
Rangan et al., 2020) are not supported by our data. Instead, the region spanning these
three short hairpins appears to be involved in the formation of a large stem-loop-like
structure, spanning nucleotides 407 to 478 (putative stem-loop 8, pSL8).

We next analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 genome structure using a previously defined metric,
the Shannon entropy (Siegfried et al., 2014). The Shannon entropy provides an estimate
of the likelihood of a given RNA region to fold into multiple conformations. Therefore, we
determined the Shannon entropy across the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome and combined
this measure with SHAPE data to identify two sets of regions: regions of persistent singlestrandedness (low Shannon - high SHAPE) and regions stably folding into well-defined
conformations (low Shannon - low SHAPE).
Regions of persistent single-strandedness are unlikely to form any structure (or to be
involved in intramolecular base-pairing, in general), thus representing preferred targets
for the design of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics. Our analysis (see
Methods) identified 70 such regions, at least 25 nucleotides long, spanning a total of 2,910
bases (~9.7% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome) matching these criteria (Figure S5 and Table
S2). We next evaluated the sequence conservation of these regions, by multiple
sequencing alignment with different sets of coronavirus sequences (Figure S6),
specifically: 1) SARS-CoV; 2) MERS-CoV; 3) other Beta-CoV; 4) all other CoV (alpha,
gamma, and delta). Notably, ~23.9% of these regions, accounting for roughly 711 bases
(~2.4% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome), showed over 70% conservation in SARS-CoV
(average ~81.3%) and over 50% conservation in the other three datasets (average
~63.5% for MERS-CoV, ~60.4% for other Beta-CoV, and ~53% for all other CoV).
Particularly, five regions (accounting for a total of 240 bases) showed exceptionally high
conservation in all the analyzed alignments (average SARS-CoV: 86.4%; MERS-CoV:
78.6%; other Beta-CoV: 74.2%; all other CoV: 68.3%), suggesting that some essential
regulatory RNA element might reside here and be under strong selection.
Next, we focused on low Shannon - low SHAPE regions (Figure 3). In total, we identified
149 structure elements having both low SHAPE reactivities, reflecting low nucleotide
dynamics (possibly due to base-pairing), and low Shannon entropies, reflecting high
structural stability, thus the presence of a predominant RNA structural conformation.
Overall, these regions encompassed ~38.6% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (11,547
bases) and included the 5′ and 3′ UTRs. These regions are likely to be involved in the

mechanistic and structural aspects of the viral RNA function. Previous computational
analyses have shown that complex structured RNA molecules often exhibit pockets with
physical properties suitable for small molecule binding, which can be identified in RNA
3D structure models (Hewitt et al., 2019). Thus, the discovery of multiple structured
regions in SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA offered an opportunity to test their potential to be
targeted by small molecules.
Starting from the set of low Shannon - low SHAPE structures, shorter contiguous helices,
that were likely to interact with each other’s, were combined to yield a total of 70 RNA
segments. Then, by using the SimRNA method (Boniecki et al., 2015), we modeled their
3D folding. We used secondary structure information derived from the SHAPE-MaP
experiments to restrain the folding trajectories that sampled the 3D conformational space
in search of local and global energy minima. For each 3D-folded segment, we identified
clusters of the most commonly occurring 3D conformations, and we generated 1000
lowest-energy models to represent the most stable 3D conformations. In general, while
the secondary structures agreed very well with that inferred from experimental probing,
the 3D structures exhibited significant overall conformational variability, which was
expected given the elongated character of secondary structures inferred from
experimental data. Nonetheless, the 3D modeling revealed a number of persistent
complex spatial motifs, often comprising junctions and structured bulges and loops.
Next, we used the Fpocket software (Guilloux et al., 2009) to score the putative druggable
sites in 1000 lowest-energy models for each RNA segment, based on the criteria we
established on a set of experimentally determined 3D structures of small viral RNAs
complexed with small molecule ligands (Figure S7; see Methods). We mapped the
predicted druggable pockets on the RNA sequence to identify clusters of residues that
formed potential ligand-binding sites in the largest fraction of best-energy models (Figures
S8-S57). The majority of targetable pockets are found in high-information-content
structures such as multiway junctions (Figures 4 and Figures S58-S59; Warner et al.,
2018), although they are also very often found in bulges. On the other hand, terminal

loops and symmetrical bulges were rarely identified as druggable sites in SARS-CoV-2
RNA segments.
We identified a druggable pocket at the base of the 3′ stem-loop II-like motif (s2m, found
within the segment 29548-29870; Figure S57). The s2m is a highly conserved motif found
at the 3′-UTRs of astrovirus, coronavirus, and equine rhinovirus genomes (Jonassen et
al., 1998) and has been proposed to affect host translation by either interacting with
ribosomal proteins or by getting processed into a mature microRNA (Robertson et al.,
2004; Tengs et al., 2013). Our analyses also recovered a potentially druggable site within
the FSE (found within the segment 13367-13546; Figure S27), which is crucial for viral
fitness since it allows for the synthesis of functional and structural viral proteins (Brierley
et al., 1989). The latter pocket encompasses a previously reported one, that could be
targeted with a small molecule proven to successfully inhibit the frameshifting activity of
SARS-CoV (Park et al., 2011).
To further prioritize the structured segments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA more likely to represent
functional elements, we devised an automatic strategy for the identification of sequence
segments showing significant base-pair covariation across coronaviruses (see Methods).
By building a first covariance model (CM) using Infernal (Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013) and
the sole SARS-CoV-2 sequence (together with the secondary structure inferred from
SHAPE-MaP data), we searched (with a relaxed E-value cutoff) for homologous
sequences in a non-redundant CoV database, discarding those matches in which less
than 55% of the canonical base-pairs from the SARS-CoV-2 structure were supported.
Furthermore, by taking advantage of the extremely conserved architecture of CoV
genomes (Lauber et al., 2013), we further discarded those matches whose relative
position in the genome changed by more than 3.5% with respect to that of SARS-CoV-2.
The resulting alignment was then used to refine the CM and the whole procedure was
repeated three times.
This analysis identified a total of 12 RNA elements (out of the originally selected 149 low
Shannon - low SHAPE structures, ~8%) for which at least 5% of the canonical base-pairs

showed significant covariation (on average, 15.1% at E-value < 0.05, 18.6% at E-value <
0.1), as determined by the R-scape software (Rivas et al., 2016). Among these, our
pipeline successfully recovered both the SL5 element of Sarbecovirus 5′ UTR and the 3′
UTR (Figure S60). Furthermore, we recovered a number of high-information-content
structures for which the Fpocket analysis identified high-scoring, putative druggable
pockets (Figure 5). These RNA structures show variable degrees of conservation across
different CoV genera, with 6 out of 12 (50%) being conserved in both Alpha-CoV and
Gamma-CoV, and 4 of them being conserved in Delta-CoV as well (Figure S61). It is
however worth pointing out that, while the presence of covariation can support the
presence of functional RNA structures, the lack of covariation due to high sequence
conservation does not provide any statistical support for such conclusions. Therefore,
although we did not find sufficient significant covariation support for the remaining
structures (possibly also due to the stringency of our filtering criteria), many of them can
anyway represent either recently evolved RNA structures or RNA cis-regulatory elements
residing within regions whose sequence is constrained by the underlying amino-acid
sequence.
In summary, in this study, we described the RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV2 virus. Starting with the experimentally-informed inference of the secondary structure of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we produced 3D models for sequence segments likely to fold
into stable 3D structures and we identified putative druggable pockets in these structures.
Many of them presented high-information-content geometries, such as multiway
junctions, that represent attractive RNA 3D targets for further analyses. Importantly, some
of these structures also showed significant covariation, supporting their functional
importance for SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our analyses reveal structures of the SARS-CoV-2
virus RNA that may turn out to be its weak spots. Not only our data will provide a
fundamental resource for the development of innovative RNA-targeted therapeutic
strategies, but also it will help elucidating still unknown aspects of the life cycle of
coronaviruses once the functional role of the structured elements in the coronavirus RNA
genome here identified will be characterized.

Method Details
Synthesis of NAI
NAI was synthesized as previously described (Spitale et al., 2013). Briefly, 137.14 mg of
2-methylpyridine-3-carboxylic acid (Sigma Aldrich, cat. 325228) were resuspended in 500
μl

DMSO

~162.15

mg

of

1,1’-

Carbonyldiimidazole (Sigma Aldrich, cat. 115533) were resuspended in 500 μl DMSO
anhydrous and added dropwise to the 2-methylpyridine-3-carboxylic acid solution while
constantly stirring, over a period of 5 minutes. The reaction mixture was then incubated
at room temperature with constant stirring for 2 hours. This mixture (assumed to represent
a 1 M stock) was aliquoted in 50 μl aliquots and stored at -80°C.
Cell culture and SARS-CoV-2 infection
Vero E6 cells were cultured in T-175 flasks in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; Lonza, cat. 12-604F), supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum (FCS; Bodinco), 2
mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich,
cat. P4333-20ML) at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%–99% humidity. Cells
were infected at a MOI of 1.5 with SARS-CoV-2/Leiden-0002 (GenBank accession:
MT510999), a clinical isolate obtained from a nasopharyngeal sample at LUMC, which
was passaged twice in Vero E6 cells before use. Infections were performed in Eagle’s
minimal essential medium (EMEM; Lonza, cat. 12-611F) supplemented with 25 mM
HEPES, 2% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. At 16 h post-infection, infected cells
were harvested by trypsinization, followed by resuspension in EMEM supplemented with
2% FCS, and then washed with 50 mL 1X PBS.
All experiments with infectious SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level 3 facility

added. The sample was vigorously vortexed for 15 sec and then incubated for 2 min at
room temperature, after which it was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,500 x g (4°C). The upper
aqueous phase was collected in a clean 2 mL tube, supplemented with 1 mL (~2 volumes)
of 100% ethanol, and then loaded on an RNA Clean & Concentrator-25 column (Zymo
Research, cat. R1017). For in vitro folding, ~2 μg of total RNA in a volume of 39 μl were
denatured at 95°C for 2 min, then transferred immediately to ice and incubated for 1 min.
10 μl of ice-cold 5X RNA Folding Buffer [500 mM HEPES pH 7.9; 500 mM NaCl]
supplemented with 20 U of SUPERase•In™ RNase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific,
cat. AM2696) were added. RNA was then incubated for 10 min at 37°C to allow secondary
structure formation. Subsequently, 1 μl of 500 mM MgCl2 (pre-warmed at 37°C) was
added and RNA was further incubated for 20 min at 37°C to allow tertiary structure
formation.
Probing of RNA
For probing of RNA, NAI was added to a final concentration of 50 mM and samples were
incubated at 37°C for 10 min. A negative control reaction was also prepared, by adding
an equal amount of DMSO. Reactions were then quenched by the addition of 1 volume
DTT 1 M and then purified on an RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 column (Zymo Research,
cat. R1013).
Extraction of native deproteinized E. coli rRNAs
Deproteinized E. coli RNA was prepared essentially as previously described (Simon et
al., 2019), with minor changes. Briefly, a single colony of Escherichia coli K-12 DH10B
was picked and inoculated in LB medium without antibiotics, then grown to exponential
phase (OD600 ~ 0.5). 2 mL aliquots were collected by centrifugation at 1000 x g (4°C) for
5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of Resuspension Buffer [15 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0; 450 mM Sucrose; 8 mM EDTA], and lysozyme was added to a final concentration
of 100 μg/mL. After incubation at 22°C for 5 min and on ice for 10 min, protoplasts were
collected by centrifugation at 5000 x g (4°C) for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 120
μl Protoplast Lysis Buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2; 1.5%
SDS], supplemented with 0.2 μg/μl Proteinase K. Samples were incubated for 5 min at

22°C and for 5 min on ice. SDS was removed by addition of 30 μl SDS Precipitation Buffer
[50 mM HEPES pH 8.0; 1 M Potassium Acetate; 5 mM MgCl2], followed by centrifugation
at 17,000 x g (4°C) for 5 min. Supernatant was then extracted 2 times with
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, pre-equilibrated 3 times with a buffer
containing [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0; 200 mM NaCl; 5 mM MgCl2]), and once with
chloroform. 20 U SUPERase•In™ RNase Inhibitor were then added and RNA was
equilibrated at 37°C for 20 min prior to probing.
Ex vivo probing of E. coli rRNAs
180 μl of deproteinized E. coli rRNAs, pre-equilibrated at 37°C for 20 min, were mixed
with 20 μl of NAI. RNA was then allowed to react at 37°C for 15 minutes, with moderate
shaking, after which 200 μl of 1 M DTT were added, to quench the reaction. Samples
were then vortexed briefly and 1 mL of ice-cold QIAzol added to each sample, followed
by extensive vortexing. RNA extraction was carried out as already described above for
SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.
Multiplex SHAPE-MaP of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
For multiplex SHAPE-MaP, 70 oligonucleotide pairs, tiling the entire length of the SARSCoV-2 genome (29,903 nt), were automatically designed using Primer3 (Untergasser et
al., 2012) and the following parameters: amplicon size between 480 and 520 bp,
maximum poly(N) length between 2 and 3, minimum/optimal/maximum oligonucleotide
size

of

20/25/30,

minimum/optimal/maximum

Tm

of

56/60/62

degrees,

minimum/optimal/maximum GC content of 30/50/65 %. Also, pairs were designed in such
a way that the target amplicon would include the target region of the reverse primer from
the previous set and of the forward primer of the following set. Primers were then
searched against the GENCODE v33 human transcriptome, keeping only those with less
than 60% predicted base-pairing or more than 60% predicted base-pairing and more than
2 mismatched bases at the 3′ end. For reverse transcription, all reverse primers were
equimolarly pooled to yield a 100 μM RT primer mix. An additional anchored oligo-dT
primer (TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN) was added to the mix. For each sample, two 20
μl reverse transcription reactions were carried out. 3 μg of total RNA were mixed with 0.5

μl RT primer mix and 1 μl dNTPs (10 mM each), incubated at 70°C for 5 min and then
transferred immediately to ice for 1 min. Reactions were then supplemented with 4 μl 5X
RT Buffer [250 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3; 375 mM KCl], 2 μl DTT 0.1 M, 1 μl MnCl2 120 mM,
20 U SUPERase•In™ RNase Inhibitor and 200 U SuperScript II RT (ThermoFisher
Scientific, cat. 18064014). Reactions were incubated at 42°C for 2 h and then RT was
heat-inactivated at 75°C for 15 min. RNA was then degraded by the addition of 5 U RNase
H (New England Biolabs, cat. M0297S) and cDNA from every 2 reactions was purified on
a single RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 column and eluted in 36 μl NF H2O.
For targeted amplification, primer pairs were split into 2 non-overlapping sets, odd and
even. For each of these sets, pairs were pooled in smaller sets of 3-4 pairs, as follows:
1-19-37-55, 2-20-38-56, 3-21-39-57, 4-22-40-58, 5-23-41-59, 6-24-42-60, 7-25-43-61, 826-44-62, 9-27-45-63, 10-28-46-64, 11-29-47-65, 12-30-48-66, 13-31-49-67, 14-32-5068, 15-33-51-69, 16-34-52-70, 17-35-53, 18-36-54. The complete primer list can be found
in Table S1. PCR reactions were carried out in 50 μl, using 2 μl of eluted cDNA, 0.3 mM
final each dNTP, 0.1 μM final each primer in the set and 2.5 U TaKaRa Taq™ DNA
Polymerase (TaKaRa, cat. R001A). Cycling was performed using a touch-down
approach. Briefly, for the first 10 cycles, the annealing temperature was lowered by 0.5°C
per cycle, starting at 58°C. Then, 20 additional cycles were performed at the lowest
temperature. PCR products were purified using 1 volume of NucleoMag NGS Clean-up
and Size Select beads (Macherey Nagel, cat. 744970), checked on a 2% agarose gel.
Each primer set gave a single specific band of the expected size. PCR products were
equimolarly pooled to yield the final odd and even sets. 500 ng of each set were
fragmented in a final volume of 20 μl, using 2 μl of NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase (New
England Biolabs, cat. M0348), supplemented with 1 μl 200 mM MgCl2, by incubating at
37°C for 25 min. This yielded fragments in the range of ~50-200 bp. Reactions were
purified using 1 volume of NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size Select beads. 5 ng of
fragmented DNA were then used as input for the NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep
Kit for Illumina® (New England Biolabs, cat. E7645L), as per manufacturer instructions.

SHAPE-MaP of E. coli rRNAs
Total E. coli RNA was first fragmented to a median size of 150 nt by incubation at 94°C
for 8 min in RNA Fragmentation Buffer [65 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0; 95 mM KCl; 4 mM MgCl2],
then purified with NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size Select beads (Macherey Nagel,
cat. 744970), supplemented with 10 U SUPERase•In™ RNase Inhibitor, and eluted in 2
μl NF H2O. Eluted RNA was supplemented with 0.5 μl 20 μM random hexamers and 0.25
μl dNTPs (10 mM each), then incubated at 70°C for 5 min and immediately transferred to
ice for 1 min. Reverse transcription reactions were conducted in a final volume of 5 μl.
Reactions were supplemented with 1 μl 5X RT Buffer [250 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3; 375 mM
KCl], 0.5 μl DTT 0.1 M, 0.25 μl MnCl2 120 mM, 5 U SUPERase•In™ RNase Inhibitor and
50 U SuperScript II RT. Reactions were incubated at 25°C for 10 min to allow partial
primer extension, followed by 2 h at 42°C. SSII was heat-inactivated by incubating at 75°C
for 15 min. 6 mM final EDTA was added to chelate Mn2+ ions, followed by 5 min incubation
at room temperature and addition of 6 mM final MgCl2. Reverse transcription reactions
were then used as input for the NEBNext® Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand
Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs, cat. E6111L). Second strand synthesis was
performed by incubating 1 h at 16°C, as per manufacturer instructions. DsDNA was
purified using NucleoMag NGS Clean-up and Size Select beads, and used as input for
the NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, following manufacturer
instructions.
SHAPE-MaP data analysis
Analysis of SHAPE-MaP data has been conducted using RNA Framework v2.6.9
(https://github.com/dincarnato/RNAFramework; Incarnato et al., 2018). Reads preprocessing and mapping was performed using the rf-map module (parameters: -ctn -cmn
0 -cqo -cq5 20 -b2 -mp "--very-sensitive-local"). Reads were trimmed of terminal Ns and
low-quality bases (Phred < 20). Reads with internal Ns were discarded. Mapping was
performed using the “very-sensitive-local” preset of Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg,
2012). The mutational signal was then derived using the rf-count module (parameters: m -rd), enabling the right re-alignment of deletions. When processing SARS-CoV-2 data,
a mask file containing the sequences of primer pairing regions was passed along (through

the -mf parameter). Generated RC files, from both the even and odd sets, containing per
base mutation counts and coverage, were then combined in a single RC file using the rfrctools module (mode: merge). Data normalization was performed using the rf-norm
module (parameters: -sm 3 -nm 3 -n 1000 -mm 1), by setting the minimum base coverage
to 1,000X and the maximum mutation frequency to 1, and by using the Siegfried et al.,
2014 scoring scheme (Siegfried et al., 2014) and box-plot normalization of SHAPE
reactivities.
SHAPE-informed SARS-CoV-2 RNA secondary structure modeling
To model the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we first sought to
determine optimal slope/intercept parameters by grid search, using the rf-jackknife
module (parameters: -rp “-md 600 -nlp” -x) and ViennaRNA package v2.4.14 (Lorenz et
al., 2011), with E. coli SHAPE-MaP data and reference E. coli 16S/23S rRNA structures
(Cannone et al., 2002). Isolated base-pairs were disallowed, the maximum base-pairing
distance was set to 600 nt and the relaxed structure comparison mode was enabled (a
base pair i/j was considered to be correctly predicted if any of the following pairs exist in
the reference structure: i/j; i-1/j; i+1/j; i/j-1; i/j+1; Deigan et al., 2009). Optimal slope and
intercept parameters were respectively determined to be -0.8 and 0.2 (extremely close to
previously determined parameters -1.1 and 0; Huber et al., 2019).
As folding the full SARS-CoV-2 genome as a single entity would be an extremely
challenging, and currently unfeasible, computational task, folding was performed using
the rf-fold module and a windowed approach previously used by us and other groups
(Siegfried et al., 2014; Simon et al., 2019) to model viral RNA genomes (parameters: -sl
0.8 -in -0.2 -w -fw 3000 -fo 300 -wt 200 -pw 1500 -po 250 -dp -sh -nlp -md 600). At all
stages, SHAPE data was incorporated in the form of soft constraints. Briefly, in the first
stage partition function folding was performed by sliding a window of 1,500 nt along the
genome, with an offset of 250 nt. For each window, the first and last 100 nt were ignored,
to avoid terminal biases. Two additional foldings were computed at both the 5′ and 3′ ends
to increase structure sampling (window sizes: 1,400 and 1,450 nt). Base-pairing
probabilities from all windows were then averaged and base-pairs with a probability ≥0.99
were kept and used as a constraint for the next stage. At this stage, base-pairing

probabilities were also used to calculate per-base Shannon entropies. In the second
stage, the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure was predicted by sliding a
window of 3,000 nt, with an offset of 300 nt along the genome. Four additional foldings
were computed at both the 5′ and 3′ ends to increase structure sampling (window sizes:
2,900, 2,950, 3,050, and 3,100 nt). Base-pairs appearing in >50% of the windows were
then retained to yield the final secondary structure pseudoknot-free model. Pseudoknots
were instead introduced during the modeling of the 3D structure (see paragraph
“Selection of structured segments for RNA 3D structure prediction” below).
Identification of candidate low Shannon – low/high SHAPE regions
For the identification of low Shannon – low SHAPE regions, median Shannon entropies
and SHAPE reactivities were first calculated in sliding, centered 50 nt windows. Then, a
window of 50 nt was slid along the genome. Windows in which >75% of the bases were
below both the global Shannon and SHAPE median (calculated on the full SARS-CoV-2
genome) were picked and windows residing less than 10 nt apart were merged. Only
structure elements having >50% of the base-pairs falling in a low Shannon – low SHAPE
region were kept for downstream analyses. For the identification of low Shannon – high
SHAPE regions, instead, a window of 25 nt was slid along the genome. Windows in which
>75% of the bases were below the global Shannon median and above the global SHAPE
median (calculated on the full SARS-CoV-2 genome) and >50% of the bases were
predicted to be single-stranded in the MEA structure, were picked and windows residing
less than 10 nt apart were merged.
Identification of conserved RNA structure elements
To identify conserved low Shannon – low SHAPE RNA structure elements, we
implemented an automated pipeline (cm-builder; https://github.com/dincarnato/labtools)
built on top of Infernal 1.1.3 (Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013). Briefly, we first built a covariance
model (CM) from a Stockholm file containing only the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and the
structure of the selected elements, using the cmbuild module. After calibrating the CM
using the cmcalibrate module, it was used to search for RNA homologs in a database
composed of all the non-redundant coronavirus complete genome sequences from the

ViPR database (https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=corona; Pickett et al.,
2011), as well as a set of representative coronavirus genomes from NCBI database, using
the cmsearch module. Only matches from the sense strand were kept and a very relaxed
E-value threshold of 10 was used at this stage to select potential homologs. Three
additional filtering criteria were used. First, we took advantage of the extremely conserved
architecture of coronavirus genomes (Lauber et al., 2013) and restricted the selection to
matches falling at the same relative position within their genome, with a tolerance of 3.5%
(roughly corresponding to a maximum allowed shift of 1050 nt in a 30 kb genome).
Through this more “conservative” selection, we only kept matches likely to represent true
structural homologs, although at the cost of probably losing some true matches. Second,
we filtered out matches retaining less than 55% of the canonical base-pairs from the
original structure elements. Third, truncated hits covering <50% of the structure were
discarded. The resulting set of homologs was then aligned to the original CM using the
cmalign module and the resulting alignment was used to build a new CM. The whole
process was repeated for a total of 3 times. The alignment was then refactored, removing
gap-only positions and including only bases spanning the first to the last base-paired
residue. The alignment file was then analyzed using R-scape 1.4.0 (Rivas et al., 2016)
and APC-corrected G-test statistics to identify motifs showing significantly covarying
base-pairs. To increase the likelihood of selecting only bona fide conserved RNA
structural elements, we discarded any structure with less than 5% covarying pairs at Evalue < 0.05 and less than 10% covarying pairs at E-value < 0.1. Stockholm files for these
structures were then used to build the final CMs and to re-search the entire database with
the default stringent E-value cutoff of 0.01.
Determination of low Shannon – high SHAPE regions’ conservation
To assess the sequence conservation of the identified low Shannon – high SHAPE
regions, we computed 4 multiple sequence alignments using MAFFT v7.429 (parameters:
--maxiterate 100 --auto; Katoh and Standley, 2013), the reference SARS-CoV-2
sequence and one of the following datasets: 1) SARS-CoV (243 sequences); 2) MERSCoV (281 sequences); 3) other Beta-CoV (excluding SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2/MERSCoV, 681 sequences); 4) other CoV (excluding Beta-CoV, 1657 sequences). Sequences

were obtained from the ViPR database and 100% identical sequences were collapsed.
Region conservation was calculated as the average of the conservation of each
nucleotide in that region (using SARS-CoV-2 as the reference).
Selection of structured segments for RNA 3D structure prediction
Starting from the chosen low Shannon - low SHAPE regions, sequence segments for
RNA 3D structure prediction were selected based on their predicted structural complexity,
mutual proximity, as well as the proximity of other predicted structural elements. Briefly,
neighboring segments were combined with each other. Very short (< 40 nt) low Shannon
- low SHAPE regions predicted to fold into simple hairpins were not analyzed further,
unless they could be combined with each other or incorporated into neighboring larger
fragments. When predicted secondary structure elements were present in the immediate
proximity of low Shannon – low SHAPE regions, suggesting the possibility of additional
structural interactions, the sequence segments were expanded to include them. For
example, the modeled segment for the frameshifting element comprises a short low
Shannon - low SHAPE 70 nt region that was extended in both the 5′ and 3′ directions in
order to encompass the neighboring regions predicted to be structured yielding a 180 ntlong segment.
For the final set of 70 segments, we carried out an additional secondary structure
prediction step with a customized version of RNAProbe (Wirecki et al., 2020), using
ShapeKnots (incorporating SHAPE-MaP reactivities) to evaluate the presence of
potential pseudoknots (Hajdin et al., 2013). Finally, the base-pairing patterns common to
both the original pseudoknot-free MEA prediction and the ShapeKnots prediction were
used to restrain the 3D folding simulations.
RNA 3D structure modeling
3D structures were predicted for the aforementioned segments using SimRNA, a method
for simulations of RNA folding, which uses a coarse-grained representation, relies on the
Monte Carlo method for sampling the conformational space, and employs a statistical
potential to approximate the energy of the studied RNA molecule (Boniecki et al., 2015;
Magnus et al., 2016). The previously derived consensus secondary structure was used

as a restraint. Briefly, for segments >90 nt, which exhibited complex structures, we carried
out eight independent simulations, each comprising 10 replicas, with 16 million Monte
Carlo steps in each run). For segments <90 nt, that were mostly expected to adopt
hairpin-like structures, we carried out only one simulation (10 replicas, 16 million Monte
Carlo steps). Each simulation resulted in a trajectory, comprising up to 10,000
conformations, broadly representing local energy minima in the whole conformational
space sampled by SimRNA for a given molecule.
For each segment, the 5% top-scored conformations were clustered at the RMSD
threshold equal to 0.1 times the length of the sequence, yielding clusters of similar
conformations (up to 10 clusters for each sequence segment). A single representative of
each cluster was retained to represent the most probable class of conformations. Further,
1000 best-scored conformations for each segment, which together represent the lowenergy regions of the conformational landscape and approximate the distribution of most
common conformations existing in solution, were used to identify potential binding sites
for small molecules. For each of the 1000 models, the secondary structure was extracted
by running ClaRNA (Waleń et al., 2014) and the set of 1000 secondary structures was
used to generate the consensus structure for each segment.
Prediction of potential ligand binding sites in RNA 3D structures (druggable
pockets)
To identify potential ligand-binding pockets in RNA 3D structures, we used Fpocket (Le
Guilloux, Schmidtke, and Tuffery 2009), originally developed for the identification of
ligand-binding pockets in proteins. We conducted a benchmarking study on a small
subset of known viral RNA structures bound to their small molecule ligands (PDB codes:
1LVJ [HIV-1 TAR with PMZ], 1UTS [HIV-1 TAR with P13], 2KMJ [HIV-2 TAR with a
pyrimidinylpeptide], 2KTZ [HCV IRES with ISH], and 2L94 [HIV-1 FSE with the
frameshifting inhibitor DB213]). These RNAs were folded using SimRNA (one simulation
with 10 replicas and 16 million Monte Carlo steps). For each RNA, 1000 decoys with the
lowest SimRNA energy were identified and analyzed with Fpocket. In each analyzed
model, a ribonucleotide residue with at least two atoms within the pocket was considered
as a potential ligand-contacting residue. For each residue in each RNA, a score of 0 to

100 was assigned based on the total number of contacts predicted in the 1000 low-energy
conformations. The residues with a score of 40 or above successfully recapitulated the
regions in the structures to which ligands were binding, as experimentally determined in
4 out of 5 structures. The sole instance in which a binding pocket could not be retrieved
by Fpocket was the ligand-binding site without a specific pocket in the 2L94 structure, in
which the ligand binds in the major groove of the RNA helix.
To retrieve the potentially druggable pockets in complex 3D motifs from the SARS-CoV2 models, we applied a more stringent criterion. The residues with an Fpocket score of
40 or above were selected and extended by one residue on either side to include the
neighbors at the sequence level. After the extension, the stretches with six nucleotides or
more were retained. The shorter stretches were added, if any of their constituent residues
were paired with the longer ones, based on the consensus secondary structure derived
from 1000 lowest-energy decoys. Additional residues forming Watson-Crick base pairs
with the nucleotides in these stretches were also included in further analyses. For each
of the 1000 decoys, pairwise atom-atom distances were calculated to identify groups of
residues present as neighbors in 3D-space. The residues consistently present within a
12 Å cut-off distance were assigned to one pocket. The identified pockets were clustered
and representatives (most prevalent conformation) were selected for up to the five biggest
clusters.

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Genome-wide SHAPE-MaP analysis of SARS-CoV-2. (A) Schematic of the
multiplex targeted SHAPE-MaP approach for querying the SARS-CoV-2 genome from
total RNA. (B) Heat scatter plot showing the correlation between SHAPE-MaP reactivities
for the two replicates (R2 = 0.987). (C) Measured SHAPE-MaP reactivities superimposed
on the reference Sarbecovirus 5′ UTR structure.
Figure 2. Structure map of the full SARS-CoV-2 genome. Maximum expected
accuracy (MEA) structure representation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Bases are colorcoded according to SHAPE-MaP reactivities. Bases with coverage lower than 1000X are
marked in grey. The approximate genomic position is indicated every 1000 nt. Structure
was plotted with VARNA (Darty et al., 2009).
Figure 3. Identification of RNA regions with well-defined foldings. Map of the SARSCoV-2 genome depicting (top to bottom): median SHAPE reactivity (in 50 nt centered
widows, with respect to the median reactivity across the whole genome), Shannon
entropy, base-pairing probabilities, maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure.
Regions with both low Shannon and low SHAPE, likely identifying RNA regions with welldefined foldings, are marked in grey and depicted as green arcs below the MEA structure.
Three regions with sequencing coverage below 1,000X are marked in red.
Figure 4. 3D modeling of SARS-CoV-2 RNA structured segments and identification
of druggable pockets. Consensus secondary structure for segment 7808-8229 (A), and
segment 22780-22913 (B), as derived from the 1000 lowest energy 3D structure
structures modeled by SimRNA (using the MEA secondary structure inferred from
SHAPE-MaP as a restraint). Residues composing the identified druggable pockets are
shaded. Different shading colors mark distinct pockets. The 3D model of the medoid
structure from the most abundant cluster is also shown, with pockets colored as for the
secondary structure. The insets show the atomic representation of the identified pockets.

Figure 5. Structure of conserved elements in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Structure models for
segments 7924-8128 (A), and 22826-22913 (B). Both segments consist of conserved
three-way junction structures (see Figure 4). Structure models have been generated
using the R2R software. Base-pairs showing significant covariation (as determined by Rscape) are boxed in green (E-value < 0.05) and violet (E-value < 0.1) respectively.
Alongside, the structure of each segment in SARS-CoV-2 with superimposed SHAPEMaP reactivities is shown, together with the putative conserved structure in other CoV as
derived from the alignment and manually optimized with the ViennaRNA package.
