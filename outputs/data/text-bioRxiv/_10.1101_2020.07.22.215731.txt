Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating effect on the healthcare system and the
economy of the world. The unavailability of a specific treatment regime and a candidate vaccine
yet opens up scope for new approaches and discoveries of drugs for mitigation of the sufferings
of humankind due to the disease. The present isolated whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2
from 11 different nations subjected to evolutionary study and genome-wide association study
through in silico approaches including multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic study through
MEGA7 and have been analyzed through DNAsp respectively. These investigations recognized
the nucleotide varieties and single nucleotide mutations/polymorphisms on the genomic regions
as well as protein-coding regions. The resulted mutations have diversified the genomic contents
of SARS-CoV-2 according to the altered nucleotides found in 11 genome sequences. India and
Nepal have found to have progressively more distinct species of SARS-CoV-2 with variations in
Spike protein and Nucleocapsid protein-coding sites. These genomic variations might be the
explanation behind the less case fatality rate of India and Nepal dependent on the populaces. The
anticipated idea of this investigation upgrades the information about genomic medication and
might be useful in the planning of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is the 7th beta coronavirus isolated from Wuhan, China in
December 20191. COVID-19 is not only just threatening the public health but also affecting
social stability and economic development2. Among the previously identified six human CoVs
including 229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43, SARS, and MERS the highly pathogenic strains were
SARS, MERS in contrast to the others3. Of them, COVID19 has pandemic since it has spread
more than 200 countries rapidly1. The World Health Organization declared it as a public health
emergency of international concern because of its rapid spread to so many countries4. Along with
the respiratory illness, the strong virulence of SARS-CoV-2 also causes multi-organ failure,
including renal and neurological ailments2, 5.
CoVs are single-stranded RNA viruses, and share a large genome around 30kb, express
abundant replica genes encoding non-structural proteins involving approximately 20kb of the
genome6. The genome comprises of a 5’ terminal an open reading box (ORF) 1a/b coding region,
Spike (S) glycoprotein, Envelope (E) protein, Membrane (M) protein, Nucleocapsid (N) protein
and a 3’ terminal noncoding region. Among these S protein specifically bind to the receptor of
the host cell and mediates membrane fusion and virus entry5, 7. In contrast, N protein has
involved in the assembly of the virus inside the host cell, and it is necessary for viral RNA
transcription and replication7-8; thus these two proteins have been reported as the most prominent
proteins for progression of viral infections. According to the updated data of the WHO, the ratio
of confirmed cases and the death rates are varying from country to country. This is because of
the climate variability, which is known to affect the outbreaks of many infectious diseases. Thus
different infection fatality rate might be taking place by the impacts of environmental factors on
the genomic content of SARS-CoV-2, changing the functionality or virulence at the particular
condition. Consequently more investigations would be required for better investigation of SARSCoV-2 genomic architecture and the hereditary varieties as indicated by different ecological
states of various nations. The study aims to unravel the reason for the different infection and
variable death rates amongst the aftected countries in the world.

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) has resulted in an unprecedented
explosion of genomic sequence data. The genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and
comprehensive identification of genetic variants in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) across the genomes of individuals is a definite prerequisite for translational genomic
medicine

9-11

. Thus this study focuses on the genomic sequence divergence and genetic

variability within the available whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from affected
countries with different infction mortality rates.

2. Material and Methods
2.1.

Sequence Mining

There were total 92 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from different preceding
countries

throughout

the

world,

have

been

deposited

in

the

genome

database

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) of National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) web portal. Among these available genome sequences,
this study retrieved a total of 11 genome sequences of first cases of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from
11 different counties, including the reference genome isolated from Wuhan, China, in FASTA
format. Along with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the genome sequence of Bat
Coronavirus has also collected from NCBI for further phylogeny study.
2.2.

Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis

All the collected genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were subjected to multiple sequence
alignment through

the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis 7

(MEGA 7)12

(https://www.megasoftware.net/) package by using the MUSCLE algorithm. Among the aligned
sequences, the highly mismatched sequences or the large gap regions have removed. The good
quality based aligned sequences have considered for generating the phylogenetic tree by using
the maximum parsimony method with 1000 bootstrap replicates.
2.3.

Study of Nucleotide Diversity and Haplotype

The study of genomics diversity has been implemented on the aligned sequences to analyze the
difference between the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by examining the variable sites,
Nucleotide, and haplotype diversity in retrieved genome sequences through DNA sequence
polymorphism software DNAsp 6 (http://www.ub.edu/dnasp/)

13

. The resulted haplotype

diversity has represented through a population genetic software, i.e., population analysis with
reticulate trees (PopART 1.7) (http://popart.otago.ac.nz/index.shtml) 14.

2.4.

Isolation of Mutation Sites in Coding Regions

The resulted variable sites have been analysed, and identified the respective nucleotides in 11
genome sequences from GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) of NCBI.
The respective coded genes in the variable sites have also been analyzed.
2.5.

Retrieval of Worldwide Reports of COVID19

The populations by 2020 of analysed countries have been collected from world meter
(https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).

Also,

the

total

confirmed cases and number of deaths of COVID-19 as per 6 June 20202 had collected from
th

WHO. These retrieved data have been used to calculate the infection fatality rate of COVID-19
in selected countries. Further, the co-relation impact of mutational effects on death rates has
been analysed.

Results

3.1.

Sequence Analysis

The collected whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from 11 different countries,
including Brazil, Nepal, USA, Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Sweden, India, Italy, Vietnam,
and China (Table 1) have aligned through MEGA. Including 11 sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the
genome sequence of Bat coronavirus has also been aligned to represent sequence divergence by
constructing a phylogenetic tree followed by maximum parsimony method with 1000 bootstrap
replicates. The established phylogenetic tree contains 2 clades, Clade I and II. In Clade I, the
genome sequences of the USA, Taiwan, Nepal, Vietnam, China, and India have been grouped,
but India has diversified with individual taxa from the other countries. However, in Clade II,
Sweden, Italy, Australia, South Korea, and Brazil have been grouped. Meanwhile, the genome
sequence of Bat coronavirus clearly showed its divergence from another 11 genome sequence of
SARS-CoV-2, as it has not included in any of the resulting clades of the phylogenetic tree (Fig.
1).
3.2.

Diversity Study

In the multiple aligned genome sequences, the nucleotide diversities and/or DNA polymorphism
have analyzed through DNAsp. There were a total of 29990 nucleotide sides, with 0.00023
nucleotide diversity, which has resulted. The polymorphic site analysis has predicted 29762
monomorphic (invariable) sites, 34 polymorphic (variable) sites, or mutations. Meanwhile, the
haplotype diversity has resulted in total 11 haplotypes with 1.000 haplotype diversity within 11
whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). The haplotype network represents the
number of genetic mutations between the sequences (Fig. 2).
3.3.

Mutational analysis

On analysis, 34 variable regions or polymorphic sites were identified, out of which 30 were
singletons i.e. 28, 1548, 2269, 2277, 2717, 2971, 6031, 6695, 9274, 10232, 12115, 13225,
13226, 14657, 14805, 15597, 17373, 17376, 19065, 20936, 22224, 22303, 22785, 23952, 25775,

26354, 26729, 28077, 28792 and 4 were parsimony sites i.e. 8782, 24034, 26144, 28144. (Table
3). All the variable sites have been analyzed in GenBank to isolate the respective nucleotides for
all 11 genome sequences to identify the single nucleotide mutations/polymorphisms (SNPs) in
these particular variable sites (Table 3). According to the analyzed SNPs, there were no
mutations found in singleton sites 22785 and 23952. In contrast, the most sequence variations
with three nucleotides found in singleton variable regions, including 2971, 6031, and 10232 in
11 countries. However, some mutations contained the complementary base pair nucleotides.
Furthermore, these identified variable regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have defined
as protein-coding regions. This study has analyzed only the coding regions of Spike (S) protein
and Nucleocapsid (N) protein in the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 of 11 countries
submitted at NCBI. It has identified that the coding regions of S (21563-25384) and N protein
(28274-29533) of SARS-CoV-2 are similar in nine countries from four different continents. The
coding regions of S protein and N protein in genome sequences obtained from India [S (2155025368) and N (28258-29517)] and Nepal [S (21548-25369) and N (28274-29533)] are different
from rest sequences isolated from other countries. However, the resulted variable sites within
the coding regions of S protein are 22224, 22303, 22785, 23952 and the variable site within N
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 28792.
3.4. SNPs in Protein Coding Sites
a.

S protein coding region variability

The found SNPs in the S protein coding region 22224 are variable between India, Korea, and
Nepal i.e. at this position “G” is present in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from India and
South Korea; “T” is present in Nepal; whereas rest of the isolated genomes from other countries
contain “C” at 22224 position. Likewise, the isolated genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from
India and Australia at position 22303 contains “G,” which varies from different countries. There
are no mutations found in 22785 and 23952 positions. (Table 3)
b. N protein coding region variability
In the coding variable position 28792 of N protein India, Nepal and USA showed variation than
other countries as follows; Indian genome sequence contains “G”, in case of Nepal the present

Nucleotide is “C” and in case of USA the Nucleotide is “T” and in other countries the genomic
sequence contains “A” at the respective position, which codes N protein of SARS-CoV-2. (Table
3)
3.5. Analysis of Infection Fatality Rate
The infection fatality rates have calculated from the retrieved number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 and deaths related to COVID-19 as per 6th July, 2020 of the pandemic in 11 different
countries (Fig. 3). According to the resulted fatality rates, Italy (0.144) has the highest death rate,
followed by Sweden (0.075). In Asian countries, China has (0.054) the highest case fatality rate
compared to India (0.028), South Korea (0.021), Taiwan (0.015), and Nepal (0.002).
Interestingly country like Vietnam (0) has a zero fatality rate of COVID-19 till 6 July 2020 (Fig.
th

4). Two significant countries from both the North and South American continent, i.e., USA
(0.0456) and Brazil (0.040) have comparable infection fatality rate. (Table 4). The fatality rate
for Australia was 0.012. When comparing deaths and the number of cases based on population
for the USA, approximately 0.85% of the population has been infected, while in India, only
0.05% of the population has the disease (Table 4) (Fig. 3).

4. Discussion
The fast transmission of novel SARS-CoV-2, among individuals in the various areas of the
world, is apparently keeping pandemic unrestricted. The spread of this emerging virus is mainly
by droplets, which is affecting the respiratory tract mucosa and attaches with ACE receptor
present of the surface epithelium of the alveoli of lungs. Because of its exceptional genomic
development, it has a higher transmission rate than SARS and MERs, and it is amazingly testing
to characterize the job of hereditary changeability as well as polymorphisms in the genomic
content separated from various nations.
The constructed phylogenetic tree represents the closely related and divergence in the
genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, isolated from 11 countries. In the two major clades, I and II
Nepal, India, and Brazil have diverged from other sequences that represent the genetic diversity
in the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences isolated from these regions. These outcomes have more
clarified by the genetic diversity study, including nucleotide assorted variety and polymorphism
investigation, which are the key boundaries to recognize the genomic fluctuation or arrangement
contrasts as SNPs 15-16 by comparing the nucleotide sequences. SNPs are the most common type
of genetic variations and have become an essential genetic marker for human mapping disease,
genetics, and evolutionary studies

15

. The resulted 11 haplotypes in the aligned genome

sequences showed the number of mutations and the genetic difference between the genomic
alleles of SARS-Cov-2, although in the analyzed 34 polymorphic sites altered nucleotides have
found which satisfied the differentiation in isolated genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2.
Meanwhile, according to S protein-coding regions, India, Korea, Nepal showed the altered
Nucleotide than others and in case of N protein-coding regions SNPs found in the SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences isolated from India and Australia. Again it has been identified that India and
Nepal have different protein coding regions in comparison with other countries, which has also
been represented in phylogenetic tree. So from the above perceptions it has been clearly verified
that India has the most diversified SARS-CoV-2 as it is having altered nucleotides at the viral
protein coding positions and also having different genomic sequence than others. After India,
Nepal might be harbouring the 2 most diverse species of SARS-CoV-2.

According to the previous research data, GWAS has been used vigorously in the field of genetic
variation studies and SNP analysis. The nearness of SARS-CoV-2 genomic information
empowers scientists for more investigation and examination on it, for example, the hereditary
variation examination and SNP seclusion, nucleotide varieties at the genomic positions have
been analyzed between the COVID-19 cases and control samples of Italian and Spanish cohorts
17

; between the symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 severity patients18; some genomic

mutational sites have been also identified in Europe and North America19; also the complete
genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 have been studied to understand the genomic structures and
the most common mutations within20. Apart from these the haplotype network analysis has also
been done on the genomic contents of Japanese people21. Before the isolation of SARS-CoV-2,
the nucleotide sequences of isolated SARS-CoV had compared and analyzed to identify the
positions of SNPs based on the genomic polymorphism 22. Also, the MERS-CoV genomes were
aligned and phylogenetically analyzed to identify the SNP variants 23.
The current investigation explores the potential varieties among the entire genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2, isolated from 11 different countries. The observed results in the
present study has identically urged some novel hereditary data including the nucleotide assorted
varieties, SNPs, mutations in particular protein coding districts of SARS-CoV-2 species. The
mutations might effected in the functional variability of viral genes or the virulence factors of
SARS-CoV-2, which reflects on the case fatality rates and mortality rates of respective countries.
These findings might be used in the development of a vaccine or drug candidates against
COVID-19 based on the different genomic architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in a greater extent. They
might also be able to predict the course of the disease or disease pattern in a particular country or
region of the world.

Conclusion
The whole world currently tangled in developing a novel vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Meanwhile, the above investigation is not just restricted to the genomic varieties, but also gives
the mutational consequences for protein-coding regions, which additionally be used for the
improvement of proper immunization candidates according to the genomic variability to conquer
the current world pandemic circumstances. This study might also be used as a prediction tool for
the disease behavior and expected infection fatality rate in a region or a country of the world.
Based on this study, the various countries may prepare or brace themselves by gauging on the
upcoming health care tsunami they are about to face.
