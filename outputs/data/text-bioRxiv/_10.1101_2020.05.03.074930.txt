Abstract
The recurrent and recent global outbreak of SARS-COV-2 has turned into a global concern
which has infected more than one million people all over the globe, and this number is increasing
in hours. Unfortunate no vaccine or specific treatment is available, which make it more deadly.
An immunoinformatics approach has shown significant breakthrough in peptide-based epitope
mapping and opens the new horizon in vaccine development. In this study, we have identified a
total of 15 antigenic peptides (including T and B Cells) in the surface glycoprotein of SARSCoV-2 which found to be 100% conserved with other SARS coronaviruses. Furthermore, the
population coverage analysis has found that CD4+ T-cell peptides showed higher cumulative
population coverage over to CD8+ peptides in the 16 different geographical regions in the world.
Notably, only 09 out of 15 peptides (LTDEMIAQY, IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG,
FAMQMAYRF, FGAGAALQ, VITPGTNTS, WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS) that have

80%  90% identity with experimentally identified epitopes of different organisms including
SARS-CoV and this will likely be beneficial for a quick progression of the vaccine design.
Moreover, docking analysis suggested that these peptides are tightly bound in the groove of HLA
molecules which can induce the T-cell response. Overall this study allows us to determine potent
peptide antigen targets in surface glycoprotein on intuitive grounds which open up a new horizon
in COVID-19 research. However, this study needs experimental validation by in vitro and in
vivo.

Introduction
History is witness to the fact that whenever a major disease comes, it brings tremendous
destruction with itself and these destructions are physical and economical. Previously, Cholera,
Smallpox, Bubonic plague and Influenza are some of the most brutal killers in human history and
killed millions of people all over the world. Nowadays, the world is scared of COVID-19, and its
outbreak continues to spread from China to all over the world, and we do not yet know when it
will stop. It is a contagious disease caused by SARS family virus named SARS-COV-2 which has
not been previously identified in humans. The initial symptoms of COVID-19 are coughing,
throat infection, fever, breath shortness, muscles pain and fatigue; most of the individuals (about
80%) recover without any special treatment but older people and a person with pre-existing
medical conditions (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lungs disease, and cancer) are more likely
to develop serious illness. The incubation period for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from

2  14 days after exposure(1).
In just four months, the COVID-19 that originally emerged from the Wuhan province of China
poses a major public health and governance challenges. The cases have now spread in 210
countries across all the continents. Till 10

 2020, more than 1.7   infected cases

with 100,000  deaths around the globe have been reported. At present, no vaccine or specific
treatment is available; however many drug companies are claiming to a developed vaccine like
India-based pharmaceutical firm Zydus Cadila has recently start DNA vaccine development
program against the COVID-19(2). Moreover, the Health and Human Services (HHS), USA,
Sanofi Pasteur and Johnson & Johnson have taken the initiative to develop vaccine and
therapeutics to use against COVID-19(3),(4). In a similar way, the Taiwan-based company
‚ÄúMedigen Vaccine Biologics Corp (MVC)‚Äù recently publicized that it has teamed up with the US
National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a vaccine against Covid-19(5).Currently, the
scientist of University of Oxford have opened up their COVID-19 vaccines for clinical trials (6).

However, Scientists are endeavouring to find drugs against COVID-19. There is many evidence
thus for has revealed many drug candidate including natural compounds, western medicines and
traditional Chinese medicines (TCN) that may have potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.
Morevere, other antiviral drugs like interferon Œ± (IFN-Œ±), lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine
phosphate, ribavirin, and arbidol are recommended as the tentative treatments COVID-19
induced Pneumonia(7). Currently, there is no specific treatment/medicine or vaccine to cure
COVID-19. So there is an urgent need to develop the new vaccines/drugs against COVID-19. In
this way, integration of computational techniques provides a novel approach for integrating
immunoinformatics approach for the development of vaccines. These methods had earlier been
used in the development of new vaccines against diseases like Dengue(8), Malaria(9),
influenza(10), Multiple sclerosis(11), and tumor(12). However, these approach generally work
through the identification of MHC-1 & II molecules and T‚ÄêCell epitopes (CD8+ &
CD4+)(13), which particularize the selection of the potential vaccine agents related to the
transporter of Antigen Presentation (TAP) molecules(14),(15).
In the current study, we have predicted epitope based vaccine candidates against the SARS-CoV2 using systematic immunoinformatics approach. We have considered surface glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2 due to its specific functions. Our work can save the time needed to screen a large
number of possible epitopes compared with experimental techniques and also guide the
experimental work with high confidence of finding the desired results in vaccine development.

Materials and methods
1. Sequence Retrieval and Analysis
The surface glycoprotein sequence (ID:- QHO62112.1) was obtained from NCBI gene bank
database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/) in the FASTA format. We also obtain the
secondary structure by using PSIPRED tool (16). It is well known fact that the Œ≤‚Äêsheet region of
the protein is more antigenic(17).

2. Identification of CD8+ T-Cell Peptides (Epitopes)
The identification of CD8+ peptides, The NETCTL_1.2(18) server was used at set threshold
value 0.95 to sustain the sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.95 respectively. We used all the
expanded 12 MHC‚ÄêI super types (including A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58
and B62) and incorporate the peptide prediction of     binding molecules and
Proteasomal C-terminal cleavage with TAP transports efficiency.

These results were

accomplished by weighted TAP transport efficiency matrix and then MHC-I binding and
proteasomal cleavage efficiency were used to obtain the total scores and translated it into the
sensitivity and specificity. We selected peptides as the epitope candidate on the basis of overall
score. Further, we check the peptides binding to     molecules by using MHC-I
binding predictions tool(19). The predicted output were given in units of IC50  (IC50 values

 50  = high affinity, IC50 500  moderate affinity and IC50  5000  low
affinity)(16). We chose those peptides (epitopes) only which have binding affinity  400 

for

the further analysis. Next, we check the probability of selected peptides for naturally processed
and tied with MHC molecule by using MHC-NP tool(20).

3. Identification of CD4+ T-Cell Peptide (Epitope)
CD4+ T--Cells play vital role in adaptive immune system and assist the other immune cell‚Äôs
activity. Besides, they indispensable in of B-Cell antibody class switching and affinity

maturation(21). The CD4+ T-cell peptides prediction emphases on the peptide-binding procedure
by MHC class II molecules(22). In our study, we have predicted a total of 162 possible peptides
with IC50‚â§100 ((IC50 values  50  = high affinity, IC50 500  moderate affinity and IC50

 5000  low affinity) by using MHC-II binding predictions tool(23).
4. B-Cell Peptides (Epitopes) Identification
The identification of B-cell peptides (Epitopes) in surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was
accomplished to find the potent antigen which gives an assurance of humoral immunity. Here,
we used Antibody Epitope Prediction tool(24) to find the B-cell antigenicity with classical
propensity scale methods including Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction 2.0(25), Chou &
Fasman Beta-Turn Prediction(26), Emini Surface Accessibility Prediction(27), Karplus & Schulz
Flexibility Prediction(28), Kolaskar & Tongaonkar Antigenicity(29) and Parker Hydrophilicity
Prediction(30). We selected that region in sequences (as the epitopic region) which were
commonly predicted as the epitopic region (above the threshold value) by all the above classical
method.

5. Epitope Conservancy and Immunogenicity Analysis
The epitope-conservation defined the degree of resemblance betwixt the peptide and query
sequences. Hence, we used Epitope Conservancy Analysis (ECA) tool(31) to find conservancy
of our peptides among the other SARS coronaviruses, Bat SARS like coronaviruses and Bat
coronaviruses. Additionally, the immunogenicity prediction can reveal the degree of efficiency
for individual peptides to produce an immunogenic response. In our study, we used Class I
Immunogenicity(32) tool to predict the immunogenicity of the MHC class-I binding peptides.

6. Peptide Structural Modelling and Retrieval of HLA-Molecules
The structure of CD+8 and CD+4 T-Cell peptides were modelled with an online server PEPFOLD 3.5(33). The structure of HLA molecules including HLA-B*53:01 (PDB ID: 1A1M)(34),
HLA-B*44:03(PDB ID: 4JQX)(35) and HLA-DRB1*01:01(1AQD)(36) were we retrieved from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB)(37). The structure of peptides and HLA molecules are depicted in
Figure 1.
7. Population Coverage Analysis (PCA)
The Population Coverage Analysis tool (38) gives the idea about probable response of each
peptide in different countries of the world based on peptide-HLA data genotypic frequency. Our
CD8+ T-cell (three peptides) and CD4+ T-cell (six peptides) peptides and their respective HLA
alleles were used for PCA. We selected 16 geographical areas (15 countries and 21 different
ethnicities grouped into 16 different geographical areas.) considered were East Asia, Northeast
Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, Europe, East Africa, West Africa, Central
Africa, North Africa, South Africa, West Indies, North America, Central America, South America
and Oceania.

8. Predicted Peptides vs. Epitope Database and Peptide Screening for Autoimmune, Allergic and
Toxic Response

In this section, we used predicted peptides (including T-cell and B‚Äìcell peptides) to search for
homologous epitopes at 80% to 90% identity in Epitope database(39),(40). This study helps to
check our peptide identity with human proteome because there is a chance of an autoimmune
response due to any kind of molecular mimicry between the predicted peptides (epitope) and the
human proteome. Next, we checked the allergic and toxic nature of predicted peptides using
AlgPred(41) and ToxinPred(42) tools respectively.

9. Molecular Docking Studies
In this study, molecular docking studies produced important information regarding the
orientation-pattern of the peptides in the binding groove of the HLA-molecules as well as which
residues are actively involved in the binding. In current, we used DINC 2.0(43) online server for
docking of peptides. In our study, we have selected three CD8+ T-cell peptides (LTDEMIAQY,
WTAGAAAYY and WMESEFRVY) and five CD4+ T-cell peptides (IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN,
VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF and FGAGAALQ) for docking against the HLA molecule
including HLA-B*53:01, HLA-B*44:03 and HLA-DRB1*01:01. The finest binding modes are
chosen through multiple parallel docking runs, and the corresponding fragments are expanded by
addition of few atoms. Now these extended fragments go for next level of docking, at this stage a
new subset of flexible degrees of freedom (DoFs) is generated. These flexible DoFs include few
‚Äúnew‚Äù atoms (red) and few ‚Äúold‚Äù atoms (blue). This progression remains until the full peptide
has been reassembled in its original structure.

Results
1. Sequence Retrieval and Structure Prediction
Viral glycoproteins have a major role in its pathogenesis. The main goal of viral infection is to
recognise and bind a receptor on cell surface of the host. It is considered as the surface
glycoprotein play important role in immunity and infection. We retrieved envelope surface
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-19 from the of NCBI gene bank database (ID: QHO62112.1). The
sequence is 1273 residues long. Additionally, we predicted the secondary structure of the protein
by using RaptroX tool(44) which contains Œ±-helix(19%), Œ≤-sheets(31%), random coil(48%) and
disordered region (4%). The solvent accessibility of a protein sequence (residues) is the surface
area of the residue that is accessible to a solvent; it plays a key role in spatial arrangement and

packing of the protein. So we calculated it and found that 36% region is exposed, 34% is buried
and 29% is medium region in the sequence. The complete details are given in Supplementary
Figure-1.
2. CD8+ T-cell Peptides
The NETCTL server predicted several peptides in SARS-CoV-19 surface glycoprotein but only
nine most potent peptides were chosen which have high combinatorial score. We considered
only those alleles of MHC-I class for which the peptides showed higher binding affinity
(50  400 !. Proteasomes played a key role to cleaving the peptide bonds and converting
the protein into peptide. The total score of each peptide‚ÄìHLA interaction was taken into
consideration and a greater score meant greater processing efficiency. The three peptides
LTDEMIAQY (P1), WTAGAAAYY (P2) and WMESEFRVY (P3) among nine were found to bind
with most of the MHC Class-I molecules, including HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*53:01, HLAA*68:02, HLA-B*44:03 and HLA-B*57:01 but peptides P1, P2 and P3 had maximum probable
value of 0.8203, 0.8185 and 0.7539 for the HLA-B*53:01, HLA-B*44:03 and HLA-B*44:03
respectively. These peptides (P1, P2 and P3) have also maximum identity #100%! for
conservancy. Moreover, we did immunogenicity prediction of peptides and get the highest
pMHC-I immunogenicity scores of 0.02757 (P1), 0.15259 (P2) and 0.14153 (P3). The details
are given in Table 1.

3. CD4 T-Cell Epitope
We identified

162 peptides with 50  100 but only six peptides (FVSNGTHWF, IRASANLAA,

FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, and FGAGAALQ) were found to be interacted with
most of the HLA-DRB-1 molecules, the details are given in Table 2.

4. B-Cell Linear Epitopes
The B-cell epitopes comprise of peptides which can easily be used to take the place of antigens
for immunizations and antibody production. In this study, we used an amino acid scale-based

method in B-cell antibody epitope prediction tool in which we predict linear epitopes from
protein sequence. We found six B-cell linear peptides (including LTPGDSSSGWTAG,
YQAGSTPCNGV, YGFQPTNGVGYQ, VITPGTNTSN, QTQTNSPRRARS and LPDPSKPSKR) in
the COVID-19 surface glycoprotein which may capable to inducing the desired immune
response as B-cell epitopes (Figure 2).
5. Population Coverage Analysis (PCA)
The population coverage analysis calculates the expected response of predicted peptides
(including MHC-I & II) in populations from different geographical areas. In this study, PCA for
16 different geographical areas was carried out for the predicted peptides by considering all the
MHC class-I & II molecules. The results suggested that the expected response of these peptides
is varying for populations residing in different geographical regions, shown in Figure 3. The tool
predicted average population coverage of 21.50% and 51.09% for MHC Class-I&II binding
peptide fragments respectively. The PCA of MHC class II binding peptide fragments of SARSCoV-19 surface glycoprotein revealed maximum population coverage e.g., 75.57%, 73.61% and

72.91% for North America, Europe and East Asia populations (The details are given in
Supplementary_Figure 2).
6. Autoimmune, Allergic and Toxic Response
In the past, there is many cases has been reported for the development of autoimmune diseases
like systemic lupus anemia, mysthemia gravis (hepatitis B), multiple sclerosis (swine flu),
diabetes mellitus (Mumps) and Gullian Barr syndrome (influenza and oral polio
vaccine)(45),(46). To avoid autoimmunity, it becomes important to discard those peptide agents
which are similar to human proteome. In the our study, we found good results, most of the
peptides (including MHC-I & II and B-cell peptides) were found to similar with experimentally
identified epitopes of SARS_COV (Spike Glycoprotein) except few (FVSNGTHWF,
LTPGDSSSGWTAG and YGFQPTNGVGYQ) which are resemble with human and other
pathogen‚Äôs proteome. Next, we have screened all the peptides to check their allergic and toxic
nature, all the peptides were found non-Allergen as well as non-toxic (Supplementary_Figure 3).

7. Peptide-HLA Interaction Analysis
To ensure the interaction between the CD+8 T-cell peptides (LTDEMIAQY, WTAGAAAYY and
WMESEFRVY) and HLA molecules (HLA-B*53:01(1A1M), HLA-B*44:03(4JQX) and HLAB*44:03(4JQX) respectively), we performed molecular docking analysis and found that
LTDEMIAQY bind with HLA-B*53:01 having binding affinity 6.70 %/ . Similarly,
WTAGAAAYY and WMESEFRVY bind with HLA-B*44:03 having binding affinity 6.50 %/

  and 7.90 %/  respectively (Figure 4). Moreover, all the CD+4 T-cell peptides were
binds into the groove of HLA-DR molecules (HLA-DRB1*01:01(1AQD)) with good binding
affinities e.g., 6.80 %/  (with IRASANLAA), 8.50 %/  (with FGAISSVLN),

Discussion
The development of vaccines refers to one of the most effective and cost-effective medical and
public health achievements of all time. This is a very lengthy, complex, and costly process and
requires an involvement of public and private combination. In each year, vaccination programs
save over three million lives. The peptide as a choice of vaccine agent has made astonishing
move towards vaccine design against the viruses, bacteria and cancer. The peptide vaccine is
often synthetic and mimics naturally occurring proteins from pathogens and these peptides based
vaccine have shown promising successful results in the past for disease like malaria, dengue,
multiple sclerosis, influenza. Besides of these diseases, peptide based vaccines have also been
developed against several types of cancer like colorectal cancer, myeloid leukaemia and gastric
cancer (47),(48),(49). The identification and design of immunogenic peptides (epitopes) is
expensive as well as time consuming. So immunoinformatics approach has made easy to identify
potent peptides. In the present study, we have identified CD8+ T-cell (three peptides), CD4+ T-

cell (six peptides) and B-cell linear peptides (six peptides) from SARS-CoV-19 surface
glycoprotein using immunoinformatics approaches but we were more emphasized to study T-cell
peptides because vaccines against T-cell epitopes are more promising as they evoke a longlasting immune response, with antigenic drift, an antigen can easily escape the memory response
of antibody(50),(51).
For the MHC class-I binding peptides, the immune response for the top five different
geographical regions

(highest population coverage range 30-34%) including South

Africa_33.78% (South Africa), West Indies_33.12% (Cuba, Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad and
Tobago), East Africa_32.25% (Kenya, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe), Central Africa_30.70%
(Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda and Sao
Tome & Principe) and East Asia_30% (Japan, South Korea and Mongolia). Similarly, for the
MHC class-II binding peptides, the excepted immune response was found to be remarkable
(PCA range 60%‚Äì76%) for North America (Canada, Mexico and the United States), Europe
(Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, France,
Georgia, Germany, Greece, Ireland Northern, Ireland South, Italy, Macedonia, Netherlands,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Serbia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Wales), East Asia (Japan, South Korea and
Mongolia), South Asia (India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), North Africa (Algeria, Ethiopia, Mali,
Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia) and West Indies (Cuba, Jamaica, Martinique, Trinidad and
Tobago). Thus, our results suggested that MHC class-II binding peptides may be potent vaccine
agents for different populations of the globe.
We know that vaccination is the utmost prevention of epidemiologic infectious diseases but it
has low incidence of serious systemic adverse effects (like autoimmune diseases). We have
predicted a total of 15 peptides (T-cell and B-cell) but seven peptides are very important
including

IRASANLAA,

FGAGAALQ and VITPGTNTSN

because their peptide fragments are matching with

coronavirus (SARS_CoV)(52‚Äì56). So these peptides can be used as vaccine agent against the
SARS_CoV-2. Besides, peptide WTAGAAAYY and QTQTNSPRRARS are similar with epitopes
of Human herpesvirus-4 (with major DNA-binding protein) and Bordetella pertussis (with
filamentous

hemagglutinin)

respectively

and

other

three

peptides

(WMESEFRVY,

YQAGSTPCNG and LPDPSKPSKR) were not found resemble with any organism‚Äôs proteome.
Hence, these peptides (say unique peptides) can also proposed as candidates for further studies in
the area of vaccines development, therapeutic antibodies and diagnostic tools against the SARS_CoV2. Other two peptides LTPGDSSSGWTAG and YGFQPTNGVGYQ which shown resembles with Mus
musculus (mouse) or Homo sapiens (human) proteome were eliminated from the study to avoid

autoimmunity risk.
As we know that HLA-alleles are polymorphic in nature; so peptide can interact with it. In our
study, MHC class-I binding peptides (8-9 residues long) are binds in the wide groove (~1.25√Ä)
of HLA molecules (HLA-B*53:01 and HLA-B*44:03). Peptide (LTDEMIAQY) bind with HLAB*53:01 by TRP-147, TYR-84, ARG-62 residues and surrounding residues which gives it
polymorphic nature lie at the interface of this helix and the bottom of the peptide-binding site,
namely at positions ASN-63, PHE- 67, and TYR-74. In docking with HLA-B*44:03, the
WTAGAAAYY and WMESEFRVY peptide got expanded conformation within the same trench and
both peptides were surrounded by polymorphic positions (TYR-9, THR-24 and LEU-163).
Further, we check the interaction of MHC class-II binding peptides with HLA-DR molecules.
All the five peptides are buried by interactions with the GLU-28, SER-53, TYR-60, ASN-62, ASP66, ASN-69, ARG-71, HIS-81 and ASN-8 and are preferred bind in the groove of HLA-DR
molecules. The docking studies suggested that these peptides are preferably bound into the
groove of respective alleles and can induce the CD+8 and CD+4 T-cell immunity.
Since, there is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19 and vaccine
development is a long way from being translated into practical applications. So at this crunch
situation, we have suggested that the predicted peptides would be capable to prompt an effective
immune response as a peptide vaccine against the COVID-19.

Conclusion
In our study, integrated computational approaches have identified a total of 15 peptides (T and B
cells) from SARS-CoV-19 surface glycoprotein, of which nine peptides resemble with
experimentally identified epitopes of SARS-CoV and other pathogen. Consequently, these
peptides may be used for synthetic vaccine design to combat with emerging COVID-19 at this
deadly situation. However, in vivo and in vitro, experimental validation is needed for their
efficient use as a vaccine candidate.

(A) The 3D structure of HLA molecules including HLA-B*53:01, HLA-B*44:03 and HLA-DRB1*01:01.
(B) The peptide structure of three peptides for CD8+ T-cells (LTDEMIAQY, WTAGAAAYY and
WMESEFRVY). (C) The structure of six CD4+ T-cells peptides including FVSNGTHWF,
IRASANLAA, FGAISSVLN, VKQLSSNFG, FAMQMAYRF, and FGAGAALQ.
Six Peptides representing the B cell epitopes which have highest antigenic propensity and
surrounded by six different coloured lines, each line indicating different analysis methods (Bepipred
linear epitope prediction, Chou & Fasman beta-turn prediction, Emini surface accessibility prediction,
Karplus & Schulz flexibility prediction, Kolasker & Tongaonkar antigenicity prediction and Parker
hydrophilicity prediction.) with the maximum scores.
Population coverage of the identified peptides in 16 geographical regions of the world: (i) Population
coverage represents the fraction of individuals expected to respond to a given epitope set, (ii)
Average number of epitope hits / HLA combinations recognized by the population and (iii) Minimum
number of epitope hits/HLA combinations recognized by 90% of the population (PC90).
(A) Peptide LTDEMIAQY binds in the groove of the HLA-B*53:01. Residues TRP-147, TYR-84 and
ARG-62 form regular hydrogen bonds. (B &C) Two epitopes WTAGAAAYY and WMESEFRVY bind
in the groove of the HLA-B*44:03. Residues which form hydrogen bond are GLN-155, TYR-99, ASN17, TRP-147 and THR-69, TYR-171, SER-167, TYR-99, TRP-147, GLU-76 respectively.
Five peptides including IRASANLAA(green), FGAISSVLN(magenta), VKQLSSNFG(yellow),
FAMQMAYRF(blue) and FGAGAALQI(red) bind in the groove of HLA-DRB1*01:01. Most of the
residues commonly form H-bond with all the peptides, e.g., GLU-28, SER-53, TYR-60, ASN-62, ASP66, ASN-69, ARG-71, HIS-81 and ASN-8.
