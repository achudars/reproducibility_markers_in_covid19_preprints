Abstract: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is an envelope
glycoprotein that binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 as an entry receptor. The capacity of
enveloped viruses to infect host cells depends on a precise thiol/disulfide balance in their surface
glycoprotein complexes. To determine if cystines in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein maintain a
native binding interface that can be disrupted by drugs that cleave cystines, we tested if thiol-based
drugs have efficacy in receptor binding and cell infection assays. We found that thiol-based drugs,
cysteamine and WR-1065 (the active metabolite of amifostine) in particular, decrease binding of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to its receptor, decrease the entry efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike
pseudotyped virus, and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 live virus infection. Our findings uncover a
vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to thiol-based drugs and provide rationale to test thiol-based drugs,
especially cysteamine and amifostine, as novel treatments for COVID-19.
Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a multidimensional disease characterized predominantly by
pneumonia that can progress to respiratory failure and death 1,2. The envelope glycoproteins of
SARS-CoV-2 include a spike glycoprotein trimer (SARS-2-S) that binds a cell surface protease
(angiotensin converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]) as an entry receptor 3. The viral envelopes of so-called
type I enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses, retroviruses, and filoviruses, exhibit similar
structural and mechanistic strategies for viral entry4. Among these viruses, the capacity of their
envelope glycoproteins to mediate fusion of virus to host cell membranes depends on a precise

thiol/disulfide balance in the viral surface glycoprotein complex 5–8. Natural and specific
thiol/disulfide rearrangements in this complex can trigger conformational changes that promote
virus entry 9–11, but removal of disulfide bridges by chemical reduction or by replacement of
cysteines by mutagenesis can also disrupt viral binding to prevent infection. For example, chemical
reduction of the S1 domain of SARS-CoV decreases its binding to ACE2 and inhibits transduction
of Vero E6 cells by SARS-CoV pseudovirions, and site-directed mutagenesis replacing
cystine forming cysteines with alanines in the SARS-COV spike (hereafter SARS-1-S) RBD
prevents binding of ACE2 6. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the binding
affinity of SARS-2-S RBD for ACE2 is significantly impaired when all of the disulfide bonds of
both ACE2 and SARS-2-S are reduced to thiol groups 12. Thus, there is consistent literature that
manipulation of the redox status of the cysteine-rich glycoproteins in viral envelopes can influence
or impair viral cell entry. Despite this, there have been no reported attempts to use thiol-based
drugs to cleave disulfide bridges as a direct anti-viral treatment strategy. Instead, the rationale to
use thiol-based drugs to treat viral infection has been based on the anti-oxidant and antiinflammatory properties of these drugs 13,14.
In this study, we considered the possibility that thiol-based drugs have direct anti-viral activity
against SARS-CoV-2 by modifying SARS-2-S so that it does not bind to ACE2. Thiol-based drugs
are distinct from sulfur-containing drugs, including sulfides (e.g. carbocysteine) or disulfides (e.g.
disulfiram) that do not have a free thiol warhead and cannot cleave disulfide bridges. Sulfides and
disulfides can form stable sulfur radicals and are good radical scavengers with antioxidant
properties, and some - like disulfiram - may also inhibit cysteine protease activity relevant for viral
replication 15. There are 11 currently approved drugs with at least one functional thiol group and
an additional three approved drugs whose active metabolite has a free thiol group (Table 1 and
Table S1). We screened 8 of the thiol-based drugs for efficacy as entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV2.
Results
Cystine bridge map of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
Using published data 16,17, we built a cystine bridge map of SARS-2-S and compared the amino
acid alignment of the receptor binding domains (RBDs) in SARS-2-S and SARS-1-S. We noted 7
cystine bridges in the SARS-2-S1 domain (Figure 1a) and 4 conserved cystines between SARS-1S and SARS-2-S RBD (Figure 1b). The conserved Cys467-Cys474 in SARS-1-S and Cys480Cys488 in SARS-2-S constrain the ACE2 binding domains, and previous studies with SARS-1-S
RBD have shown that mutagenesis of either homologous cysteine leads to loss of ACE-2 binding
6. To further explore if Cys480-Cys488 in SARS-2-S might be vulnerable to chemical cleavage,
we used protein modeling software to render the SARS-2-S RBD based on PDB entry 6M0J
(Figure 1C). This rendering shows that Cys480-Cys488 is very near the RBD surface (Figure 1c).
Effects of thiol-based drugs on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to ACE2
To test if thiol-based drugs can cleave cystines in the RBD of SARS-2-S to disrupt binding to
ACE2, we exposed the RBD to 8 thiol-based drugs and then quantified ACE2 binding affinity in
a plate-based binding assay. Carbocysteine was included as a negative control because it is a sulfur
containing drug lacking a free thiol warhead (Table 1). Amifostine is a phosphorothioate prodrug
whose dephosphorylated metabolite (WR-1065) is the active drug (Table 1 and Table S1).
Conversion of amifostine to WR-1065 in vivo requires phosphatases absent in plate-based assays,

and WR-1065 (available as a commercial reagent) was tested together with amifostine (as a second
negative control). The ACE2-SARS-2-S RBD binding assay was optimized by modifying a
commercially available kit. RBD was covalently coupled to plates functionalized with primary
amine-reactive maleic anhydride. ACE2 binding was then evaluated after RBD exposure to thiolbased drugs for 60 minutes (Figure 2a). We found that carbocysteine and amifostine had minimal
effects on RBD binding to ACE2 except at the highest doses. All of the thiol-based drugs inhibited
RBD binding to ACE2 in a dose dependent manner, but their potency varied. Penicillamine and
succimer had relatively weak inhibitory effects (Supplementary Figure S1), but 2-mercaptoethane
sulfonate, sodium salt (Mesna), bucillamine, cysteamine, and WR-1065 had much stronger effects
(Figure 2b,c), These data provide strong support for our hypothesis that thiol-based drugs cleave
cystine bridges in the SARS-2-S RBD to disrupt the native binding interface required for
interaction with ACE2. To explore the stability of this disruption, we measured binding of SARS2-S RBD to ACE2 at one and two hours post exposure to Mesna, bucillamine, cysteamine, and
WR-1065. We found that the robust binding inhibition effect of these four drugs was retained for
two hours after drug removal (Figure 2d), indicating that SARS-2-S cystines do not quickly reform after thiol-drug exposure.
Effects of thiol-based drugs on entry efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus
To test if thiol-based drugs can inhibit the entry mediated by SARS-2-S, we tested drugs in a
SARS-2-S pseudovirus entry assay. The pseudovirus particles carry SARS-2-S on the surface and
enclose a viral genome of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with a deleted
glycoprotein (rVSV-ΔG) and an insertion of the firefly luciferase gene. In these experiments, we
first exposed pseudovirus particles to thiol-based drugs and then quantified cell entry efficiency in
human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) stably transfected to express huACE2 and
transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2, a priming serine protease for SARS-CoV-2 3)
(293T-ACE2-TMRPRSS2 cells). As illustrated in Figure S2, the experimental protocol measured
SARS-2-S pseudovirus entry into 293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells in a condition where the virus was
first pre-treated with thiol-based drugs for 2 hours and a condition in which the 293T-ACE2TMPRSS2 cells was first pre-treated with thiol-based drugs for 2 hours before transduction with
the SARS-2-S pseudovirus. None of the drugs significantly affected cell viability, and pretreatment
of SARS-2-S pseudovirus with carbocysteine and amifostine did not inhibit viral cell entry (Figure
3a, b), but pretreatment of SARS-2-S pseudovirus with all of the thiol-based drugs significantly
decreased viral entry in a dose dependent manner (Figure 3c-h). WR-1065 and cysteamine were
particularly potent entry inhibitors with efficacy apparent in low millimolar doses (Figure 3g, h).
These data demonstrate that thiol-based drugs disable SARS-2-S and prevent it from interacting
with ACE2. In experiments where the 293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were pretreated with thiolbased drugs and infected with untreated SARS-2-S pseudovirus, only small and inconsistent
effects on pseudovirus cell entry were evident (Supplementary Figure S3).
Effects of thiol-based drugs on SARS-CoV-2 live virus infection.
To determine if thiol-based drugs inhibit entry of live SARS-CoV2 virus to host cells, we tested
the four most potent drugs in the plate-binding and pseudovirus assays in a live virus assay.
Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 virus was pre-treated for 2 hours with cysteamine, WR-1065, Mesna
and bucillamine before infection in Vero E6 cells. Carbocysteine was again used as a negative
control. We found that cytopathic effects (CPE) in virus-infected cells were inhibited by
cysteamine, WR-1065, Mesna and bucillamine but not by carbocysteine (Figure 4). The inhibitory

effects of WR-1065 and cysteamine were evident at micromolar concentrations of drug whereas
the inhibitory effects of Mesna and bucillamine required millimolar drug doses. Application of
thiol-based drugs to cells before infection with untreated SARS-CoV2 did not inhibit CPE
(Supplementary Figure S4).
Discussion
A major challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic has been to identify treatments that can address the
morbidity, mortality, and economic harm caused by this disease. Our review of the amino acid
sequence and crystal structure of SARS-2-S suggested that disulfides in the RBD maintain a native
binding interface for interaction with ACE2 and that disrupting this interface with thiol-based
drugs would be a rational and feasible antiviral strategy that could be delivered quickly. We
provide support for our hypothesis with data generated in a receptor binding assay, a cell entry
assay that utilizes SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped virus, and a live virus cell infection assay.
These different experimental approaches show that thiol-based drugs decrease binding of SARSCoV-2 spike protein to its receptor, decrease entry efficiency of pseudotyped virus, and inhibit live
virus infection. These findings uncover a vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to thiol-based drugs and
provide rationale to test currently available thiol-based drugs as novel treatments for COVID-19.
Our data demonstrate that cystines in the RBD of SARS-2-S maintain a native binding interface
that can be disrupted by thiol-based drugs to inhibit binding of SARS-2-S to ACE2 and decrease
virus entry. We suspect that thiol-based cleavage of Cys480-Cys488 explains the efficacy of the
thiol-based drugs as entry inhibitors of SARS-CoV2, because it is accessible at the RBD surface,
but we do not provide direct evidence for the critical importance of this cystine. Cleavage of the
other three cystines in the RBD could also allosterically modify the binding interface in ways that
decrease binding to ACE2. Also, other cysteine residues – Cys822 and Cys833 – flanking the S2
domain mediate membrane fusion of SARS CoV1 18 raising the possibility that thiol-based drugs
could inhibit membrane fusion. In this regard, it is notable that we observed a consistent rank order
for the efficacy of the different thiol-based drugs as virus entry inhibitors, and that WR-1065 and
Cysteamine were the two most potent inhibitors. The rank ordering generally followed the thiol
pKa values, with drugs with higher pKa (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) being least effective and drugs
with lower pKa (WR-1065 and cysteamine) being most effective. The pKa value determines the
fraction of active thiolate anion that participates in thiol-disulfide exchange at a given pH 19,20. The
potency of WR-1065 and cysteamine - both aminothiols - was especially notable in the cell-based
virus assays and not as prominent in the plate-based binding assay. The larger effect of WR-1065
and cysteamine as compared to other thiol drugs tested in the cell-based assays may be because
these two drugs more effectively cleave cystines in both S1 and S2 domains of the S protein to
inhibit both receptor binding and membrane fusion. It is also possible that mechanisms other than
cystine cleavage that are dependent on the presence of the positively charged amino groups are
contributing to the enhanced potency of these drugs in cell-based assays.
To our knowledge, this efficacy of thiol-based drugs as direct antiviral agents has not previously
been reported. Thiol-based drugs therefore represent a rational drug class to repurpose for testing
in COVID-19 clinical trials. The fact that these drugs prevent viral entry is particularly appealing,
because entry inhibitors prevent cell infection and interrupt active infection. Thiol-based drugs
have been used for decades for multiple disease indications and are well tolerated, even at high

doses (Table S1). It is particularly appealing to re-purpose cysteamine and amifostine as COVID19 treatments, because we show that micromolar concentrations of these dugs inhibit cell entry of
SARS-CoV2. Cysteamine is used to treat cystinosis, a lysosomal storage disease characterized by
cystine accumulation, and it is available in tablet (including extended release) and eye drop
formulations 21,22. Amifostine is used to treat complications of DNA-binding chemotherapeutic
agents, and the trihydrate form is available as a lyophilized powder that is reconstituted for
intravenous infusion 23. Our data provide strong rationale for clinical trials to test the efficacy of
cysteamine and amifostine for COVID-19. Possibilities include the oral administration of
cysteamine for less severe cases of COVID-19 or for post exposure prophylaxis and intravenous
administration of amifostine for treatment of more severe cases of COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Cells, plasmids and virus
HEK293T/clone17 (CRL-11268) and Vero E6 (CRL-1586) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle´s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The cells were obtained from ATCC and
incubated at 37oC and 5% CO2. MEXi 293E cells (IBA Lifesciences) were cultured in MEXi
culture medium (IBA Lifesciences) at 37oC, 5% CO2 and 125 RPM as described by the
manufacturer. The codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike gene was subcloned from pCG SARSCoV-2 Spike (provided courtesy of Stefan Pölhmann 3) into the EBNA-1 dependent expression
vector pTT5 for high-level expression in MEXi 293E cells. To boost cell surface expression of
SARS-CoV-2 spike for efficient pseudotyping VSV, the C-terminal 21 amino acid containing the
ER-retrieval signal (KxHxx) of spike was deleted. Plasmids for engineering lentiviral ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 expression constructs: pLKO5d.SFFV.dCas9-KRAB.P2A.BSD (a gift from Dirk
Heckl, Addgene plasmid) and pDUAL CLDN (GFP) (a gift from Joe Grove, Addgene plasmid).
SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was obtained from BEI resources and
passaged in Vero E6 cells. Confluent Vero E6 cells grown in T175 flasks were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 and the culture supernatant was collected when widespread cytopathic effect (CPE)
was observed. After filtration through 0.45 μm filters, the virus containing culture supernatant was
stored at -80°C in small aliquots.
Thiol-based drugs and thiol content determination
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and MESNA were the pharmaceutical formulations, with NAC
manufactured by American Reagent INC at 200mg/ml and MESNA by Baxter at 100mg/ml USP.
Cysteamine (MilliporeSigma), amifostine (MilliporeSigma), WR-1065 (MilliporeSigma) and
penicillamine (MP Biomedicals) were lyophilized powders that were solubilized as 500mM
concentrated stocks in water. Cysteamine and WR-2065 were at pH 5. Amifostine was at pH 7
which was adjusted to pH 5. To ensure that amifostine does not auto-dephosphorylate to WR1065, it was made fresh before the experiment each time. Bucillamine (MilliporeSigma) and
tiopronin (Spectrum Chemicals) were lyophilized powders that were solubilized as 500mM
concentrated stocks in equimolar NaOH to increase the solubility, and the pH was adjusted to pH
5. Carbocysteine (MilliporeSigma) and succimer (MilliporeSigma) were solubilized as 250mM
concentrated stocks in 500mM NaOH to increase solubility with pH adjusted to pH 5. Free thiol

content, and thus concentration of an active drug, was measured before every experiment using
Ellman’s Reagent, 5,5'-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (Abcam), with the molar
extinction coefficient of 14,150M-1cm-1 at 412nm24. Active drug concentration measured by
DTNB was within 85 to 99% of nominal drug concentration. The stocks were stored at –20oC and
discarded if the thiol content went below 85%. Drug concentrations reported in plate-binding and
viral entry assays are based on active drug concentration in stock.
Structure Rendering and Analysis
Space filling images and receptor distance calculations were performed using indicated PDB
entries with UCSF Chimera, developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and
Informatics at the University of California, San Francisco, with support from NIH P41-GM103311
25.
RBD to ACE2 plate based binding assay
Amine-reactive maleic anhydride-derivatized 96-well plates were obtained from Thermo
Scientific. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Receptor binding domain (aa 319-537, (RBD), biotinylated
soluble recombinant angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and Streptavidin-HRP were
purchased from ACRO Biosystems. TMB and stop Solution were purchased from Sera Care. Wells
of maleic anhydride plates were washed three times with 200 µl wash buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween‐
20, pH7.4), as will all following washes. One hundred microliters of 1 µg/ml RBD in coating
buffer (0.05M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer; pH 9.6) was added to each well and incubated
overnight at 4ºC, then washed. Plates were blocked with 2% BSA in wash buffer for 60 minutes
at 37ºC, then washed. Wells were incubated with 100µl of drugs at concentrations ranging from 0
to 20mM diluted in PBS, for 60 minutes at 37ºC. Negative controls included wells with no RBD
or no ACE2. After washing, 100µl ACE2-biotin were added at 0.06 µg/ml in dilution buffer (PBS
+ 0.5% BSA + 0.05% Tween-20) and incubated at 37ºC for 60 minutes. After washing, 100µl
streptavidin-HRP at 0.1µg/ml in dilution buffer were added to wells for 60 minutes at 37ºC. The
plates were washed three times and incubated at 37ºC for 10 minutes in 100µl of TMB. The
reaction was stopped with 0.5M hydrochloric acid stop solution and absorbance was read at 450
nm on a spectrophotometer plate reader. Absorbance readings, after subtracting from negative
control wells, were transformed to percent binding, with the wells containing no drug set as 100
percent binding.
To measure the stability of binding of cysteamine, WR-1065, Mesna and bucillamine, wells were
incubated with either drugs at 5mM for 1 hour, followed by three washes. ACE2 was then added
to the wells either immediately, after 60 minutes, or after 120 minutes. Wells waiting for ACE2
were filled with 200µl of dilution buffer. This was followed by the same steps to assess ACE2
binding as described above. For all binding assays, 4-6 independent experiments were carried out
for all drugs, with 2 replicates in each.
Production of pseudoviruses
Pseudoviruses bearing SARS-2-S were generated using recombinant VSVΔG-luciferase-based
viruses, which lack glycoprotein (G) gene and instead code for reporter gene firefly luciferase.
Briefly, MEXi cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2 Spike expression plasmid (pTT5 SARSCoV-2 S21), using PEI as described by the manufacturer. Mock transfection served as the ‘no
glycoprotein’ control. At 2-3 days post-transfection, the cells were inoculated with

VSVG/VSVΔG-luc at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3. After 6 hours of incubation, the
cells were washed twice with PBS by centrifugation and resuspended in culture medium containing
1% I1 anti-VSV-G hybridoma supernatant (ATCC CRL-2700). At 24hours post-infection, the
culture supernatant was collected by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter to
clear off cellular debris. The supernatant containing viral particles was aliquoted and stored at 80 °C until further use.
Establishment of HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (293T-ACE2TMPRSS2)
Engineering of lentiviral ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression constructs
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were cloned into separate lentiviral expression constructs. ACE2 was cloned
into pLKO5d.SFFV.dCas9-KRAB.P2A.BSD (a gift from Dirk Heckl, Addgene plasmid) by
replacing dCAS9-KRAB with new unique enzyme restriction sites (SpeI and NheI) and
subsequently inserting the ACE2 gene sequence into the expression construct downstream of the
SFFV promoter based on restriction enzyme cloning. TMPRSS2 was cloned into pDUAL CLDN
(GFP) (a gift from Joe Grove, Addgene plasmid). GFP was exchanged with a puromycin cassette
using enzyme restriction sites Mlul and XhoI to enable antibiotic selection in cell culture.
TMPRSS2 was inserted into the expression construct immediately downstream of the SFFV
promoter following the addition of unique enzyme restriction sites (SrfI and SalI). All cloning
steps were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
Production of lentiviral particles
Lentiviral particles for delivery of lentiviral ACE2 and TMPRSS2 vectors were produced using a
polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences, Inc) transfection protocol. Briefly, HEK293T cells were
transfected with three plasmids: lentiviral ACE2 or TMPRSS2 constructs, psPAX2, and VSVg, at
a ratio of 4:3:1 and a final DNA amount of 1.5 μg prepared in Opti-MEM (ThermoFisher). PEI
was added at a ratio of 3:1 PEI:DNA (4.5 μg PEI). The transfection mix was vortexed and
incubated for 15 min at RT and added to the cells. 16h post transfection, transfection medium was
replaced with standard culture medium, and cells were cultured for another 24h. Cell supernatants
containing the newly produced viral particles were then collected 48h post transfection.
Supernatants were centrifuged at 4°C and subsequently filtered using 0.22 µm vacuum filter units
(MilliporeSigma). The supernatants were then aliquoted and stored at -80°C.
Establishment of cells stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2)
To establish HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2
cells), 0.4 x106 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. The following day, cells were transduced with
lentiviral particles containing the ACE2 vector by adding 500 µl of lentiviral particles and 500 µl
culture medium per well. 48h post transduction, medium was replaced with blastidicin (BSD;
InvivoGen) selection medium at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml BSD. After 5 days of selection,
cells were transferred to 75 cm2 cell culture flasks for further expansion of cells stably expressing
ACE2. The process was then repeated to further transduce cells with TMPRSS2 lentiviral particles
and cells were cultured in antibiotic selection medium containing 10 g/ml BSD and 1 g/ml
Puromycin 48h post transduction. The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was confirmed by
Western Blot and compared to nontransduced cells.

293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were plated in black 96-well tissue culture treated plates (Greiner
Bio-one) 18 hours before the experiment. Two experimental strategies of pseudovirus pretreatment and cell pre-treatment were followed (Figure S2). For pseudovirus pre-treatment, the
pseudoviruses were pre-incubated with different concentrations (1.56 -100mM) of the thiol-based
drugs for 2 hours at 37oC, followed by 66-fold dilution with standard culture media. The cells were
then transduced with these pre-treated virions for 2 hours at 37oC. After the incubation, the virions
were removed and cells were cultured in standard culture medium. For cell re-treatment, the 293TACE2-TMPRSS2 cells were incubated with the different drug concentration (0.02 -1.5mM) for 2
hours at 37oC, 5%CO2. These concentrations reflect the 66-fold dilution of drugs when virus/drug
mix was incubated with the cells in the pseudovirus pre-treatment experiment. After incubation,
the media was removed and the cells were transduced with untreated pseudoviruses for 2 hours at
37oC. After the incubation, the virions were removed and the cells were cultured in standard culture
medium.
For both experimental conditions, at 18 hours post-transduction, the cells were lysed and luciferase
activity was measured using Promega luciferase assay system and Biotek Synergy H1 plate reader.
Data was normalized to the viral particles without any viral envelope protein. For each experiment,
luciferase reads of no drug control group was set as 100% and the relative transduction efficiencies
in the presence of thiol-based drugs were calculated. Three-four independent experiments were
carried out for each PV pretreatment and cell pretreatment strategies, with 12 replicates in each for
all the drug doses.
SARS-CoV-2 quantification
Titers of SARS-CoV-2 was measured by TCID50 using Vero E6 cells. Viruses were 10-fold serially
diluted in DMEM with 1% FBS prior to addition to cell monolayer in 96-well-plate. For each
dilution, viruses were added to 10 replicate wells at 100 μl per well. After two hours of infection,
cells were washed and cultured with fresh DMEM medium containing 1% FBS at 37˚C with 5%
CO2. Clear CPE was observed two days later. 50% endpoints were calculated with Reed and

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection
SARS-CoV-2 of 1.2 x 104 TCID50/ml was incubated with 2-fold serially diluted thiol-based drugs
at 37°C for 2 hrs. Virus-drug mixtures were diluted 12-fold before addition to Vero E6 cell
monolayer in 96-well-plate. For each drug concentration, virus-drug mixtures were added to 10
replicate wells at 100 μl per well. The final titer of virus added to cells was 1 x 10 3 TCID50/ml
(100 TCID50 per 100 ul per well in 96-well-plate). After two hours of infection, virus-drug
inoculum was replaced with fresh DMEM medium containing 1% FBS. Clear CPE developed after
two days of incubation at 37˚C with 5% CO2. The experiment was repeated thrice. Wells with
clear CPE were counted positive and percentage of positive wells for each concentration of tested
drugs were plotted. The effect of thiol-based drugs on Vero E6 cells during the two hours of SARSCoV-2 infection was evaluated by addition of 8.33 mM or 0.52 mM of each drug and 100 TCID50
SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously to Vero E6 cell monolayer in 96-well-plate. After two hours of
infection, cells were washed and then cultured with fresh DMEM medium containing 1% FBS at
37˚C with 5% CO2. Clear CPE developed two days post infection.

The cell viability was quantified using CellTiter-Glo2.0 assay (Promega) which measures cellular
ATP content, indicating the metabolically active cells. For all cell viability experiments, the
experimental protocol was the same as the main experiment except for the step of pseudovirus/live
virus infection. For cell viability measurement corresponding to pseudovirus experiment, 293TACE-TMPRSS2 cells were seeded in 96 well black plates 18 hours prior to the experiment. The
cells were then incubated with different concentrations (0.02 -1.5mM) of the thiol-based drugs for
2 hours at 37oC, followed by removal of the drugs and incubation of cells with standard culture
medium for 18 hours. The experiment was carried out thrice with 5-6 replicates for each drug.
These concentrations reflect the 66-fold dilution of drugs when pseudovirus/drug mix was
incubated with the cells in the pseudovirus pretreatment setting. For the cell viability measurement
corresponding to the live virus experiment, Vero E6 cells were incubated with different
concentrations of the drugs (0.03 - 8.33mM) in 1% FBS for 2 days. These concentrations reflect
the 12-fold dilution of drugs when virus/drug mix was incubated with the cells in the live virus
infection setting. The cell viability experiment on Vero E6 cells was carried out once with 10
replicates for each drug. For both cell viability experiments, post the respective incubations, the
plates and their contents were equilibrated at room temperature for 30 minutes before addition of
equal volumes of CellTiter Glo2.0 reagent. Afterwards, the contents were mixed on a plate shaker
to induce cell lysis. The plates were then incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes followed
by measurement of luminescence using Biotek plate reader. Luciferase reads of control-treated
cells was set as 100% and the relative viability of cells incubated in the presence of thiol-based
drugs was calculated.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of difference in loss of binding for each drug was calculated using an
ordinary one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's post hoc analysis. For analysis of the effects of
the different thiol-based drugs, area under the curve (AUC) was plotted 27 using Graphpad Prism,
and ordinary one -way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s posttest was performed. Data are presented
as mean ± SEM [* p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.0001]. IC50 of the drugs in pseudovirus
transduction and live virus experiments was determined using the non-linear regression fitting with
a variable slope. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version
8.4.2).

Figure 2. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 is inhibited by thiol-based drugs. Panel (a):
Schematic representation of the SARS CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 binding assay. RBD was covalently
coupled to plates functionalized with primary amine-reactive maleic anhydride. ACE2 binding
was then evaluated after RBD exposure to thiol-based drugs for 60 minutes. Panel (b) shows
percent of binding in the presence of the drugs (n = 4 - 6). Without drug treatment, the binding
was 100%, whereas treatment with the thiol-based drugs showed a decrease in the binding %
relative to no drug control. The X axis is scaled to log2. Panel (c) shows area under the curve
(AUC) analysis for effects of the thiol-based drugs on RBD to ACE2 binding. Reference AUC
was calculated from RBD to ACE2 binding with no drug control; dashed line represents 50% of
reference AUC. Panel (d) shows binding of RBD to ACE2 at one and two hours post WR-1065,
cysteamine, Mesna or bucillamine exposure and washout (n = 4 - 5). Data are mean ± SEM.
Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-hoc
analysis. Significance indicates differences from no drug control (c) or reference AUC (d). *p ≤
