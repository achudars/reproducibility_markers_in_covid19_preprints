ABSTRACT

20

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of an emergent severe respiratory disease

21

(COVID-19) in humans that is threatening to result in a global health crisis. By using genomic, sequence,

22

structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families

23

of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses

24

and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly

25

evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its

26

predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses

27

which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig

28

domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by

29

viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the

30

immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.

Introduction

35

Nidoviruses are an ancient group of lipid-enveloped viruses with non-segmented RNA genomes, which

36

are known to infect oomycetes and animals, including molluscs, arthropods and vertebrates (1). Among

37

them are the coronaviruses (CoVs) which possess the largest known monopartite RNA genomes and are

38

classified into four genera—Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and

39

Deltacoronavirus (2). Over the past two decades, Beta-CoVs, including the viruses responsible for

40

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in

41

2012, have emerged as significant local land global health concerns with economic consequences (3, 4).

42

Recently, a novel severe respiratory disease has emerged in humans (abbreviated COVID-19) (5, 6).

43

COVID-19 presents with a relatively long incubation period of 1-2 weeks followed by development of

44

fever, dry cough, dyspnea and bilateral ground-glass opacities in the lungs (7). In some patients, this can

45

proceed to fatal respiratory failure, characterized by acute lung injury (8) and acute respiratory distress

46

syndrome (9). Within several months of the first outbreak, there have been over 75,000 confirmed cases

47

with over 2,000 deaths of COVID-19 globally (https://www.who.int/docs/default-

48

source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200220-sitrep-31-covid-19.pdf). Due to the rapid spread and

49

potential severity of the disease, COVID-19 poses as a potential major threat to human health. A novel

50

coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, and phylogenomic analysis

51

has shown that it belongs to the same larger clade of Beta-CoVs as the SARS-CoV with a likely origin in

52

bats (5, 10, 11). Despite intense scrutiny, multiple proteins encoded by the SARS-related CoV (including

53

SARS-CoV-2) genome remain enigmatic. Here, we present a computational and evolutionary analysis to

54

show that one such mysterious protein, ORF8, and several others from Alpha- and Beta-coronavirus,

55

comprise novel families of immunoglobulin domain proteins, which might function as potential

56

modulators of host immunity to delay or attenuate the immune response against the viruses.

Materials and methods

59

Genome comparison analysis

60

We retrieved the SARS-related CoV genomes by searching against the non-redundant (nr) nucleotide

61

database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with the SARS-CoV-2 genome

62

sequence (NC_045512.2) as a query (12). The program CD-HIT was used for similarity-based clustering

63

(13). A multiple sequence alignment of whole virus genomes was performed by KALIGN (14). Based on

64

the MSA, a similarity plot was constructed by a custom Python script, which calculated the identity

65

between each subject sequence and the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence based on a custom sliding

66

window size and step size. Open reading frames of virus genomes used in this study were extracted

67

from an NCBI Genbank file.

68
69

Protein sequence analysis

70

To collect protein homologs, iterative sequence profile searches were conducted by the programs PSI-

71

BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST)(12) and JACKHMMER (15), which searched against the non-

72

redundant (nr) protein database of NCBI with a cut-off e-value of 0.005 serving as the significance

73

threshold. Similarity-based clustering was conducted by BLASTCLUST, a BLAST score-based single-linkage

74

clustering method (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html). Multiple sequence

75

alignments were built by the KALIGN (14), MUSCLE(16) and PROMALS3D(17) programs, followed by

76

careful manual adjustments based on the profile–profile alignment, the secondary structure information

77

and the structural alignment. Profile-profile comparison was conducted using the HHpred program (18).

78

The consensus of the alignment was calculated using a custom Perl script. The alignments were colored

79

using an in-house alignment visualization program written in perl and further modified using adobe

80

illustrator. Signal peptides were predicted by the SignalP-5.0 Server (19). The transmembrane regions

81

were predicted by the TMHMM Server v. 2.0 (20).

82
83

Identification of distinct viral Ig domain proteins

84

By using the protein remote relationship detection methods, we generated a collection of distinct Ig

85

domains from the Pfam database (21) and also from our local domain database. Then, we utilized the

86

hmmscan program of the HMMER package (22) and RPS-BLAST (12, 23) to retrieve the homologs from

87

viral genomes.

89

Molecular Phylogenetic analysis

90

The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT

91

w/freq. model (24). The tree with the highest log likelihood is shown. Support values out of 100

92

bootstraps are shown next to the branches (25). Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained

93

automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances

94

estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with the superior log likelihood value. A

95

discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (4

96

categories). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable. The tree is

97

drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The tree diagram

98

was generated using MEGA Tree Explorer (26)

99
100

Entropy analysis

101

Position-wise Shannon entropy (H) for a given multiple sequence alignment was calculated using the

102

equation:

103
104

P is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i, and M is the number of amino acid types. The Shannon

105

entropy for the ith position in the alignment ranges from 0 (only one residue at that position) to 4.32 (all

106

20 residues equally represented at that position). Analysis of the entropy values which were thus

107

derived was performed using the R language.

108
109

Protein Structure Prediction and Analysis

110

The secondary structural prediction was conducted using the Jnet (Joint Network) program (27). Jnet is a

111

neural network-based predictor which trains neural networks from three different types of profiles:

112

profile PSSM, profile HMM, and residue frequency profile. It generates a consensus secondary structure

113

with an average accuracy of 72% or greater.

114
115

The Modeller9v1 program (Sali and Blundell, 1993) was utilized for homology modeling of structure of

116

SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 using the SARS-CoV ORF7 (1xak_A) (28) as a template. Since in these low sequence-

117

identity cases, sequence alignment is the most important factor affecting the quality of the model

118

(Cozzetto and Tramontano, 2005), alignments used in this study have been carefully built and cross-

119

validated based on the information from HHpred and edited manually using the secondary structure

120

information. We generated five models and selected the one that had better model accuracy p-value

121

and global model quality score as assessed by ModFOLD6 online server (29). Structural analysis and

122

comparison were conducted using the molecular visualization program PyMOL (30). The structural

123

similarity search was performed using the DALI server (31).

Comparative genomics unveils fast-evolving regions of SARS-related CoV genomes

127

The host-pathogen arms-race has selected for a disparate complement of viral genes involved in

128

pathogenesis. These genes often rapidly diversify through recombination and mutations to keep up with

129

the evolution of host resistance. To identify proteins with potential pathogenic roles in COVID-19, we

130

conducted a comparative genomic analysis of the coronaviruses. Similarity plots show that the bat CoV

131

RaTG13 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 with no evidence for recombination between them (Figure

132

1 and Figure S1). SARS-CoV-2 also shows good similarity to two other bat viruses, CoVZXC21 and

133

CoVZXC45, first in the 5’ half of ORF1 and again after nucleotide number 20,000 of the genome.

134

However, the remaining part of ORF1 of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 show no specific relationship to these

135

viruses. This suggests a recombination event between the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13,

136

and probably another member of the SARS-related clade close to CoVZXC21 and CoVZXC45. In addition

137

to this major recombination event, we identified several smaller regions which might have undergone

138

recombinational diversification during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Figure S1). Notably,

139

many of them are clustered in three regions displaying extensive diversification, corresponding to the N-

140

terminal region of the ORF1a polyprotein, the Spike protein, and the uncharacterized protein encoded

141

by ORF8 (Figure 1 and Figure S1).

142
143

Identification of novel immunoglobin protein families in CoVs

144

Among these three fast-evolving proteins, we focused on the ORF8 protein as it is one of the so-called

145

accessory proteins, which does not participate in viral replication (32, 33), raising the possibility that it

146

might have a role in viral pathogenesis. It is a predicted secreted protein present only in some Beta-

147

CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2 but not the MERS-like clade. Profile-profile comparisons using a sequence-

148

profile built from the multiple sequence alignment of all available ORF8 proteins showed it to be

149

unexpectedly homologous to the membrane-anchored ORF7a protein from the same subset of Beta-

150

CoVs, and several proteins (variously annotated as ORF9 or ORF10) from a subset of bat Alpha-CoVs

151

(Figure 2A) (probability=94% of profile-profile match) (34). ORF7a is a known member of the

152

immunoglobulin (Ig) domain superfamily and is specifically related to extracellular metazoan Ig domains

153

that are involved in adhesion, such as ICAM (35, 36). The Beta-CoV ORF8, ORF7a and the Alpha-CoV Ig

154

domains display a classic β-sandwich fold with seven β-stands and share the characteristic pattern of

155

two cysteines which form stabilizing disulfide bonds with metazoan Ig domains (Figure 2A and Figure S2)

156

(37). However, they are unified as a clade by the presence of an additional pair of conserved disulfide-

157

bonding cysteines (Figure 2A). Nonetheless, there are notable structural differences between the three

158

groups of proteins. ORF8 is distinguished from ORF7a and Alpha-CoV Ig proteins by the loss of the C-

159

terminal transmembrane (TM) helix and the acquisition of a long insert between stands 3 and 4 with a

160

conserved cysteine which might facilitate dimerization through disulfide-bond formation (Figure 2A).

161

The homology model of ORF8, based on the structure of SARS-CoV ORF7a (pdb id:1XAK), suggests that

162

this insert augments a potential peptide-ligand binding groove that has been proposed for ORF7a

163

(Figure 2B and Figure S3). Hence, the emergence of the insert has gone hand-in-hand with the

164

acquisition of a modified interaction interface.

165
166

Besides these families, we identified a fourth family of Ig domains from the same Alpha-CoVs which

167

contain the above-discussed ORF7a/8-like Ig family (Figure 3A). These Alpha-CoVs typically possess one

168

or two paralogous copies annotated as either ORF4a/b or NS5a/b. From their sequences, these Ig

169

domains are not closely related to the ORF7a and ORF8 Ig domains (Figure S4). However, profile-profile

170

searches have shown that they are related to Ig domains found in the adenoviral E3-CR1 proteins

171

(probability: 90% of matching the Pfam CR1 Ig domain profile) (Figure S4). In these searches, they also

172

yield weaker hits to two other Ig domains, namely the poxviral decoy interferon receptors and human T-

173

cell surface CD3 zeta (Figure S4).

174
175

ORF8 is a fast-evolving protein in SARS-related CoVs

176

Phylogenetic analysis of ORF7a, ORF8 and Alpha-CoV Ig domains shows that each group represents a

177

distinct clade (Figure 2C). The tree topology of ORF7a mirrors that of the polymerase tree (Figure 3A);

178

however, the topology of the ORF8-Ig clade is not consistent with it. This might be due to a

179

recombination event between the SARS-related CoVs (as suggested by the similarity plot analysis)

180

and/or unusual divergence under selection. To better understand the functional difference between

181

ORF8 and ORF7a, we examined the column-wise Shannon entropy in the 20 amino acid alphabet and

182

found that the ORF8 has significantly higher mean entropy than ORF7a (ORF8: 1.09 vs ORF7a: 0.22, p<

183

10-16 for the H0 of congruent means by t-test) (Figure 2D). By comparing column-wise entropies in both

184

the 20 amino acid and a reduced 8-letter alphabet (where amino acids are grouped based on similar

185

side-chain chemistry), we found at least 14 positions in ORF8 which show high entropy in both alphabets

186

as compared to a single position in ORF7a (Figure 2D). This indicates that ORF8 is a fast-evolving protein

187

under selection for diversity as contrast to ORF7a. Strikingly, one of these highly variable positions,

188

which features residues with very different side characters (hydrophobic, acidic, alcoholic and proline),

189

corresponding to Leu84 was also identified as the most variable position across 54 closely related

190

human SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (38). In our structural model, this residue is positioned at the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.977736; this version posted March 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

191

predicted peptide-ligand binding groove of the ORF8-Ig domain (Figure 2B). Therefore, our entropy and

192

structural analysis of the ORF8-Ig domain, in conjunction with its hypervariable position found in human

193

SARS-CoV-2 genomes, points to a role for ORF8 at the interface of the host-virus interaction possibly in a

194

pathogenic context.

195
196

Ig domain proteins are newly acquired in subsets of Alpha- and Beta-CoVs

197

We examined the distribution of CoV Ig proteins in the context of a phylogenetic tree of both Beta-and

198

Alpha-CoVs based on their polymerase proteins (Figure 3A). Other than the two subsets of Beta-CoVs

199

and Alpha-CoVs that contain the above-described Ig domain proteins, no other CoVs contain any Ig

200

domain proteins (Figure 3A). The immediate sister-groups of the Ig-containing CoVs typically have Spike,

201

E, M and N, and one or two other uncharacterized accessory proteins which are not Ig domains to our

202

best knowledge. The Alpha-CoV ORF9/10 share a C-terminal TM helix and, along with ORF7a of the Beta-

203

CoVs, lack the insert in the Ig domain (Figure 2A). Hence, it is possible that this architecture represents

204

the ancestral state which was present in the common ancestor of both Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs.

205

Under this scenario, the protein was displaced/lost both in certain Alpha-CoVs and Beta-CoVs.

206

Alternatively, ORF7a could have been exchanged between Alpha- and Beta-CoVs by a recombination

207

event. In both scenarios, ORF8 arose likely via a duplication of ORF7a in specifically the Beta-CoVs.

208

Although we couldn’t identify the ultimate precursors of the CoV Ig domains, they are likely to have

209

been acquired on at least two independent occasions from different sources. The CoV ORF7a-ORF8

210

families might have derived from the metazoan adhesion Ig families, and the ORF4a/b-like Ig domains of

211

Alpha-CoVs were likely acquired from adenoviral CR1 Ig domains with which they share some specific

212

sequence features.

213
214

Divergent Ig proteins with a comparable architecture are deployed by distinct viruses

215

The presence of multiple Ig domains with different affinities in CoVs prompted us to more generally

216

survey animal viruses for Ig domains. By using the Pfam models (39) and our own PSSMs created from

217

PSI-BLAST runs with Ig domains (12), we were able to identify about 17 distinct viral Ig domain families

218

in a wider diversity of animal viruses (Figure 3B and Table S2). In addition to CoVs, such Ig domain

219

proteins can be found in adenoviruses, NCLDVs, Herpesviruses and Phenuiviruses. These viral Ig domains

220

are highly divergent; many of them are only found in certain viral groups. However, the majority have an

221

architecture comparable to the CoV-Ig domains, with an N-terminal signal peptide, one or multiple Ig

222

domains and a C-terminal TM region often followed by a stretch of basic residues. Thus, although the Ig

223

domains are not the universally preserved component of viruses, they have been acquired and selected

224

independently by a wide range of viruses. The presence of a proofreading 3’-5’ exonuclease has been

225

proposed to favor the emergence of larger RNA genomes in CoVs (40). Indeed, this might have also

226

contributed to the acquisition of potential pathogenesis factors such as the Ig domains described herein

227

which are comparable to those seen in DNA viruses.

228
229

Novel CoV Ig domain proteins are potential immune modulators

230

Why have diverse viruses independently acquired the Ig domain during their evolution? First, the Ig

231

domains are major mediators of adhesive interactions in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes (37, 41, 42).

232

Thus, this domain can be used for adherence for cell to cell spread (e.g. herpesviral Ig domain proteins)

233

(43). Further, Ig domains are major building blocks of metazoan immune systems. Thus, viruses often

234

utlize this domain to disrupt immune signaling of the host. For example, in adenoviruses, the CR1 Ig

235

domain proteins have been shown to block the surface expression on infected cells of class I major

236

histocompatibility complex molecules by blocking their trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)

237

to Golgi (44). This has been shown to affect the host inflammatory response and modulates the

238

presentation of viral antigens to T-cells (45). In poxvirus, the secreted Ig domain proteins function as

239

interferon receptors or decoys that bind the interferon-α/β and disrupt signaling via the endogenous

240

host receptors (46). Further, SARS-ORF7a has been implicated in the interaction with bone marrow

241

stromal antigen 2 (BST-2), which tethers budding virions to the host cell in a broad-spectrum antiviral

242

response, to prevent the N-linked glycosylation of BST-2 thereby crippling the host response against the

243

virus (47). Given their shared evolutionary history and similar sequence and structural features, we

244

predict that the newly identified CoV Ig domain proteins, such as ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2, might similarly

245

function as immune modulators.

246
247

While ORF8 is a paralog of ORF7a, its lack of the TM segment, unique insert and significantly more rapid

248

evolution suggest that it has acquired a distinct function and has been under strong positive selection

249

One possible mechanism is that, like the adenoviral CR1 proteins, it interferes with MHC molecules to

250

attenuate antigen presentation, resulting in ineffective detection of the virus by the host immune

251

system. Consistent with this, the SARS-CoV ortholog translocates to the ER (48) and its higher variability

252

indicates probable selection due to its interaction with a rapidly evolving host molecule. Notably, while

253

the SARS-CoV ORF8 isolates from civets and early stages of the human epidemic are intact, it split up

254

into two ORFs (ORF8a and ORF8b) during the subsequent human epidemic (49). ORF8a and ORF8b

255

retain the conserved Cys residues of the Ig domain and have been observed to form a complex in a

256

yeast-two hybrid interaction study (50). This suggests it might still fold into an intact structure held by

257

the two disulfide bonds formed by four conserved Cys residues.

258
259

In conclusion, the presence of fast-evolving ORF8 Ig domain proteins in the SARS-related viruses,

260

including the emergent 2019 SARS-CoV-2, suggests that they might be potential pathogenicity factors

261

which counter or attenuate the host immune response and might have facilitated the transmission

262

between hosts. We hope that the discovery and analyses of the novel Ig domain proteins reported here

263

will help the community better understand the evolution and pathogenesis mechanisms of these

264

coronaviruses.

277

Similarity plot of SARS-related CoVs against human SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (NC_045512.2),

278

based on a multiple sequence alignment of the whole genomes. Each point represents the percent

279

identity of a 200 bp window of the alignment with a 50 bp step size between each point. The open

280

reading frames of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) are shown above the plot. Each colored line

281

corresponds to the nucleotide similarity between the human SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) and

282

the respective SARS-related CoV genome. The red arrows and dashed line surround a region displaying

283

major divergence due to possible recombination within SARS-related CoV genomes. The regions marked

284

by a solid red line highlight fast-evolving regions among the SARS-related CoV genomes. For detailed

285

information about the genomes that were used in this study, refer to Table S1.

Figure 2. Sequence, structure and evolutionary analysis of novel Ig domain proteins in SARS-related

288

CoVs.

289

(A) Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and representative domain architectures of ORF7a-Ig, ORF8-Ig,

290

and ORF7a/8-like Ig domain families. Each sequence in the MSA was labelled by its species abbreviation

291

followed by its source. The predicted secondary structure is shown above each alignment and the

292

consensus is shown below the super-alignment, where h stands for hydrophobic residues, s for small

293

residues, and p for polar residues. Two pairs of conserved cysteines that form disulfide bonds are

294

highlighted in red. (B) Homology model of SARS-CoV-2 ORF8-Ig domain (YP_009724396.1) and the

295

location of the hypervariable position corresponding to Leu84 in the predicted ligand-binding groove.

296

The β-sheets of the common core of the Ig fold are colored in blue, the insert in ORF8-Ig in orange and

297

the loops in grey. The characteristic disulfide bonds are highlighted in yellow. (C) Maximum likelihood

298

phylogenetic analysis of CoV Ig domain families. Support values out of 100 bootstraps are shown for the

299

major branches only. (D) Entropy plot for the ORF7a and ORF8 proteins in betacoronavirus. Left:

300

Shannon entropy computed for each column for a character space of 20 amino acids and presented as

301

mean entropy in a sliding window of 30 residues. The mean entropy across the entire length of the

302

protein is indicated as a green horizontal line. Right: Shannon entropy in regular amino acid alphabet (20

303

amino acids) are shown above the zero line in shades of orange. Shannon entropy in a reduced alphabet

304

of 8 residues are shown below the zero line in shades of blue. If a position shows high entropy in both

305

alphabets it is a sign of potential positive selection at those positions for amino acids of different

306

chemical character.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Supplementary Figure S1. Genome comparison analysis of SARS-related CoVs.

Similarity Plot of SARS-related CoVs against human SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (NC_045512.2)
based on a multiple sequence alignment of the whole genomes. Each point represents a different slicing
window size from the alignment with a different step size between each point. For each plot, the
window size and step size are shown in the top left. Horizontal bars above the top plot correspond to
the different open reading frames of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2). Each different colored line
corresponds to the nucleotide similarity between the human SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) and
the respective SARS-related CoV genome. The red arrows and solid lines surround regions which display
recombination within the SARS-related CoV genomes. The single red arrows point to specific regions of
recombination.

Supplementary Figure S2. Full length multiple sequence alignment of ORF7a, ORF8-Ig and ORF7a/8-like proteins.
Each sequence in the MSA was labelled by its species abbreviation followed by its isolation and NCBI accession number. The predicted secondary
structure is shown above the alignment and the consensus is shown below the alignment, where h stands for hydrophobic residues, s for small
residues, and p for polar residues. The characteristic signal peptide, TM region and a stretch of basic residues are also labeled.
