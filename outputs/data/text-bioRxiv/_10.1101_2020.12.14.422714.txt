Abstract: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can cause
neurological disease in humans, but little is known about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection
in the central nervous system. Herein, using K18-hACE2 mice, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2
neuroinvasion and encephalitis is associated with mortality in these mice. Intranasal infection of K18hACE2 mice with 105 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after
infection. The highest virus titers in the lungs were observed at day 3 and declined at days 5 and 6
after infection. In contrast, very high levels of infectious virus were uniformly detected in the brains
of all the animals at days 5 and 6. Onset of severe disease in infected mice correlated with peak viral
levels in the brain. SARS-CoV-2-infected mice exhibited encephalitis hallmarks characterized by
production of cytokines and chemokines, leukocyte infiltration, hemorrhage and neuronal cell death.
SARS-CoV-2 was also found to productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory
bulb, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain by this route after intranasal infection. Our data
indicate that direct infection of CNS cells together with the induced inflammatory response in the
brain resulted in the severe disease observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in humans can cause
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, cytokine storm syndrome and
death [1,2]. Although SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily causes respiratory disease; some patients
develop symptoms of neurological disease, such as headache, loss of taste and smell, ataxia,
meningitis, cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, seizures and impaired consciousness [3-10]. SARSCoV-2 infection also induces long-term neurological sequelae in at least one-third of human cases.
Infection with other coronaviruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in mice, and SARS-CoV-1
and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in humans have been shown to cause neurological
disease [11,12]. However, little is known about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2-associated
neurological disease in humans.
Central nervous system (CNS) cells that express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), include neurons, glial cells and astrocytes [13,14]. ACE2 is expressed

in multiple human brain areas, including the amygdala, cerebral cortex and brainstem with the
highest expression levels found in the pons and medulla oblongata in the brainstem that contain the
medullary respiratory centers of the brain [8,15]. Several human autopsy reports have documented
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in brain tissues [16,17]. Human iPSC derived neural progenitors
cells (NPCs) have been shown to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection and both viral proteins and
infectious viral particle production were detected in neurospheres and brain organoids infected with
SARS-CoV-2 [18,19]. Human autopsy reports have shown evidence of lymphocytic panencephalitis,
meningitis and brainstem perivascular and interstitial inflammatory changes with neuronal loss in
COVID-19 patients [20]. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can productively infect human CNS
cells [21]. However, the contributions of CNS cell infection and induced neuroinflammation to the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated disease are not well understood.
Small animal models provide a means for studying the neurological complications associated
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. It was recently reported that intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2
results in a rapidly fatal disease in K18-hACE2 mice [22-25]. These studies were focused on describing
the acute lung injury in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice that was associated with high levels
of inflammatory cytokines and accumulation of immune cells in the lungs [22-25]. In these published
studies, infectious virus or viral RNA was not detected in the olfactory bulbs or brains of the majority
of the infected animals, indicating restricted neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice. In the
present study, we show that intranasal infection of six-week-old K18-hACE2 mice by SARS-CoV-2
can cause severe neurological disease with the brain being a major target organ for infection by this
route of infection and neuroinflammation and neuronal death contributing to the infection-associated
morbidity and mortality. The data also suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 can be trafficked to the brain via
the olfactory bulb with subsequent transneuronal spread, as has been reported for other
coronaviruses [26,27].
2. Materials and Methods
Mice
Hemizygous K-18 hACE2 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
All the animal experiments were conducted in a certified animal biosafety level-3 (ABSL-3) laboratory
at the Georgia State University (GSU). The protocol was approved by the GSU IACUC (Protocol
number A20044). Six-week-old hemizygous K-18 hACE2 mice were infected with 105 plaque-forming
units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 under ABSL-3 containment by intranasal
inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) was isolated from an oropharyngeal swab from a patient
in Washington, USA (BEI NR-52281) [28]. Animals in the control group received equivalent amounts
of sterile PBS via the same route. Roughly equal numbers of male and female mice were used.
Animals were weighed and their appetite, activity, breathing and neurological signs assessed twice
daily [29,30]. Mice that met the human endpoint criteria were euthanized to limit suffering. In
independent experiments, mice were inoculated with PBS (Mock) or SARS-CoV-2 intranasally, and
on days 1, 3, 5 and 6 after infection, animals were anesthetized using isoflurane, perfused with cold
PBS and respiratory (nasal turbinate and lung) and other tissues (spleen, heart, liver, kidney,
pancreas, eye, olfactory bulb and brain) were collected and flash frozen in 2-methylbutane (Sigma,
St. Louis, Missouri, United States) [31-33]. Alternatively, mice were perfused with PBS followed by
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and tissues were harvested, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (Sigma, St.

Louis, Missouri, United States), and embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) as described
previously [31,34].
Quantification of the virus load
The virus titers were analyzed in the tissues by plaque assay and quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) [28,29]. Briefly, frozen tissues were weighed and homogenized in a bullet blender (Next
Advance, Averill Park, New York, United States) using glass or zirconium oxide beads. Virus titers
in tissue homogenates were measured by plaque assay using Vero cells. Quantitative RT-PCR was
used to measure viral RNA levels using primers and probes specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N gene as
described previously [28]. Viral genome copies were determined by comparison to a standard curve
generated using a known amount of RNA extracted from previously titrated SARS-CoV-2 samples.
Frozen tissues harvested from mock and infected animals were weighed and lysed in RLT buffer
(Qiagen) and RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA).
Total RNA extracted from the tissues was quantified, normalized and viral RNA levels per µg of total
RNA were calculated.
Measurement of cytokines, chemokines and interferons
The levels of mRNA for select cytokines/chemokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, CCL2 and
CCL3) and interferon-α (IFN-α) were determined in total RNA extracted from the lungs and brain
using qRT-PCR. The fold-change in infected tissues compared to mock tissues was calculated after
normalizing to the GAPDH gene [31,34]. The primer sequences and annealing temperatures used for
qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1. The protein levels of IFN-α were measured in the lung and brain
homogenates using an ELISA kit (PBL Interferon Source, Piscataway, NJ, USA) [29,30].

Immunohistochemistry
Sagittal sections (10-µm thick) were cut from the hemi-brain tissues frozen in OCT. Tissue
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological evaluation [34,35].
Additionally, tissue sections were incubated with anti-CD45, anti-NeuN and anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Norcross, GA, USA) overnight at 4°C followed by
incubation with Alexa Fluor 546- or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at room
temperature [31,34]. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining was conducted using an in-situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, United
States) as per the manufacturer’s instructions [31,34]. Images were acquired using the Invitrogen™
EVOS™ M5000 Cell Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Norcross, GA, USA).
Statistical Analysis
An unpaired Student’s t-test was used to calculate p values of significance. Differences with P
values of <0.05 were considered significant.
3. Results
Characteristics of K18-hACE2 mice following SARS-CoV-2 infection by the intranasal route
Six-week-old K18-hACE2 mice of both sexes were infected intranasally with PBS (mock, n=10
mice) or 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in PBS (n=20 mice). The mock-infected mice remained healthy
throughout the observation period.

Virus infection resulted in 100% mortality by day 6 after

infection (Figure 1A). Infected mice experienced significant weight loss on days 4 through 6 after
infection compared to the mock-infected group (Figure 1B). Starting on day 4, all the infected animals
began to show signs of disease, such as lethargy, slow movement and labored breathing.
Neurological symptoms, such as hunchbacked posture, ruffled fur, tremors and ataxic gait, were also
observed in infected mice on days 5 and 6 after infection.
Virus replication in the periphery and brain of K18-hACE2 mice
Six-week-old K18-hACE2 mice of both sexes were infected intranasally with PBS (mock, n=12
mice) or 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in PBS (n=20 mice) and groups of 5 mice were used to measure the
viral loads in the peripheral organs and brain at early (day 1), middle (day 3) and late (days 5 and 6)
stages of infection. High virus levels were observed in the lungs on day 1, reached peak levels at day
3 and declined at days 5 and 6 after infection (Figures 1C and 1D). In contrast, virus was not detected
in the brain on day one but was present by day 3 after infection. Very high levels of viral RNA and
infectious virus were detected in the brains of all the animals by days 5 and 6 after infection (Figures
1E and 1F). The onset of neurological symptoms and mortality in infected mice correlated with peak
virus titers in the brain.

by a decline at later stages of infection (days 5 and 6) (Figure 2). In the olfactory bulbs and eyes, low
levels of viral RNA were detected on days 1 and 3 after infection, with very high levels of viral RNA
detected in all the animals on days 5 and 6 after infection indicating productive infection within the

olfactory system (Figure 2). In contrast, little if any virus was detected in the serum of infected mice
at any time after infection tested.
Since the K18 promoter is known to be active in the epithelium of multiple organs of K-18-hACE2
mice [27,36], we also evaluated viral RNA levels in other peripheral organs. Viral RNA was detected
in the heart, kidney, spleen, pancreas and liver on days 1 and 3. There was a slight increase in RNA
levels on days 3 and 5 in each of these organs, suggesting limited virus replication at these sites
(Figure 2). These data agree with previous reports that also showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in these organs [22-25,27,36].

turbinates, olfactory bulbs, eye, serum, kidney, spleen, pancreas, heart and liver was determined on
days 1, 3, 5 and 6 after infection by qRT-PCR and expressed as genome copies/µg of RNA. Each data
point represents an individual mouse. The solid horizontal lines signify the median.
Inflammatory changes in the lungs and brain of SARS-CoV-2-infected mice
IFN signaling has a pivotal role in developing an innate and adaptive immune response to viral
infection [37,38]. Therefore, we measured the mRNA and protein levels of IFN-α in the lungs and
brain. In the lungs, an increase in both IFN-α mRNA and protein levels was detected on day 1, peaked
at day 3 and then decreased on day 6 after infection (Figures 3A and 3B). In contrast, an IFN response
was not detected in the brain on days 1 and 3 after infection. High levels of IFN-α were detected in
the brain only by days 5 and 6 after infection (Figures 3C and 3D). Overall, the induction of IFN-α
correlated with the SARS-CoV-2 replication kinetics in the lungs and brain. It is interesting to note

that relative IFN-α levels were comparatively higher in the lungs compared to the brains of the
infected animals despite higher virus replication in the brain.

Figure 3. Analysis of mRNA and protein levels of IFN-α in the lungs and brain. The mRNA levels
of IFN-α were measured in the lungs (A) and brain (C) by qRT-PCR, and the fold change in the
infected tissues compared to the corresponding mock-infected controls was calculated after
normalizing to the GAPDH gene. The protein levels of IFN-α were measured in the lungs (B) and
brain (D) homogenates using ELISA and expressed as pg/g of tissue. Error bars represent SEM (n = 5
mice per group). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.001.
We next examined the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lungs
and brain of infected mice. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in a 10-fold increase on day 1 and a 100fold increase on day 3 in the IL-6 mRNA expression in the lungs (Figure 4A). The levels of TNF-α
mRNA were elevated ~10-fold in the lungs on day 1 and 3 after infection. The level of IFN-γ mRNA
was elevated by 15-fold on day 3. However, the levels of these cytokines had decreased by day 5
after infection. The IL-1β mRNA levels showed no significant increase at any time point after
infection. There was a 100-fold increase in the expression of CCL2 on day 3 (Figure 4B). However, the
levels of CCL2 mRNA had decreased by day 5 after infection. CCL3 mRNA levels increased slightly
on day 1 and were undetectable at days 5 and 6 after infection.
In the brain, no increase in the mRNAs of the cytokines or chemokines tested was observed on
day 1 after infection. Less than a 10-fold increase was observed in the cytokine mRNA levels on day

3 (Figures 4C). There was a 500-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA by day 5 after infection. TNF-α and IFNγ mRNA levels increased by ~ 750-fold in the brain by day 5 after infection. Similarly, IL-1β mRNA
levels increased by 400-fold by day 5 after infection. Both CCL2 and CCL3 mRNA levels were
elevated by almost 1,000-fold on days 5 and 6 after infection and consistent with the high level of
virus in the brain (Figure 4D). These results indicate that the inflammatory response was more
pronounced in the brain than in the lungs at the later stage of infection.

Figure 4. Cytokine and chemokine mRNA level in the lungs and brain. The mRNA levels of various
cytokine and chemokine genes were determined in the lungs (A and B) and brain (C and D) using
qRT-PCR. Fold change in the infected tissues compared to the corresponding mock controls was
calculated after normalizing to GAPDH mRNA in each sample. Error bars represent SEM (n = 5).
SARS-CoV-2 induced neuropathology in K18-hACE2 mice
We next analyzed the brain sections from infected mice for antigen distribution, infiltration of
immune cells and cell death. Immunohistochemical staining for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
detected cell-associated viral antigen throughout the brain at day 6 after infection. Representative
data for sections from the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus regions are shown in figure 5. We
also detected virus antigen in sections of the olfactory bulb of infected animals on day 6. H&E staining
of brain sections from the infected mice demonstrated perivascular hemorrhage and neuronal cell
death (Figures 6A and 6B). The neurons of infected mice demonstrated shrunken neuron body with
light pink cytoplasmic staining representing degenerating neurons (Figure 6B). Enhanced leukocyte
infiltration was detected within blood vessel walls and in the perivascular space (Figure 6A).

Evidence of leukocyte infiltration was confirmed by direct immunohistochemical analysis of the
CD45 antigen, which revealed many CD45-positive cells in the brain parenchyma near neurons
(Figure 6C). SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death was evaluated by direct TUNEL staining of brain
tissues. On day 6, infected K18-hACE2 mice had elevated numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in the
cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum regions, indicating increased cell death (Figure 6D).

4. Discussion
This study demonstrates a critical role of direct infection of CNS cells and of the inflammatory
response in mediating SARS-CoV-2-induced lethal disease in K18-hACE2 mice. Intranasal
inoculation of the virus results in a lethal disease with high levels of virus replication in the brain.
Virus infection of the CNS was accompanied by an inflammatory response as indicated by the
production of cytokines/chemokines, infiltration of leukocytes into the perivascular space and
parenchyma and CNS cell death. Our data also indicate that following infection by the intranasal
route, the virus enters the brain by traversing the cribriform plate and infecting neuronal processes
located near the site of intranasal inoculation.
Some animal coronaviruses, such as MHV readily infect the neurons and cause lethal
encephalitis in mice [11,39]. SARS-CoV infection also induces severe neurological disease after
intranasal administration in K18-hACE2 mice [27].

Similarly, in our study, SARS-CoV-2 virus

antigen was detected throughout the brain, including the cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. The
onset of severe disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice correlated with peak viral levels in the brain
and immune cell infiltration and CNS cell death. Peak virus titers in the brains were approximately
1,000 times higher than the peak titers in the lungs, suggesting a high replicative potential of SARSCoV-2 in the brain. The relative up-regulation of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs was approximately
10 to 50 times higher in the brain compared to the lungs, strongly suggesting that extensive
neuroinflammation contributed to clinical disease in mice.

It was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice causes severe
pulmonary disease with high virus levels detected in the lungs of these mice and that mortality was
due to the lung infection [22-25]. In these studies, viral RNA was undetectable in the brains of the
majority of the infected animals, indicating a limited role of brain infection in disease induction. An
important distinction between our study and others is that we detected high infectious virus titers in
the olfactory system and brains of 100% of the infected K18-hACE2 mice. This phenotype was not
consistently observed in the aforementioned K18-hACE2 mouse studies [22-25]. Moreover, none of
the published studies evaluated the extent of neuroinflammation and neuropathology at the later
stages of infection. Our results showed that the inflammatory response was more pronounced in the
brain than in the lungs on days 5 and 6 after infection. Although both our study and the previous
studies infected mice via the intranasal route, the other studies used older (7- to 9-week-old) K18hACE2 and a lower viral dose (104 PFU). In our study, six-week-old K18- hACE2 mice were infected
with 105 PFU. It appears that initial virus dose and age of animals are critical determinants of tissue
tropism in this model. More studies are needed to clarify the parameters that differentially affect
tissue tropism, routes of virus dissemination, and mechanisms of lung and brain injuries in K18hACE2 mice following SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Alterations in smell and taste are features of COVID-19 disease in humans [8,40]. Pathological
analyses of human COVID-19 autopsy tissues detected the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in
endothelial cells within the olfactory bulb [40,41]. Our data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can
productively infect cells within the nasal turbinate, eye and olfactory bulb in intranasally infected
K18- hACE2 mice. Virus infection of cells in these tissues in humans may explain the loss of smell
associated with some COVID-19 cases [40]. The detection of virus replication in these tissues suggests
that SARS-CoV-2 can access the brain by first infecting the olfactory bulb and then spreading into the
brain by infecting connecting brain neuron axons. This hypothesis is consistent with previously
published reports that neurotropic coronaviruses infect olfactory neurons and are transmitted to the
brain via axonal transportation [8,26,27,42]. Many viruses, such as HSV-1, Nipah virus, rabies virus,
Hendra virus and influenza A virus, have also been shown to enter the CNS via olfactory sensory
neurons [43-46]. Another route by which a virus can gain access to the brain is via the disruption of
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, we could not detect any virus in the serum of the infected
mice at any time after infection tested, suggesting a limited role of BBB disruption in SARS-CoV-2
neuroinvasion. This finding is in agreement with previously published studies that detected little or
no virus in the blood of K18-hACE2 mice after infection with SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 [2225,27,36].
In summary, we found that intranasal Infection of K18-hACE2 mice by SARS-CoV-2 causes
severe neurological disease. Our data demonstrate that the CNS is the major target of SARS-CoV-2
infection in K18-hACE2 mice under the conditions used, and that brain infection leads to immune
cell infiltration, inflammation and cell death.
