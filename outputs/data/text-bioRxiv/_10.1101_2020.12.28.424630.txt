The RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting
in SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a possible drug target. To understand
how this 3-stemmed pseudoknot responds to the mechanical tension applied by
ribosomes during translation, which is thought to play a key role during frameshifting, we probed its structural dynamics under tension using optical tweezers.
Unfolding curves revealed that the frameshift signal formed multiple different
structures: at least two distinct pseudoknotted conformers with different unfolding forces and energy barriers, as well as alternative stem-loop structures. Refolding curves showed that stem 1 formed first in the pseudoknotted conformers,
followed by stem 3 and then stem 2. By extending the handle holding the RNA to
occlude the 5′ end of stem 1, the proportion of the different pseudoknot conformers could be altered systematically, consistent with structures observed in
cryo-EM images and computational simulations that had distinct topologies: the
5′ end of the RNA threaded through the 3-helix junction to form a ring-knot, or
unthreaded as in more standard H-type pseudoknots. These results resolve the
folding mechanism of the frameshift signal in SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the
dynamic conformational heterogeneity of this RNA, with important implications
for structure-based drug-discovery efforts.
Like most coronaviruses, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) causing the COVID-19 pandemic makes use of −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting
(−1 PRF) to express proteins that are essential for viral replication1. In −1 PRF, a shift in the
reading frame of the ribosome at a specific location in the RNA message is stimulated by a structure in the mRNA located 5–7 nt downstream of the ‘slippery’ sequence where the reading-frame
shift occurs, thereby generating alternate gene products2,3. Previous work on viruses including
HIV-1 and SARS-CoV showed that mutations modulating the level of −1 PRF can significantly
attenuate viral propagation in cell culture4–6. As a result, the structures stimulating −1 PRF are
potential targets for anti-viral drugs7–9, motivating efforts to find ligands active against −1 PRF
in SARS-CoV-2 that could be used to treat COVID-19 10–14.
The pseudoknot stimulating −1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 has a 3-stem architecture1,10,15,16 (Fig.
1A) that is characteristic of coronaviruses, in contrast to the more common 2-stem architecture of
most viral frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots17. Cryo-EM imaging10,15 and computational modeling18 both suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot can take on several different conformers
(Fig. 1B, C). Some of these conformers involve knot-like fold topologies that have not previously been observed in frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknots, specifically conformers with the 5′ end
threaded through the junction between the 3 helices to generate what we term a ‘ring-knot’10,15,18.
Such a 5′-end threaded ring-knot fold has only previously been observed in viral exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs19–21. Intriguingly, the co-existence of multiple conformers in the SARS-CoV-

2 pseudoknot is consistent with evidence from studies of
various stimulatory structures, both pseudoknots and hairpins22–25, as well as from studies of the effects of antiframeshifting ligands26, which shows that the stimulation
of −1 PRF is linked primarily to conformational heterogeneity in the stimulatory structure. In particular, −1 PRF is
linked to the conformational heterogeneity under tension27
in the range of forces applied by the ribosome during
translation28,29. However, the dynamic ensemble of conformers populated by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot has
not yet been explored experimentally, and the folding
mechanism of this pseudoknot—especially its unusual
ring-knotted conformer—remains unknown.
Here we examine the conformational dynamics of the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot in the single-molecule regime.

folding dynamics . We find that the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signal indeed forms at least 2 distinct pseudoknotted conformers, one involving threading of the 5′-end to form a ring-knot and
the other without any threading. Stem 1 usually folds first, followed by stem 3 and lastly stem 2,
but sometimes alternate stem-loops form that displace the pseudoknotted structures. The existence of multiple conformers of this frameshift signal has important implications for structurebased efforts to find small-molecule therapeutics targeting −1 PRF.
Results:
To probe the conformations formed by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, their folding pathways,
and the dynamics under tension, we annealed a single RNA molecule containing the sequence of
the pseudoknot flanked by ‘handle’ regions to DNA handles that were attached to beads held in
optical traps (Fig 2A). We then moved the traps apart to ramp up the force and unfold the RNA,
and brought them back together to ramp down the force and refold the RNA. Force-extension
curves (FECs) measured during unfolding in near-physiological ionic conditions (130 mM K+, 4
mM Mg2+) showed one or more characteristic transitions in which the extension abruptly increased and force simultaneously decreased when part or all of the structure unfolded cooperatively (Fig. 2B). Unfolding events were observed over a range of forces from ~5–50 pN; similar
transitions were seen in refolding FECs, but at forces below ~15 pN (Fig. 2C).
Examining the unfolding FECs in more detail, we found two qualitatively different behaviors
distinguished by different length changes. Measuring the amount of RNA unfolded by fitting the
FECs before and after the transition to worm-like chain polymer elasticity models (Eq. 1, Methods) for the handles and unfolded RNA (Fig. 2B, dashed lines), we found that ~80% of FECs
(Fig. 2B, black) showed a contour length change of ΔLc = 35.1 ± 0.3 nm for complete unfolding
(Table S1). This result was close to the value expected for full unfolding of the pseudoknot,

34.7–36.5 nm, based on cryo-EM
reconstructions10,15 and computational modeling of likely structures18. Sometimes these curves
contained an intermediate state, I1
(Fig. 2B, magenta), which unfolded
with a length corresponding to stem
1 (ΔLc = 17.5 ± 0.4 nm), but most
of the time they showed a single
cooperative unfolding transition.
The remaining ~20% of the FECs
(Fig. 2B, green) unfolded with a
smaller total length change of ΔLc
= 25 ± 1 nm, indicating an alternate
structure that was incompletely
folded, at forces of ~10–20 pN;
such alternative structures have
been observed previously for many
frameshift signals22,33. This second
class of FECs also often contained
at least one unfolding intermediate.
There is a characteristic shape
expected for the distribution of unfolding forces, p(Fu), for unfolding
across a single barrier34, hence

Such behavior has been seen previously in ligand-bound riboswitches37 and proteins35. By fitting
p(Fu) to a kinetic model for barrier crossing (Eq. 2, Methods), the shape of the energy barrier can
be characterized through its height (ΔG‡) and distance from the folded state (Δx‡), reporting on
the nature of the interactions that hold the structure together32. We found that p(Fu) did not fit
well to the distribution expected for a single initial state (Fig. 2D, blue), but it did fit well to the
distribution expected for two initial states (Fig. 2D, red; fit parameters listed in Table S2). The
results for ΔG‡ were similar within error for the two initial states, respectively 40 ± 10 kJ/mol for

was notably smaller for N: 0.7 ±

the value for Δx‡ was consistent

pseudoknots22,38 and other structures containing tertiary contacts39–

Given that the SARS-CoV-2
pseudoknot is predicted to form
different fold topologies, such as
the 5′-threaded and unthreaded conformers seen in simulations18, such

would reduce the likelihood of 5′end threading. We first re-measured the FECs after moving the duplex 6 nt away from stem 1,
instead of 1 nt away as in the measurements in Fig. 2, to make threading easier (Fig. 3A). We
found the same contour length changes as before (Table S1), but now the lower-force peak in
p(Fu) was reduced to a small shoulder (Fig. 3B), with the fraction of FECs showing full-length
ΔLc attributed to N′ reduced from 20 ± 3% of the FECs to 9 ± 2%, and the fraction attributed to
N increased correspondingly from 80 ± 3% to 91 ± 2%. In contrast, when the handle was instead
extended past the 5′ end of the pseudoknot so that it paired with the first 2 nts in stem 1 (Fig. 3C,
inset), the FECs (Fig. S1) revealed an unfolding force distribution with a significant increase in
the occurrence of N′, to 45 ± 4% of the curves with full-length ΔLc, and a corresponding decrease
in N to 55 ± 4% (Fig. 3C). Extending the handle duplex closer to the 5′ end thus produced a clear
trend, suppressing N but enhancing N′ (Fig. 3D). However, the occupancy of the alternative,
non-pseudoknotted structures was unchanged as the handle was lengthened (Table S1), and the
landscape parameters for the two populations also remained the same within error (Table S2).

Unfolding force distribution shows two peaks, both at lower force than with Mg2+. Red: two-population fit

The fact that the only significant effect of changing the handles was to rebalance the ratio of N′
to N supports the conclusion that N is a 5′-threaded conformer, whereas N′ is an unthreaded conformer.
Turning to the refolding FECs, we found that the pseudoknotted conformers always refolded
through one or more intermediate states. The first refolding transition, which was in the force
range ~10–15 pN, had ΔLc = 17.7 ± 0.6 nm (Fig. 2C), consistent with the value of 16.7 nm expected for folding of stem 1 in both the threaded and unthreaded models18 (Table S1, Fig. S2).
After forming stem 1, often the pseudoknot refolded all at once (Fig. 2C, red), but other times it
refolded through an additional intermediate (Fig. 2C, blue). The cumulative length changes from
the unfolded state for these subsequent transitions were ΔLc = 29.2 ± 0.6 nm and 35.3 ± 0.6 nm,
consistent with expectations respectively for folding stem 3 as well as stem 1 (29.8 nm), and then
stem 2 to form the complete pseudoknot (34.7–36.3 nm for 5′-threaded and unthreaded conformers). Stem 2 thus folded last, after stem 3. Intriguingly, this order is precisely what is needed to
form a 5′-threaded fold topology: stem 2 must form last, after the 5′ end is passed over the junction between stems 1 and 3. To confirm the identification of these structures in the intermediates,

we repeated the measurements using anti-sense oligos to block the formation either of stem 1
(oligo 1) or stem 2 and part of stem 3 (oligo 2), as shown in Fig. 4A. The initial refolding transitions with oligo 2 present (Fig. 4B) showed effectively the same p(Fu) (Fig. 4C, red) as without
the oligo (Fig. 4C, black), and close to the same ΔLc, too, albeit elongated by an extra ~2 basepairs formed with the part of stem 3 liberated by oligo 2 (Table S1, Fig. S2), confirming that
stem 1 was first to refold. FECs with oligo 1 (Fig. 4D), on the other hand, showed refolding at
notably lower force than stem 1 (Fig. 4C, blue); unfolding proceeded via an intermediate with a
length corresponding to the lower half of stem 3, ΔLc = 8 ± 1 nm (Table S1, Fig. S2).
Finally, we tested the importance of Mg2+ for the folding and stability of the pseudoknot by
re-measuring FECs in the absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4E). We found that 97% of curves showed the
length change for pseudoknot unfolding, although ΔLc was ~ 1 nm shorter than previously (Table
S1). Two populations were still present in p(Fu) (Fig. 4F), but the high-force population was
greatly reduced (down to only 40 ± 8% of the FECs showing full-length unfolding), and it
peaked at lower forces. Mg2+ was therefore not required for folding of the pseudoknot, but it
played a key role in promoting the formation of the higher-force population attributed to the
ring-knot fold topology. Fitting p(Fu) to characterize changes in the landscape (Fig. 4F, red), we
found that ΔG‡ was little changed, but Δx‡ was significantly higher, rising to 4.0 ± 0.6 nm for N′
and 2.8 ± 0.7 nm for N (Table S2), indicating that the pseudoknots were much less rigid without
Mg2+.
Discussion:
These results confirm the suggestion from simulations and cryo-EM imaging that the SARSCoV-2 frameshift signal can form a variety of different structures, and they reveal how these
structures respond to mechanical tension similar to what the ribosome would apply during −1
PRF. The most prominent conformation, N, unfolded through the full length of the pseudoknot at
moderately high force and was suppressed by occlusion of the 5′ end by the duplex handle, precisely as would be expected for a 5′-end threaded structure such as those seen in cryo-EM images
on and off the ribosome10,15 or predicted from simulations18. In contrast, the conformation unfolding at lower force (N′) occurred more frequently when the 5′ end was occluded, in proportion
to the suppression of N, as would be expected for a conformation in which the 5′
end remains unthreaded. Although predicted computationally18, unthreaded conformations have not yet been identified in
cryo-EM images; they are nevertheless expected to be present at some level because
they will form naturally in a kinetic partitioning process whenever stem 2 folds
while the 5′ end is not lying across the stem
1/stem 3 junction (as required for 5′-end
threading), similar to what was seen in the
folding of the Zika exonuclease-resistant

lowed either by sequential folding of stem 3 then stem 2, or else cooperative refolding of both
stems simultaneously. The orientation of the 5′ end at the moment of stem 2 formation partitions
the molecule into two distinct fold topologies that cannot interconvert: 5′-threaded or unthreaded.
These two fold topologies then give rise to distinct unfolding behaviors: higher forces for the
threaded fold, lower forces for the unthreaded fold. Notably absent from this picture, however, is
a third fold that was predicted computationally with the 3′ threaded through the stem 2/stem 3
junction18, given that this fold requires stem 1 to form last instead of first.
The energy landscape parameters for unfolding states N and N′ further support this picture, in
particular Δx‡, which reports on the mechanical rigidity of the RNA structure. Smaller Δx‡ implies a rigid structure that is less sensitive to tension and hence more likely rupture in a brittle
manner at high force, whereas larger Δx‡ implies a compliant structure that is more sensitive to
tension and ruptures in a lower, narrower range of forces. State N was much more mechanically
rigid than N′, with Δx‡ roughly 3 times smaller, which makes sense in terms of the mechanical
effects of threading: threading of the 5′ end should rigidify the fold via interactions between the
5′ end and the helical junction in the pseudoknot18 that constrain the motion of the terminus in
response to tension applied to the 5′ end, compared to the unthreaded fold. Indeed, the Δx‡ value
of only 0.7 nm for state N is among the smallest reported for any pseudoknot, signifying the particular rigidity of this unusual fold topology; in contrast, the Δx‡ value for N′ is comparable to
the range of values more typically reported for other pseudoknots, ~1.5–2 nm22,38. The fact that
Δx‡ increased significantly for both N and N′ in the absence of Mg2+ shows that although Mg2+ is
not required for the pseudoknot folding, consistent with results from NMR16, it is essential for
stabilizing tertiary contacts that rigidify both the threaded and unthreaded folds. Comparing the
NMR results to computational modeling18 suggests that Mg2+-mediated tertiary interactions may
be especially important in stem 2, explaining why both N and N′ are more compliant in the absence of Mg2+.
Comparing the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot to the Zika virus exonuclease-resistant RNA (xrRNA), the only other RNA forming a similar ring-knot whose folding has been studied, reveals
some interesting differences. The ring-knot in the Zika virus xrRNA unfolds at a much higher
force, above 60 pN, acting as a mechanical road-block to digestion of the viral RNA by host exoribonucleases21. Such extreme mechanical resistance would be functionally counterproductive
for the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, however, which acts to induce a frameshift but does not prevent ribosomal translocation. Concurrently, these two RNAs differ in the importance of Mg2+ for
threading of the 5′ end before closure of the pseudoknot: threading is abolished entirely for the
Zika virus xrRNA in the absence of Mg2+, but is only partially inhibited (not abolished) for the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, indicating that at least some of the interactions that stablize threading
must be independent of Mg2+. We speculate that the reduced role of Mg2+ in 5′-threading in the
SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot may reduce the mechanical stability of the ring-knot sufficiently to
allow the ribosome to unfold it during −1 PRF.
Finally, we note that the significant heterogeneity seen for the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signal is entirely consistent with the direct correlation between conformational heterogeneity and −1
PRF efficiency found in recent work27, given the relatively high level of −1 PRF in SARS-CoV2 observed in functional assays1,11. The existence of distinct fold topologies also has important
implications for structure-based drug-discovery efforts targeting the SARS-CoV-2 frameshift
signal, because the structure of the junction between the helices in the pseudoknot, which is the
locus of the most likely binding pockets for small molecules14,43, is strongly affected by whether

the 5′ end is threaded or not18. Combining these two observations suggests a strategy for developing small-molecule modulators of −1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2: since −1 PRF efficiency varies
directly with the conformational Shannon entropy27, ligands that stabilize the 5′-threaded conformer (thereby decreasing the heterogeneity) should be sought for inhibiting −1 PRF, whereas
ligands that stabilize the unthreaded conformer (thereby increasing the heterogeneity) should be
sought for enhancing −1 PRF.
Methods:
Sample preparation: Samples consisting of a single RNA strand linked at each end to doublestranded handles were prepared in two ways. (1) An RNA strand containing the SARS-CoV-2
pseudoknot and spacer sequences (Fig 1A) flanked by long ‘handle’ sequences was annealed to
single-stranded (ss) DNA complementary to the handles sequences, as described previously22.
The DNA fragment corresponding to the sequence in Fig. 1A was cloned into the pMLuc-1
plasmid between the BamHI and SpeI sites. A 2,749-bp DNA transcription template was amplified by PCR from this plasmid, containing a T7 promoter in the upstream primer, followed by a
1,882-bp handle sequence, the pseudoknot in the middle, and then a 798-bp handle sequence
downstream; RNA was transcribed from this template in vitro. Two ssDNA handles complementary to the upstream and downstream handle sequences in the RNA were created by asymmetric
PCR. The 3′ end of the 1,882-nt DNA handle was labeled with dig-ddUTP using terminal transferase (Roche), and the 798-nt DNA handle of the transcript was functionalized with biotin on
the 5′ end of the PCR primer. The RNA transcript was annealed to the DNA handles. (2) A
shorter RNA strand was annealed to a 300-nt ssDNA handle on one end, and to the overhang on
a 2,094-bp double-stranded (ds) DNA handle on the other end. The dsDNA handle, labeled with
digoxigenin via the upstream primer, was prepared by digesting a 2,075-bp PCR product amplified from the plasmid pUC19 with PspGI, and then ligating a 56-nt DNA oligo to the digest
sticky end to create a 36-nt 3′ overhang. RNA was transcribed in vitro from a 406-bp DNA template containing a T7 promoter, the 36-nt sequence complementary to the ssDNA overhang, the
pseudoknot and spacer sequences (Fig. 1A), and a 300-nt handle sequence; this transcription
template was made by cloning the required DNA sequences into a modified pMLuc-1 vector between the XhoI and SpeI sites. A 300-nt ssDNA handle complementary to the handle region of
the RNA transcript was made by asymmetric PCR and annealed to the RNA, as above. The resulting DNA-RNA complex was then annealed to the overhang of the dsDNA handle.
Constructs were readied for measurement as described previously22. Briefly, the RNA/handle
constructs were diluted to ~160 pM and mixed with equal volumes of 600-nm and 820-nm diameter polystyrene beads (coated respectively with avidin DN and anti-digoxigenin) at concentrations of ~250 pM, and incubated for ~1 hour at room temperature to create ‘dumbbells’. The incubation was then diluted ~100-fold into RNAse-free measuring buffer: 50 mM MOPS pH 7.5,
130 mM KCl, 4mM MgCl2, and 200 U/mL RNAse inhibitor (SUPERase•In, Ambion). An oxygen scavenging system consisting of 40 U/mL glucose oxidase, 185 U/mL catalase, and 250 mM
D-glucose was also included in the buffer. The diluted dumbbells were placed in a flow chamber
prepared on a microscope slide and inserted into the optical trap.
FEC measurements and data analysis: Measurements were made using custom-built optical
traps described previously37. Traps were calibrated for position detection for each dumbbell prior
to measurement, as described previously44. FECs were measured by moving the traps apart at a
constant speed of ~160 nm/s to increase the force up to ~50 pN and unfold the RNA, bringing

allow refolding, and then repeating the cycle. Trap stiffnesses were 0.45–0.62 pN/nm. Data were

oligos added 10 μM oligo 1 or oligo 2 to the measuring buffer. For measurements in the absence
of Mg2+, we removed the MgCl2 from the measuring buffer and added 1 mM EDTA.
Each of the branches of the FECs separated by ‘rips’ representing unfolding/refolding transitions was fit to an extensible worm-like chain (WLC) model relating the applied force, F, and
molecular extension, x:

where Lp is the persistence length, Lc the contour length, and K the enthalpic elasticity45. Two
WLCs in series were used for the fitting, one to describe the duplex handles and the other for the
unfolded RNA37. The WLC parameters for the handles, found from fitting the folded state of the
FECs, were typically Lp ~ 40 nm, Lc ~ 850 nm for the shorter construct and ~950 nm for the
longer one, and K ~ 1000 pN. The parameters for the unfolded RNA were fixed at Lp = 1 nm, Lc
= 0.59 nm/nt, and K = 1500 pN, so that the only free parameter was the number of nucleotides
unfolded.
Force distributions were fit to the theory of Dudko et al34:

zero force, Δx‡ is the distance from the folded state to the barrier, ΔG‡ is the barrier height, and
1/β = kBT is the thermal energy. Distributions of the unfolding forces showing two peaks were fit
by a sum of two independent distributions represented by Eq. 2. Errors for the fitting parameters
were found from bootstrapping analysis. We verified that two-population fits of p(Fu) were justified using the Akaike information criterion to test for overfitting and the Wald-Wolfowitz runs
test to assess underfitting. These tests rejected the single-population fits in favor of the doublepopulation fits in each case.

Lengths vary depending on the structural model, because of differences between the locations of the termini.
2
The expected ΔLc without Mg2+ is based on simulations from Ref. 18, which may overestimate ΔLc if interactions at
the 5′ end are Mg2+-dependent.
3
The expected ΔLc for the alternative stem loops should be shorter as the handle is extended toward stem 1.
4
The effect of extending the handle into stem 1 is estimated from models in Refs. 15 and 18, but the estimates do not
include possible distortions from the disruption of stem 1 and its stacking with stem 3.

stem 1 only (left) and both stems 1 and 3 (right). For Ir2, the geometry of the 5′ end just before closure of
stem 2 determines the fold topology: threaded (red) or unthreaded (pink). (C) Model of alternative stemloop structure, which prevents pseudoknot formation. (D) Structures formed with oligo 1 bound to stem 1.
Intermediate I4 is proposed to be stabilized by the C37:G51:A52 triple (green triangle) found in Ref. 18.
(E) Structures formed with oligo 2 bound to stem 2. Stem 1 is extended to pair with some of the unpaired
