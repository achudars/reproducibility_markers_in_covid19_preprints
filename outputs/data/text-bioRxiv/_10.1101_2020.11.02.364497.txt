Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus whose success as a pathogen relies on its ability to repurpose
host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) to form its own RNA interactome. Here, we developed and
applied a robust ribonucleoprotein capture protocol to uncover the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
interactome. We report 109 host factors that directly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs including
general antiviral factors such as ZC3HAV1, TRIM25, and PARP12. Applying RNP capture on
another coronavirus HCoV-OC43 revealed evolutionarily conserved interactions between viral
RNAs and host proteins. Network and transcriptome analyses delineated antiviral RBPs
stimulated by JAK-STAT signaling and proviral RBPs responsible for hijacking multiple steps of
the mRNA life cycle. By knockdown experiments, we further found that these viral-RNAinteracting RBPs act against or in favor of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, this study provides a
comprehensive list of RBPs regulating coronaviral replication and opens new avenues for
therapeutic interventions.

Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped viruses with nonsegmented, single-stranded,
positive-sense (+) RNA genomes, which belong to order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and
subfamily Coronavirinae (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). They are classified into four genera:
Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus which exclusively infect mammals and
Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus which primarily infect birds (Woo et al., 2012). Human
CoVs such as Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E and Betacoronavirus HCoV-OC43 have been
known since the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966) as etiologic agents of the common cold.
However, with the beginning of the 21st century, the world experienced the emergence of five
novel human coronavirus species including highly pathogenic Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 (Peiris et al., 2003), Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (de Groot et al., 2013), and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019
(Zhou et al., 2020).

At the core of the coronavirus particle, the RNA genome is encapsulated in nucleocapsid (N)
protein and surrounded by the viral membrane that contains spike (S) protein, membrane (M)
protein, and envelope (E) protein (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). The coronaviral RNA genome is
~30 kb which is the longest among RNA viruses and contains a 5′-cap structure and a 3′ poly(A)
tail (Bouvet et al., 2010; Lai and Stohlman, 1981). Upon cell entry, the genomic RNA (gRNA)
acts as an mRNA to produce nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are required for viral RNA
production (Perlman and Netland, 2009). The ORF1a encodes polypeptide 1a (pp1a, 440-500
kDa) that is cleaved into 11 nsps. The −1 ribosomal frameshift occurs immediately upstream of
the ORF1a stop codon, allowing translation of downstream ORF1b, yielding a large polypeptide
(pp1ab, 740-810 kDa) that is cleaved into 15 nsps. Together, 16 different nsp fragments are
generated to construct double-membrane vesicles (DMV) and mediate subsequent steps of viral
RNA synthesis.

After this initial stage of viral translation, the gRNA is used as the template for the synthesis of
negative-strand (-) RNA intermediates which in turn serve as the templates for positive-sense (+)
RNA synthesis (Snijder et al., 2016; Sola et al., 2015). Ten different canonical (+) RNA species
are produced from the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which include one full-length gRNA and nine

subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Kim et al., 2020a). All canonical viral (+) RNAs share the
common 5 end sequence called the leader sequence and the 3 end sequences. The sgRNAs
′

′

are generated via discontinuous transcription which leads to the fusion between the 5 leader
′

sequence and the “body” parts containing the downstream open reading frames (Sola et al.,
2015) that encode structural proteins (S, E, M, and N) and accessory proteins (3a, 3c, 6, 7a, 7b,
8, and 9b) (Kim et al., 2020a).

To accomplish this, coronaviruses employ unique strategies to evade, modulate, and utilize the
host machinery (Fung and Liu, 2019). For example, the gRNA molecules must be kept in an
intricate balance between translation, transcription, and encapsulation by recruiting the right
host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and forming specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. As
host cells counteract by launching RBPs such as RIG-I, MDA5, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to
recognize and eliminate viral RNAs, the virus needs to evade the immune system using its
components to win the arms race between virus and host. How such stealthy devices are
genetically coded in this compact RNA genome is yet to be explored (Snijder et al., 2016). Thus,
the identification of the RBPs that bind to viral transcripts (or the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome)
is key to uncovering the molecular rewiring of viral gene regulation and the activation of antiviral
defense systems.

Biochemical techniques for studying RNA-protein interactions have been developed
(Ramanathan et al., 2019) with the advancement in protein-centric methods such as CLIP-seq
(crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) (Ule et al., 2018). In CLIP-seq
experiments, RNP complexes are crosslinked by UV irradiation within cells to identify direct
RNA-protein interactions. The protein of interest is immunoprecipitated to identify the associated
RNAs (Lee and Ule, 2018; Van Nostrand et al., 2020). More recently, RNA-centric methods
have also been developed to profile the mRNA interactome and RNP complexes (Roth and
Diederichs, 2015). After UV irradiation, the RNA of interest is purified with oligonucleotide
probes and the crosslinked proteins are identified by mass spectrometry. For example, RAP-MS
exhibits compelling evidence of highly confident profiling of proteins that bind to a specific RNA
owing to a combination of long hybridization probes and harsh denaturing condition (Engreitz et
al., 2013; McHugh et al., 2015).

In this study, we developed a robust RNP capture protocol to define the repertoire of viral and
host proteins that associate with the transcripts of coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV-2 and

Results and Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 RNP purification

To identify the viral and host proteins that directly interact with the genomic and subgenomic
RNAs of SARS-CoV-2, we modified the RNA antisense purification coupled with mass
spectrometry (RAP-MS) (McHugh and Guttman, 2018) protocol which was developed to profile
the interacting proteins of a particular RNA species (Figure 1A). Briefly, cells were first detached
from culture vessels and then irradiated with 254 nm UV to induce RNA-protein crosslink while
preserving RNA integrity. Crosslinked cells were treated with DNase and lysed with an
optimized buffer condition to homogenize and denature the proteins in high concentration.
Massive pools of biotinylated antisense 90-nt probes were used to capture the denatured RNP
complexes in a sequence-specific manner. After stringent washing and detergent removal, the
RNP complexes were released and digested by serial benzonase and on-bead trypsin treatment.
These modifications to the RAP-MS protocol enabled robust and sensitive identification of
proteins directly bound to the RNA target of interest (see Methods for detailed explanation).

We designed two separate pools of densely overlapping 90-nt antisense probes to achieve an
unbiased perspective of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome (Figure 1B and Table S1). The
SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome consists of (1) a genomic RNA (gRNA) encoding 16 nonstructural
proteins (nsps) and (2) multiple subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) that encode structural and
accessory proteins (Sola et al., 2015). The sgRNAs are more abundant than the gRNA (Kim et
al., 2020a). The first pool (“Probe I”) consists of 707 oligos tiles every 30 nucleotides across the
ORF1ab region (266:21553, NC_045512.2) and thus hybridizes specifically with the gRNA
molecules (Figure 1B). The second pool of 275 oligos (“Probe II”) covers the remaining region
(21563:29872, NC_045512.2) which is shared by both the gRNA and sgRNAs.

To first check whether our method specifically captures the viral RNP complexes, we compared
the resulting purification from Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2
(BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020) at MOI 0.1 for 24 hours (Kim et al., 2020b) by either Probe I or
Probe II. As negative controls, we pulled-down without probes (“no probe” control) or with the
control probes (for either 18S or 28S rRNA). Protein composition of each RNP sample was
distinct as shown by silver staining and western blotting (Figure S1A) with prominent SARS-

CoV-2 N protein associated with Probes I and II, as expected. Enrichment of SARS-CoV-2
RNAs were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Figure S1B), suggesting that our protocol purfies specific
RNP complexes. Note that SARS-CoV-2 gRNA was not enriched in the Probe II experiment,
hinting at the excess amount of sgRNAs over gRNA in our culture condition.

Comprehensive identification of proteins binding to the SARS-CoV-2 transcripts

We conducted Label-free quantification (LFQ) by liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and identified 429 host proteins and 9 viral proteins in total (Figure
1C). As highly abundant proteins may nonspecifically co-precipitate during the RNP capture
experiment, we statistically modelled this protein background as a multinomial distribution and
assessed the probability (i.e. p-value) of the quantity of the identified protein in the RNP capture
(e.g. Probe I) experiment over the protein background of the control (e.g. no-probe) experiment
(see Methods for details). This unweighted spectral count analysis resulted in 199 and 220
proteins that are overrepresented in the Probe I and Probe II sample, respectively (FDR < 10%,
Table S2). Protein domain enrichment analysis revealed that these proteins indeed harbor RNAbinding domains such as RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain and K Homology (KH) domain
(Figure S1C). Of note, unlike the cellular mRNA interactome (Castello et al., 2012; Gerstberger
et al., 2014), the RNA-binding repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs showed a depletion of
DEAD/DEAH box helicase domains and an enrichment of KH domain.

As for viral proteins, the N protein was the most strongly enriched one, as expected (Figure 1D).
The nsp1 protein was also statistically enriched in both Probe I and Probe II experiments.
Nsp12, S, M, and nsp9 were detected more with Probe I than with Probe II. Coronavirus nsp9 is
a single-strand RNA binding protein (Egloff et al., 2004; Sutton et al., 2004) essential for viral
replication (Miknis et al., 2009). Nsp1 is one of the major virulence factors that suppresses host
translation by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit (Thoms et al., 2020). While nsp1 is mostly
studied in the context of host gene expression (Narayanan et al., 2008), our result hints at the
direct role of nsp1 on the transcripts of SARS-CoV-2.

To delineate the host proteins that are enriched in the SARS-CoV-2 RNP complex, we
employed an additional negative control experiment with uninfected cells (Figure 1E). In effect,
this control provides a conservative background of host proteins as shown by silver staining

(Figure S1D). Distributions of peptide length were consistent across technical replicates (Figure
S1E), demonstrating the robustness of the“on-bead” digestion step. Spectral count analysis
against the “uninfected probe control” resulted in 74 and 72 proteins that are enriched in the
infected samples with Probe I and Probe II, respectively (FDR < 5%, Figure 1F-H). In
combination, we define these 109 proteins as the “SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome.” 37 host
proteins such as CSDE1 (Unr), EIF4H, FUBP3, G3BP2, PABPC1, ZC3HAV1 were enriched in
both the Probe I and Probe II RNP capture experiments on infected cells (Figure 1F), thus
identifying a robust set of the “core SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome.” Gene ontology (GO) term
enrichment analysis revealed that these host factors are involved in RNA stability control,
mRNA function, and viral process (Figure S1F).

Conservation of betacoronavirus RNP complexes

To investigate the evolutionary conservation of the RNA-protein interactions in coronaviruses,
we conducted RNP capture on HCoV-OC43 that belongs to the lineage A of genus
betacoronavirus. HCoV-OC43 shows 54.2% nucleotide homology to SARS-CoV-2 which
belongs to lineage B. We profiled the HCoV-OC43 RNP complexes at multiple time points: 12,
24, 36, and 48 hours post-infection (Figure 2A, S2A and S2B). Two antisense probe sets (i.e.
OC43 Probe I and OC43 Probe II) were designed in a similar manner as in SARS-CoV-2
experiments. OC43 Probe I hybridizes only with the gRNA of HCoV-OC43, while Probe II
captures both gRNA and sgRNA molecules. As negative controls, the no-probe control on
infected cells and the probe control on uninfected cells were used and confirmed by silver
staining (Figure S2C).

Unweighted spectral count analysis against the no-probe control revealed 133, 167, 192, and
160 proteins that are overrepresented in the OC43 Probe I experiment at 12, 24, 36, and 48
hours post-infection (hpi), respectively (FDR < 10%, Table S3). For the OC43 Probe II
experiment, 119, 189, 194, and 185 proteins were overrepresented at each respective infection
time point of 12, 24, 36, and 48 hpi (FDR < 10%, Table S4). The analysis of all eight RNP
capture experiments resulted in the enrichment of proteins containing canonical RNA binding
domains such as the RRM domain and the KH domain (Figure S2D), indicating the specificity of
the coprecipitated RBPs.

Fourteen viral proteins were detected within the HCoV-OC43 RNP complexes (Figure 2B,
Figure S2E). Specifically, LFQ intensities for viral structural proteins N, M, and S increased over
time more evidently in the gRNA-hybridizing Probe I experiment (Figure 2B). HCoV-OC43 2a,
an accessory protein unique to betacoronavirus lineage A, was also detected and increased
over time, indicating that this protein of unknown function may act as an RBP. The RdRP nsp12
and the papain-like protease nsp3 also increased along with the other nsps identified in this
experiment. Only a marginal amount of the HCoV-OC43 nsp1 was detected (Figure S2E),
implying the functional divergence of nsp1 in betacoronavirus lineages A and B.

Next, we compared the host factors that form the viral RNA interactome of HCoV-OC43 and
SARS-CoV-2. All 107 proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were also detected in the
HCoV-OC43 interactome throughout multiple infection timepoints, except for RBMS1 and
DDX3Y (Figure 2C), indicating that many of the same host proteins interact with RNAs of both
HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2. To determine the core host factors that are conserved in the
coronavirus RNA interactomes, we applied our spectral count analysis on the HCoV-OC43
experiment of 36 hpi (Figure S2A) and conducted statistical analysis in comparison to the noprobe control (Figure 2D, FDR < 10%) and the uninfected-probe control (Figure 2E, FDR < 5%).
We identified 67 and 70 host proteins for the HCoV-OC43 Probe I and Probe II experiments,
respectively (Table S5). 38 proteins were statistically enriched in both probe sets. GO term
enrichment analysis revealed that these 38 host proteins are involved in transcriptional
regulation, RNA processing, and RNA stability control (Figure S2F). Of the 38 common proteins,
14 host proteins (CELF1, EIF4H, ELAVL1, FAM120A, FUBP3, IGF2BP3, MATR3, MOV10,
NONO, PABPC1, PABPC4, PTBP3, RALY, SND1 and ZC3HAV1) were also found in the
SARS-CoV-2 experiments (Figure 2F), and thus are conserved host components of the
betacoronavirus RNA interactome.

Regulatory landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome

To understand the regulatory significance of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, we compiled a
list of “neighboring” proteins that are known to physically interact with the factors identified in our
study (see Methods for details). In particular, we generated a physical interaction network
centered (or seeded) by the core SARS-CoV-2 interactome (Figure S3A). Network analysis
revealed several network hubs (e.g. NPM1 and PABPC1) and two highly connected network

modules: the ribosomal subunits and the EIF3 complex. GO term enrichment analysis resulted
in translation-related biological processes (Figure S3B), most likely due to the
overrepresentation of ribosomal proteins and subunits of the EIF3 complex, which reflects the
active translational status of viral mRNPs.

To achieve a more indepth functional perspective of the RNA interactome, we reconstructed the
physical interaction network with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome but excluding ribosomal
proteins and EIF3 proteins (Figure 3A). This analysis identified additional hub proteins such as
TRIM25, SQSTM1, and KHDRBS1. GO term enrichment analysis revealed multiple steps of the
mRNA life cycle such as mRNA splicing, mRNA export, mRNA stability, and stress granule
assembly (Figure 3B), suggesting these mRNA regulators are co-opted to assist the viral life
cycle. Interestingly, we also found GO terms related to viral processes and innate immune
response. In terms of intracellular localization, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome is enriched by
proteins localized in the paraspeckle and cytoplasmic RNP granule (e.g. stress granule)
compared to the cellular mRNA interactome (Figure 3C) (Baltz et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2012).
These observations suggest the regulatory mechanisms of viral RNAs distinct from that of host
mRNAs, which involve activation of host antiviral machinery and sequestration of viral RNAs.

Another way to gauge the regulatory potential of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome is to
examine them in the context of the transcriptional response to viral infection. For example,
infected cells recognize the non-cellular RNAs by a number of cytosolic sensors such as RIG-I
(DDX58) and MDA5 (IFIH1) and ultimately induces interferons which in turn up-regulates
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the JAK-STAT pathway (Sa Ribero et al., 2020).
Multiple studies have reported the unusually low-level of type I/III interferon responses in cell
and animal model systems of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) and blood
biopsy from COVID-19 patients (Hadjadj et al., 2020), indicating active immune evasion by
SARS-CoV-2 and supporting the therapeutic potential of timely interferon treatment (Sa Ribero
et al., 2020).

To investigate the regulation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome, we utilized published
transcriptome data of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Transcriptome
analysis of ACE2-expressing A549 cells revealed host factors of SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome
that are differentially expressed after infection (Figure 4A). Specifically, PARP12, SHFL, CELF1,
and TRIM25 are up-regulated upon infection. Treatment of ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and 2 inhibitor, in

infected cells suppressed the expression of 5 host factors (MOV10, PARP12, SHFL, TRIM25,
and ZC3HAV1) (Figure 4B). TRIM25 and PARP12 are part of the 62 vertebrate core ISGs
(Shaw et al., 2017). Interferon-beta (INFß) treatment on normal human bronchial epithelial
(NHBE) cells induces PARP12, SHFL, and TRIM25 (Figure 4C). Consistently, proteome
analysis of INFß-treated cells (Kerr et al., 2020) exhibited an upregulation of PARP12, TRIM25,
and ZC3HAV1 (Figure S3C), altogether indicating that JAK-STAT signaling pathway regulates
part of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome. Moreover, reanalysis of mRNA-seq data of postmortem lung samples from COVID-19 patients (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020) showed up-regulation
of SHFL and ZC3HAV1 (Figure 4D), highlighting the physiological relevance of SARS-CoV-2
RNP regulation in natural human infection of SARS-CoV-2.

Host factors and functional modules that regulate the SARS-CoV-2 RNAs

To measure the impact of these host proteins on coronavirus RNAs, we conducted knockdown
experiments and infected Calu-3 cells with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5A and 5B). Calu-3 cells are
human lung epithelial cells and often used as a model system for coronavirus infection (Sims et
al., 2008). Strategically, we selected a subset of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome that covers
a broad range of functional modules that we identified above: JAK-STAT signaling, mRNA
transport, mRNA stability, and translation. Knockdown of host factors that are stimulated by
SARS-CoV-2 infection or INFß treatment, namely PARP12, TRIM25, ZC3HAV1, CELF1, and
SHFL, led to increased viral RNAs (Figure 5C). The result suggests that these RBPs which
directly recognize the viral RNAs are induced by the interferon and JAK-STAT signaling
pathway to suppress coronaviruses.

ZC3HAV1 (ZAP/PARP13) is an ISG and known to restrict the replication of many RNA viruses
such as HIV-1 (Retroviridae), sindbis virus (Togaviridae), and Ebola (Filoviridae) (Goodier et al.,
2015). ZC3HAV1 was previously reported to recognize CpG and recruits decay factors to
degrade HIV RNAs (Takata et al., 2017). ZC3HAV1 acts as a cofactor for TRIM25, an E3
ubiquitin ligase that promotes antiviral signaling mainly through RIG-I (Choudhury et al., 2020;
Gack et al., 2007). Our knockdown results indicate that both ZC3HAV1 and TRIM25 may act as
antiviral factors against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5C). SARS-CoV N protein was previously shown
to interact with the SPRY domain of TRIM25, interfering with the activation of RIG-I (Hu et al.,

2017). Further investigation is needed to understand how ZC3HAV1 and TRIM25 recognize and
suppress SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and if SARS-COV-2 N protein counteracts TRIM25.

PARP12, a cytoplasmic mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) enzyme, is also known to have
broad antiviral activity against RNA viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
(Togaviridae), vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae), Rift Valley fever virus (Phenuiviridae),
encephalomyocarditis virus (Picornaviridae), and Zika virus (Flaviviridae) by multiple
mechanisms including blocking cellular RNA translation (Atasheva et al., 2014; Welsby et al.,
2014) or triggering proteasome-mediated destabilization of viral proteins (Li et al., 2018). ADP
ribosyltransferases are evolutionarily ancient tools used for host-pathogen interactions (Fehr et
al., 2020). Of note, coronavirus nsp3 carries a conserved macrodomain that can remove ADPribose to reverse the activity of PARP enzymes (Fehr et al., 2015). Knockdown of PARP12 and
PARP14 was shown to increase the replication of the macrodomain-deficient mouse hepatitis
virus (MHV) which belongs to the lineage A of genus betacoronavirus (Grunewald et al., 2019)
which is consistent with our knockdown results (Figure 5C). Based on our RNA interactome
data, we hypothesize that the RNA-binding activity of PARP12 and its role in viral RNA
recognition may explain the underlying molecular mechanism of its antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 transcripts.

Other interferon-stimulated RBPs may also be involved in host defense against SARS-CoV-2.
CELF1 (CUGBP1 Elav-like protein family 1) mediates alternative splicing and controls mRNA
stability and translation (Konieczny et al., 2014). CELF1 is required for IFN -mediated


suppression of simian immunodeficiency virus (Retroviridae) (Dudaronek et al., 2007), but its
involvement in other viral infections is unknown. SHFL (Shiftless/RyDEN) was induced
prominently upon viral infection and interferon treatment, and suppressed by JAK inhibitor
(Figure 4). SHFL suppresses the translation of diverse RNA viruses, including dengue virus
(Flaviviridae) and HIV (Retroviridae) (Balinsky et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2016; Wang et al.,
2019). Under our experimental condition, upregulation of viral RNA was only modest in CELF1and SHFL-depleted cells, but further examination is needed as the knockdown efficiency of
ISGs were low in infected cells (Figure S4B), likely because virus-induced interferon response
compromised gene silencing.

Apart from the above RBPs, we identified multiple host factors that have not been previously

upregulation of viral RNAs (Figure 5C), suggesting that LARP1 may have an antiviral function.
LARP1 stabilizes 5 TOP mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors, which
′

contain the 5 terminal oligopyrimidine (5 TOP) motif in the 5 UTR (Philippe et al., 2018).

′

LARP1 also represses the translation of 5 TOP mRNAs in response to metabolic stress in an
′

mTORC1-dependent manner (Hong et al., 2017; Lahr et al., 2017). While much is unknown
regarding the role of LARP1 during viral infection, a recent proteomics study showed that
SARS-CoV-2 N protein binds to LARP1 (Gordon et al., 2020). Based on our RNP capture and
knockdown results, it is conceivable that LARP1 may interfere with viral translation directly via
viral RNA interaction. The role of N protein in the context of LARP1-dependent viral suppression
warrants further investigation. Of note, we cannot exclude the possibility that LARP1 indirectly
regulates SARS-CoV-2 RNAs via the control of 5 TOP mRNAs encoding translation machinery.
′

In fact, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome includes specific components of the 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunits and translational initiation factors (Figure 1F-H). Knockdown experiments
indicated that ribosomal proteins (RPS9 and RPS3) and translation initiation factor EIF4H may
have antiviral activities (Figure 5C). EIF4H along with EIF4B is a cofactor for RNA helicase
EIF4A (Rogers et al., 2001) whose depletion results in RNA granule formation (Tauber et al.,
2020). EIF4H and EIF4B were both identified as the core SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome
(Figure 1F). EIF4H also interacts with SARS-CoV-2 nsp9 (Gordon et al., 2020), so it will be
interesting to investigate the functional consequence of the EIF4H-nsp9 interaction. Together,
our observations implicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be closely intertwined with the
regulation of ribosome biogenesis, metabolic rewiring, and global translational control.

Other translation factors EIF3A, EIF3D, and CSDE1 exhibited proviral effects (Figure 5C).
EIF3A is the RNA-binding component of the mammalian EIF3 complex and evolutionarily
conserved along with EIF3B and EIF3C (Masutani et al., 2007). EIF3D is known to interact with
mRNA cap and is required for specialized translation initiation (Lee et al., 2016). CSDE1 (Unr) is
required for IRES-dependent translation in human rhinovirus (Picornaviridae) and poliovirus
(Picornaviridae) (Anderson et al., 2007; Boussadia et al., 2003). In all, our finding suggests that
SARS-CoV-2 may recruit EIF3D and CSDE1 to respectively regulate cap-dependent and IRESdependent translation initiation (Lee et al., 2017) of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and sgRNAs.

Lastly, the coronaviral RNA interactomes are enriched with RBPs with KH domains (Figure S1D
and Figure S2B) unlike the mRNA interactome. Depletion of FUBP3 (MARTA2) and HDLBP

(Vigilin) increased the viral RNA levels (Figure 5C), hinting at a potential antiviral role of proteins
containing KH domains. HDLBP is a conserved protein that contains 14 KH domains and has
been implicated in viral translation of dengue virus (Ooi et al., 2019). FUBP3 was enriched in all
four RNP capture experiments (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 Probe I/II and OC43 Probe I/II) (Figure 2D).
FUBP3 is a nuclear protein with 4 KH domains and binds to the 3 UTR of cellular mRNAs
′

regulating mRNA localization (Blichenberg et al., 1999; Mukherjee et al., 2019). Its connection
to the life cycle of coronavirus is unknown to our knowledge.

Our current study reveals a broad-spectrum of antiviral factors such as TRIM25, ZC3HAV1,
PARP12, and SHFL and also many RBPs whose functions are unknown in the context of viral
infection such as LARP1, FUBP3, FAM120A/C, EIF4H, RPS3, RPS9, SND1, CELF1, RALY,
CNBP, EIF3A, EIF3D, and CSDE1. This list of proteins reflects constant host-pathogen
interactions and opens new avenues to explore unknown mechanisms of viral life cycle and
immune evasion.

Along with proteins regulating RNAs, it would also be interesting to consider the possibility of
‘riboregulation’ (Hentze et al., 2018) in which RNA controls its interacting proteins. Dengue virus,
for example, uses its subgenomic RNA called sfRNA to sequester TRIM25 (Chapman et al.,
2014). The sgRNA/gRNA ratio is a critical determinant of epidemic potential of dengue virus
(Manokaran et al., 2015). Notably, coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 produces substantial
amounts of noncanonical sgRNAs that may serve as noncoding decoys to interact with host
RBPs to modulate host immune responses (Kim et al., 2020a).

There are over 3,200 human clinical studies listed for the treatment of COVID-19 as of
September 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov), yet there’s no effective antiviral drug or vaccine available
to stop the ongoing pandemic. This unmet medical need highlights our substantial lack of
knowledge of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, redefining antiviral strategies should be contemplated
beyond expeditious drug repurposing efforts. So far, collective large and multidisciplinary
datasets from viral transcriptome (Kim et al., 2020a), host transcriptional response (Blanco-Melo
et al., 2020), ribosome profiling (Finkel et al., 2020), whole proteomics (Bojkova et al., 2020),
protein-protein interactions by co-IP (Gordon et al., 2020) and proximity labeling (St-Germain et
al., 2020), phosphoproteomics (Bouhaddou et al., 2020), RNA structure (Lan et al., 2020),
genome-wide CRISPR screen (Wei et al., 2020), and off-label drug screening (Chen et al., 2020)
have all provided invaluable insights of the underlying biology of this novel human coronavirus.

In line with these efforts, we here present the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome that offers insights
into the host-viral interaction that regulate the life cycle of coronaviruses. Data interpretation in
the context of publicly available orthogonal information has enabled the identification of proviral
and antiviral protein candidates. We expect that further efforts to generate and integrate systemlevel data will elucidate the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and introduce new strategies to
combat COVID-19.

Methods
Preparation of antisense oligonucleotide templates
By scanning the genomic RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI RefSeq accession NC_045512.2) and
HCoV-OC43 (GenBank accession AY391777.1) from head to tail, partially overlapping 90 nt
tiles were enumerated. These tiles were designed to have 30 nt spacing, so adjacent tiles share
a subsequence of 60 nt. To avoid ambiguous targeting, tiles were aligned to the human
transcriptome (version of Oct 14, 2019) using bowtie 2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and
multi-mapped sequences were discarded. To prepare biotinylated antisense oligonucleotides
(ASOs) in bulk, the sequence elements for in vitro transcription (IVT), reverse transcription (RT)
and PCR were added to the 90 nt tiles. The T7 promoter (5 -TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG′

3 ) and a pad for RT priming (5 -TGG AAT TCT CGG GTG CCA AGG-3 ) were added to the
′

′

′

head and tail of each tile, respectively. We grouped ASOs into two sets for each viral genome:
“Probe I” targets the unique region of genomic RNA ([265:21553] of NC_045512.2; [:21506] of
AY391777.1) and “Probe II” aims at both genomic and subgenomic RNAs ([21562:] of
NC_045512.2; [21506:] of AY391777.1). The templates of four ASO groups have distinct PCR
primer binding sites on both ends. Accordingly, each ASO set can be selectively amplified from
a single mixture. The final ASO templates (167 nt) were prepared via the oligo pool synthesis
service of Genscript and stored at −80˚C. The ASO templates used in this study are listed in
Table S2.

Mass production of biotin-labeled ASO
ASO templates were amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) and PCR primers
for an ASO pool. PCR products were purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). RNA
intermediates were then transcribed using 5X MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Invitrogen), and
DNA templates were degraded by TURBO DNase (Invitrogen). To clean up enzymes and other
reagents, 1.8× reaction volume of AMPure XP (Beckman) was applied and polyethylene glycol
was added to be final 20%. The size selection was carried out according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Biotinylated ASOs were synthesized by RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo
Scientific) and 5 biotin-TEG primer. RNA intermediates were hydrolyzed at 0.1 M NaOH and

neutralized with acetic acid. Finally, ASO purification was performed in the same manner as IVT

Table S6.

Compilation of proteome databases
The Uniprot reference proteome sets for human (UP000005640, canonical, SwissProt) and
African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus; UP000029965, canonical, SwissProt and
TrEMBL) were used to identify host proteins in each mass spectrometry experiment (version
03/21/2020) (UniProt Consortium, 2019). The reference proteome set for the Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was manually curated largely based on the
NCBI Reference Sequence (NC_045512.2) and related literature of other accessory proteins
(e.g. ORF3b, ORF9b and ORF9c). The reference proteome set for the Human coronavirus
OC43 (HCoV-OC43) was compiled based on the Uniprot Swiss-Prot proteins for HCoV-OC43
(taxonomy:31631) except for HCoV-OC43 Protein I which was separated into Protein Ia and
Protein Ib (or N2) (Vijgen et al., 2005).

Cell culture, transfection and virus infection
Virus experiments were carried out in accordance with the biosafety guideline by the Korea
Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC). The Institutional Biosafety Committee of
Seoul National University (SNUIBC) approved the protocols used in this study, including
SNUIBC-R200331-1-1 for BL2 experiments and SNUIBC-200508-1 for BL3 experiments. Vero

uninfected cells, 48 hours after transfection into 96 well plates in triplicates and cell number was
measured by MTT assay (Promega) at 4 hours after addition of tetrazolium dye.

RNA purification and RT-qPCR
For total RNA purification from virus-infected cells, 1 mL TRIzol LS (Invitorgen) were added to
media-removed cell monolayers per single well of 12 well plates followed by on-column DNA
digestion and purification (Zymo Research). For RNA purification from RNP capture sample,
bead-captured RNAs were digested with 100 ng Proteinase K (PCR grade, Roche) and
incubated at 37˚C for 1 hour, followed by RNA isolation by TRIzol LS with GlycoBlue
(Invitrogen). 1~5 µg RNA were reverse-transcribed using RevertAid transcriptase (Thermo
Scientific) and random hexamer. qPCR was performed with primer pairs listed in Table S6 and
PowerSYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed with QuantStudio 5 (Thermo Scientific).

Modified RNA antisense purification coupled with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS)
Virus infected cells were detached from culture vessels by trypsin and cell pellets were
resuspended with ice-cold PBS. 12 mL cell suspensions were dispersed in 150 mm dishes to
irradiate 254 nm UV for 2.5 J/cm using BIO-LINK BLX-254 for SARS-CoV-2 or 0.8 J/cm using

Spectrolinker XL-1500 for HCoV-OC43. UV-crosslinked cells were pelleted by centrifugation
and resuspended in TURBO DNase solution (150 Units per flask) and incubated at 37˚C for 30
minutes. DNA digested cells were supplemented with equal volume of pre-heated 2X lysis
buffer (40 mM Tris-Cl at pH 7.5, 1 M LiCl, 1% LDS, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT and 8 M urea) and
denatured by incubating at 68°C for 30 minutes. Per replicate, cell lysate from 1 flask (T-175)
were mixed with 20 µg biotin probe pools (Probe I or Probe II) and hybridized by incubating at
68˚C for 30 minutes in final 1 mL volume. Biotin-labeled RNP lysates were supplemented with
streptavidin beads (1 mL per replicate, New England Biolabs) and captured by rotating at room
temperature overnight. Probe-enriched RNP beads were washed with 1X lysis buffer twice and
transferred to fresh tubes, followed by final wash with detergent-free wash buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl
at pH 7.5, 0.5 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA). 1/10 of beads were set aside for assessment of RNA
th

contents by RT-qPCR and another 1/10 of beads were used for silver staining (KOMA biotech).
th

The remaining 8/10 of beads were digested with 100 units of Benzonase nuclease (Millipore) at
th

37°C for 1 hour. For on-bead peptide digestion, nuclease treated beads were suspended to final
8 M urea and reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), alkylated with 40 mM iodoacetamide

(IAA) for 1 hour each at 37°C, and diluted with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) to final 1
M urea. These bead suspensions were supplemented with 300 ng Trypsin (Thermo Scientific,
MS grade) and 1 mM CaCl and digested overnight at 37°C. Peptide solutions were separated
2

from magnetic beads and further processed with HiPPR detergent removal spin columns
(Thermo Scientific) and desalted by reverse phase C18 ziptip (Millipore). After the clean up and
dry down, the samples were reconstituted with 20 μL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer
for LC-MS/MS analysis.

LC-MS/MS analysis
LC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid MS (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) coupled with nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters). Both analytical capillary columns
(100 cm x 75 µm i.d.) and the trap columns (3 cm x 150 µm i.d) were packed in-house with 3 µm
Jupiter C18 particles (Phenomenex, Torrance). The long analytical column was placed in a
column heater (Analytical Sales and Services) regulated to a temperature of 45°C. The LC flow
rate was 300 nL/min and the 100‐min linear gradient ranged from 95% solvent A (H O with 0.1%
2

formic acid (Merck)) to 40% solvent B (100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). Precursor ions
were acquired at 120 K resolving power at m/z 200 and the isolation of precursor for MS/MS
analysis was performed with a 1.4 Th. Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with 30%
collision energy was used for sequencing with a target value of 1E5 ions determined by
automatic gain control. Resolving power for acquired MS2 spectra was set to 30 K at m/z 200
with 120 ms maximum injection time.

Mass spectrometric raw data files were processed for Label-Free Quantification with MaxQuant
(version 1.6.15.0) (Cox and Mann, 2008) using the built-in Andromeda search engine (Cox et al.,
2011) at default settings with a few exceptions. Briefly, for peptide-spectrum match (PSM)
search, cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modifications, and methionine oxidation
and N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Tolerance for the first and main
PSM search were 20 and 4.5 ppm, respectively. Peptides from common contaminant proteins
were identified by utilizing the contaminant database provided by MaxQuant. FDR threshold of 1%
was used for both the peptide and protein level. The match-between-runs option was enabled
with default parameters in the identification step. Finally, LFQ was performed for those with a
minimum ratio count of 1.

Statistical analysis for RNP capture experiment
To identify host and viral proteins that interact with the particular RNA species of interest (e.g.
sgRNA or gRNA), we utilized the results from the “bead only” and “probe only” samples as
technical backgrounds. Specifically, the “bead only” (or no-probe) experiment in infected cells
was used to account for non-specific interactors and biotin-containing carboxylases (e.g. PCCA,
ACACA, and ACACB) and determine the set of host and viral proteins that in a broad sense
bind to the RNA, which we call Probe I/II “binding” proteins. The probe experiment in uninfected
cells (i.e. “probe only”) was then used as the technical background against target RNAindependent interactors and determine the set of host proteins that are enriched for the target
RNA, which we call Probe I/II “enriched” proteins.

To accomplish this, we considered the protein spectra count data as a multinomial distribution
and applied a statistical test for spectra count enrichment. Specifically, let Np be the number of
identified spectra counts for protein group p from the case experiment (e.g. Probe I experiment
in infected cells), and Mp be the respective count number from the control experiment (e.g. noprobe experiment in infected cells). For each protein i with Ni

Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to adjust the p-values and control the false discovery
rate.

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis
We conducted enrichment analyses of Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Gene Ontology Consortium,
2001) by means of summarizing the function of tens of host proteins identified in the RNP
capture experiment. In general, Fisher's exact test is used to estimate the statistical significance
of the association (i.e. contingency) between a particular GO term and the gene set of interest.

To improve the explanatory power of this analysis, we used the weight01 algorithm (Alexa et al.,
2006) from the topGO R package which accounts for the GO graph structure and reduces local
dependencies between GO terms. Detailed information of the Gene Ontology was from the
GO.db R package (version 3.8.2), and GO gene annotations were from the org.Hs.eg.db R
package (version 3.8.2).

Protein-protein interaction network analysis
We integrated protein-protein interaction data from the BioGRID database (Release 3.5.187)
(Stark et al., 2006) and retrieved other proteins that do not necessarily bind to the SARS-CoV-2
RNA but form either transient or stable physical interactions with the host proteins identified
from the RNP capture experiments. In detail, we considered only human protein-protein
interactions that were (1) found from at least two different types of experiments and (2) reported
by at least three publication records which resulted in a total of 65,625 interactions covering
12,143 human proteins. Physical interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human
proteins were by affinity capture and mass spectrometry in SARS-CoV-2 protein expressing
cells (Gordon et al., 2020). The network R package and the ggnet2 function of the GGally R
package was used for graph visualization.

Protein domain enrichment analysis
Pfam database (version 33.1) (El-Gebali et al., 2019) was used for protein domain enrichment
analysis. Taxon 9606 (human) and Taxon 60711 (green monkey) protein domain annotations
were used to analyze RNP capture results of HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, respectively. Onesided Fisher's exact test was applied to estimate the statistical enrichment of a particular protein
domain for the specific gene set (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 Probe I binding proteins). We utilized the set
of all proteins identified in the RNP capture experiments and all protein domains annotated to
those proteins as the statistical background of the enrichment analysis.

Subcellular localization analysis
To investigate the subcellular localizations of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome, we leveraged the
protein subcellular localization information from the Human cell map database v1 (Go et al.,
2019). Information from the SAFE algorithm was used primarily but then supplemented by

information from the NMF algorithm in case of "no prediction" or "-" localizations.. Localization
terms of the NMF algorithm were matched to terms of the SAFE algorithm in general, but few
were mapped to the higher term of the SAFE algorithm. For example, the “cell junction” term of
the NMF algorithm was merged to the “cell junction, plasma membrane” term of the SAFE
algorithm.
