Abstract
The novel ÔÅ¢-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 101 million people and resulted in 2.2
million death worldwide. Recent epidemiological studies suggested that some
environmental factors, such as air pollution, might be the important contributors to the
mortality of COVID-19. However, how environmental exposure enhances the severity of
COVID-19 remains to be fully understood. In the present report, we provide evidence
showing that mdig, a previously reported environmentally-induced oncogene that
antagonizes repressive trimethylation of histone proteins, is a master regulator for SARSCoV-2 receptors neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and NRP2, cathepsins, glycan metabolism and
inflammation, key determinants for viral infection and cytokine storm of the patients.
Depletion of mdig in bronchial epithelial cells by CRISPR-Cas-9 gene editing resulted in
a decreased expression of NRP1, NRP2, cathepsins, and genes involved in protein
glycosylation and inflammation, largely due to a substantial enrichment of lysine 9 and/or
lysine 27 trimethylation of histone H3 (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) on these genes as
determined by ChIP-seq. These data, accordingly, suggest that mdig is a key mediator
for the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure and targeting mdig
may be one of the effective strategies in ameliorating the symptom and reducing the
mortality of COVID-19.

Introduction
The global outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the newly identified SARS-CoV-2
virus, is having a devastating impact on both public health and social economics.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of January 30, 2021, there had
been more than 101 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, leading to almost
2.2 million deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a large number of trimeric spikes (S) on
its surface. Each S protein has two subdomains, S1 and S2. Upon direct binding of S1 to
the ACE2 on the surface of the host cells, membrane-associated proteases of the host
cells, including furin, TMPRSS2, and others, cleave S proteins at the RRAR/S motif
located at the S1-S2 boundary, or the motif of PSKR/S, the so-called S2‚Äô site, in S2 region,
followed by S2-mediated membrane fusion 1,2. In addition to ACE2, the C-terminal RRAR
motif of the S1 protein from the cleaved S protein may bind to cell surface neuropilin-1
(NRP1) or NRP2 for sufficient viral entry into the host cells

3-5.

After membrane fusion,

the virus is shuttled in the cytoplasm through the endosomes and lysosomes, during
which several cathepsin family proteases cleave S proteins further and other viral proteins,
leading to the release of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 into the cytoplasm 2. Indeed,
some inhibitors targeting endosome, lysosome or cathepsin, such as ammonia chloride,
bafilomycin A and teicoplanin, had been shown to be effective in blocking viral entry in
cell-based experiments

2,6.

The viral RNA genome can hijack the protein translational

machinery of the host cells for the expression of viral polyproteins that can be processed
to generate replicase, proteases, transcriptases, and other viral structural proteins for
assembly of the new virion. Some of these newly generated viral proteins can antagonize
the anti-viral responses of the interferon signaling, whereas others are highly capable of

activating the inflammasome for cytokine storm and pyroptosis of the host cells in the lung
and other organs, leading to an increased likelihood of fatality of the COVID-19 patients
7.

Both S protein and ACE2 are known to be extensively glycosylated through
covalently linked oligosaccharides (glycans). It is believed that glycosylation may
enhance the infectivity of the virus. Many glycoconjugates on the surface of the host cells
are also modified by sialic acid, a specific form of glycosylation--sialylation, which may
facilitate membrane fusion of the virus and cells. It is also very likely that alteration in
ACE2 and membrane glycan profile may determine the inter-individual variation on the
outcomes of viral infection 8.
Human lung is the first line of attack by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fatality of
COVID-19 has been largely attributed to the massive alveolar damage and progressive
respiratory failure resulted from cellular fibromyxoid exudates, formation of hyaline
(hyaluronan) membrane, pulmonary oedema, inflammation, and interstitial fibrosis

9-11.

Most environmental risk factors, such as air pollution and PM2.5, can induce chronic
inflammation and make the lung more vulnerable to viral attacks. Indeed, a recent
nationwide epidemiological study in the US had shown that an increase of only 1 ùúág/m3
in PM2.5 is associated with an 8% increase in the COVID-19 death rate, clearly indicating
that environmental factors may contribute to the severity of the disease outcomes among
individuals with COVID-19

12.

This notion is complementarily supported by the fact that

the areas, such as Lombardy, Emilia-Romanga, Piemonte, and Veneto of Italy, and
Madrid of Spain, with worse air quality due to higher level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), are
the hardest-hit areas with deaths from COVID-19 13.

The mineral dust-induced gene mdig was first identified in alveolar macrophages
from people with chronic lung diseases associated with occupational exposure

14,

and

additional studies concluded that mdig can be induced by a number of environmental
hazards, such as silica particles, arsenic, tobacco smoke, and PM2.5

14.

This gene was

independently discovered as myc-induced nuclear antigen (mina53) and nucleolar protein
NO52, respectively. Functional tests suggested that mdig may have hydroxylase activity
on ribosomal protein L27a, and accordingly, an alternative name, Riox2, was given

14.

The mdig protein contains a conserved JmjC domain that was considered as a signature
motif of the histone demethylase family members. In human bronchial epithelial cells, lung
cancer cell line A549, and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells, knockout of mdig
gene by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, resulted in a pronounced enrichment of histone H3
lysine9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) as well as H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 in ChIP-seq
analysis, esp. in the gene loci encoding proteins in inflammation and fibrosis, such H19,
TGFÔÅ¢ signaling, collagens, and cell adhesion molecules

15.

Data from mice with

heterozygotic deletion of mdig gene indicated that mdig is a master regulator of
inflammation and tissue fibrosis

15,16.

In the present report, we further demonstrated that

mdig may exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 in response to environmental exposure.

Results
Depletion of mdig prevents cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
We had used non-cancerous bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B to establish
mdig knockout (KO) cells through CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, and used the cells
subjected to gene editing but without mdig depletion as wild type (WT) cells

15.

By

transfection of the WT and KO cells with an expression vector for the full-length spike (S)
protein of SARS-CoV-2, a detectable decrease in S protein cleavage was noted in the
mdig KO cells (Fig. 1A, top panel). The molecular weight (MW) of the unprocessed fulllength S protein is around 200 kDa (green arrow), and the cleaved product is about 100110 kDa (red arrow). To determine whether the decreased cleavage of S protein in mdig
KO cells is a result of the diminished expression of proteases responsible for S protein
cleavage, we compared the protein levels of cathepsin D (CTSD), transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS2), and furin between WT and mdig KO cells. There is no
measurable difference in the levels of TMPRSS2 and furin. However, a substantial
decrease of CTSD, both the 46 kDa precursor and 28 kDa mature form, was observed in
the mdig KO cells (Fig. 1A). In another cell line, the triple-negative breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 cell, we noted that CTSD is the most diminished protein when mdig was
knocked out in this cell line (data not shown).
To additionally investigate the effect of mdig knockout on the genes linked to
SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathology, we performed gene expression profiling between
WT and mdig KO cells by two independent RNA-seq analyses. The differentially
expressed genes identified in both sets of RNA-seq data were then subjected to gene set
enrichment analysis with the Enrichr web-based application. This analysis showed that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

the down-regulated genes in the mdig KO cells were over-presented in the gene sets
induced by SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal organoids (GSE149312), cardiomyocytes
(GSE150392), A549 cells (GSE147507), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of
COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1B), suggesting that mdig enhances expression of genes
involved in either SARS-CoV-2 infection or the pathogenesis of COVID-19, To further
understand the biological functions of the down-regulated genes identified in RNA-seq in
mdig KO cells, we applied enrichment assay of the Reactome. In this analysis, we found
that the top Reactome pathways of these down-regulated genes in mdig KO cells are
related to organization, interaction and regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) (Fig. 1C).
Unexpectedly, six of the twenty-two top-ranked Reactome pathways are centered on
protein glycosylation or glycan metabolism, indicating that in addition to ECM, mdig is
critical for the post-translational modification of proteins by carbohydrate moieties.
Involvement of mdig in antagonizing H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3
A previous study showed that knockout of mdig in BEAS-2B cells caused
significant enrichments of H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 on the merged peak
regions as determined by ChIP-seq 15. Re-analysis of the ChIP-seq data from the WT and
mdig KO cells by pairwise Pearson correlation analyses, through plotting the tag numbers
of H3K4me3, H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in the promoter region in mdig KO cells against
the corresponding tag numbers in WT cells, revealed a significant enhancement of
H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 in gene promoters in mdig KO cells (Fig. 2A). Clustered
heatmaps as depicted in Fig. 2B suggested that the enrichment of H3K9me3 and
H3K27me3 were drastically enhanced in clusters 2 and 3 of the mdig KO cells, while little
to no changes in the enrichment of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 were observed in clusters

1, 4 and 5. The enhanced H3K9me3 in mdig KO cells was also supported by the
significantly increased number of H3K9me3 peaks in ChIP-seq. In WT cells, the
normalized number of H3K9me3 peaks is 12,094, whereas in KO cells, this number is
32,264 (data not shown). To determine which sets of genes are enriched with H3K9me3
in mdig KO cells, we conducted Reactome pathway assay for those H3K9me3-enriched
genes. It is interesting to note that the top-ranked pathways are mostly associated with
protein glycosylation and glycan regulation (Fig. 2C), which is highly correlated to the
pathways of the down-regulated genes in RNA-seq of the mdig KO cells (Fig. 1C). These
data, thus, provide an unequivocal evidence indicating that mdig fosters the expression
of genes in glycosylation and glycan metabolism through antagonizing the repressive
histone methylation marker H3K9me3 as well as H3K27me3.
Receptors and proteases required for SARS-CoV-2 infection are regulatory
targets of mdig
Considering the fact that knockout of mdig reduced cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)
protein (Fig.1A), we narrowed down our analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to several key
proteins important for S protein binding, intracellular vesicle trafficking and fusion. Upon close
examination, we found that genes involved in key aspects of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host
cells, including NRP1, NRP2, DPP4, TMPRSS15, RAB6B, IQGAP2, and others, are enriched with
the repressive histone trimethylation marker, H3K9me3 or H3K27me3, along with a decreased
expression of these genes as determined by RNA-seq, in mdig KO cells (Fig. 3A). NRP1 and
NRP2 are transmembrane proteins serving as receptors for growth factors and semaphorins.
Recent reports suggest that NRP1 or NRP2 can function as SARS-CoV-2 receptor through
binding of the C-terminal RRAR motif of the furin-cleaved S protein, followed by internalization of
the virus via micropinocytosis 3,4. Knockout of mdig raised H3K9me3 in the up- and down-stream

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

of NRP1 gene, and H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 in the gene body and down-stream of NRP2 gene,
which are consistent with the diminished gene expression as determined by RNA-seq (Fig. 3A).
Meanwhile, a drastic reduction of H3K4me3, an active transcription marker, was observed on
both NRP1 and NRP2 genes in mdig KO cells, which further enforced the transcriptional
suppression of NRP1 and NRP2 by an increased level of H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3. The role
of mdig on NRP1 was also confirmed in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and A549 lung
cancer cells. Knockout of mdig enhanced enrichment of H3K9me3 in the upstream of NRP1 gene,
and H4K20me3, another repressive histone methylation marker, in the gene body and upstream
of the NRP1 gene in MDA-MB-231 cells (sFig. 1), which correlated to a 2.5-fold decrease of the
NRP1 protein in the KO cells as determined by quantitative proteomics (sFig.2). In A549 cells,
knockout of mdig resulted in an enhancement of H4K20me3 in the down-stream of the NRP1
gene (sFig. 3). The mdig KO cells also exhibited reduced expression of DPP4 and TMPRSS15
due to intensified enrichment of H3K9me3 on these genes. DPP4 serves as a receptor for MERSCoV and possibly for SARS-CoV-2 too 17. Inhibitors of DPP4 conferred a 7-fold lower risk of

COVID-19 mortality among patients with metabolic diseases

18.

TMPRSS15 shares high

homology in the serine protease domains of TMPRSS2, thus, may participate in the cleavage of
the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 during infection. Both RAB6B and IQGAP2 are important regulators
for lysosome-phagosome tethering and endocytic vesicle trafficking or fusion

19

. Thus, the

enhanced enrichment of H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3 on and down-regulation of these genes in
mdig KO cells suggest that mdig may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection through antagonizing the
repressive histone methylation markers H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, leading to an upregulated
expression of these genes. This notion is further supported by the decreased expression of the
cathepsin (CTS) family members due to enhanced enrichment of H3K9me3 on these genes in
mdig KO cells (Fig. 3B). Knockout of mdig caused strong enrichments of H3K27me3 and
H3K9me3 in the up-stream of CTSD gene, which is consistent to the diminished CTSD protein in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

mdig KO cells as shown in Fig. 1A. Increased level of H3K9me3 was also seen on the gene
bodies of CTSE, CTSL1, CTSL3P, and CTSL1P8 in mdig KO cells (Fig. 3B). Results from RNAseq showed that except CTSF, the expression levels of all other members of the CTS family are
significantly declined following mdig knockout (Fig. 3C). It had been well-documented that CTS
members are the dominating proteases for further degradation of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins in
lysosomes 20,21, which is essential for the release of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm.

The expression of the major glycosylation pathway genes is mdig dependent
Glycosylation creates great structural and functional diversity of the target proteins.
During SARS-CoV-2 infection, glycosylation of the viral proteins is essential for the
assembly of the virion and is able to shield the virus from the host immune response. One
of the major glycosylation pathways is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) from
glycolytic metabolism of the glucose, which generates uridine diphosphate Nacetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), the founding molecule for N- and O-glycosylation,
sialylation, formation of hyaluronan, and biosynthesis of glycosylposphatidylinosital (GPI)
(Fig. 4A). In the mdig KO cells, we observed a strong enrichment of the repressive histone
marker, H3K9me3, on the genes in this pathway, such as ST3GAL1 (Fig. 4B) and HAS3
(Fig. 4C). RNA-seq confirmed a decreased expression of these two genes and other
genes as indicated in Fig. 4A. Interestingly, most of the GalNAc kinases (GALs) that
exhibited increased enrichment of H3K9me3 or H3K27me3 in ChIP-seq, are downregulated as determined by RNA-seq in the mdig KO cells (Fig. 4D). Accordingly, we
believe that in the normal cells, induction of mdig will enforce the overall glycosylation for
both viral and host cell proteins.
Mdig is a master regulator of inflammation

Inflammatory cytokine storm is the most important mortality factor of COVID-19
patients. Our recently published data demonstrated that mdig controls the expression of
genes involved in inflammation, including TGFÔÅ¢ signaling, collagens and cell adhesion
molecules

14,15.

In addition, heterzygotic knockout of mdig in mice ameliorated silica-

induced lung fibrosis along with a significant decrease of Th17 cell and macrophage
infiltration into the lung interstitium 15,16. Re-analyzing of the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data
from the WT and mdig KO cells further unraveled that mdig regulates a wide spectrum of
inflammatory genes, such as several receptor genes for IL17 and IL1 (Figs. 5A and 5B).
Knockout of mdig caused an elevated enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, both are
repressive markers for gene transcription, on IL17RD. Meanwhile, the expression of some
TLR and NLRP members involved in inflammasome-mediated inflammation are also
compromised in the mdig KO cells (Figs. 5C and 5D). On the genes encoding
prostaglandin E2 receptors 2, 3 and 4, although there was no significant gain of H3K9me3
and H3K27me3, a notable reduction of H3K4me3, an active marker for gene transcription,
on these genes was observed in the KO cells (Fig. 5C).
Elevated expression of mdig in pulmonary fibrosis
Pulmonary fibrosis is one of the major contributing factors to the acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) of the COVID-19 patients, which is also a common sequela in
some COVID-19 survivors

22,23.

Many fibrotic damages are irreversible and may cause

lifelong functional impairment of the lung. The pro-fibrotic role of mdig was first
demonstrated in silica-induced lung fibrosis in mice

14-16.

It is unknown whether mdig is

also important in the development of lung fibrosis in humans. To answer this question,
we screened mdig expression through immunohistochemistry in tissue microarrays

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

containing 17 normal human lung tissues and 26 cases of fibrotic lung tissues collected
from patients with cancer, chronic bronchitis or chronic pneumonia. In agreement with
earlier reports that mdig was barely detectable in normal lung tissue 24,25, in this analysis,
only 24% of normal lung tissues showed some faint staining of mdig. In contrast, the
majority of fibrotic lung tissues, 85%, exhibited a strong signal of mdig expression (Fig.
6). Although we cannot distinguish the question of whether mdig promoted fibrosis or
fibrosis caused a higher expression of mdig in human lung tissues, based on previous
mouse model with mdig knockout and the fact that mdig is a master regulator of
inflammation

14-16,

we believe that mdig is a critical driving factor for the development of

lung fibrosis associated with some disease conditions, such as COVID-19, chronic
bronchitis, pneumonia, and cancer.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 infection has many destructive
effects on public health and social-economics on a global scale. Despite a large amount
of molecular detail is known about the virology of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathology of
COVID-19, little is currently known about why some COVID-19 patients showed mild or
no symptoms but others, even who are at young ages and have no pre-existing disease
conditions, have severe or fatal outcomes. A number of studies had demonstrated that
several environmental factors, including air pollution, temperature, humidity, wind speed,
etc. had a significant influence on the mortality of COVID-19 12,13,26. However, to the best
of our knowledge, no detailed studies have investigated how these suspected
environmental factors intensify the severity or mortality of COVID-19. In this report, we
provided evidence suggesting that mdig, a potential oncogenic gene induced by several
common environmental hazards

14,27,

may augment the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and

the severity of COVID-19 through upregulating S protein receptors NRP1 and NRP2,
several proteases and the genes in the pathways of glycan metabolism and inflammation.
It has been a general assumption that ACE2 is abundantly expressed in bronchial
epithelial cells and other lung cells, and serves as the main receptor for the S protein of
SARS-CoV-2 28. It was beyond our expectation that ACE2 was barely detected by RNAseq in both WT and mdig KO BEAS-2B cells, a cell line derived from non-cancerous
bronchial epithelial cells. Although we cannot rule out the possibility of genetic or
epigenetic variations during the establishment and passage of the cell lines, there is an
evidence showing very low protein levels of ACE2 in respiratory epithelial cells

29.

Accordingly, it is very likely that NRP1 and NRP2 are critically required for efficient viral

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.31.429010; this version posted February 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

entry into the host cells in the lung. The dependence of mdig on the expression of NRP1
and NRP2 was also observed in two additional cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (sFig.1 and sFig.
2) and A549 (sFig. 3). Thus, it is plausible to speculate that mdig dependent expression
of NRP1 and NRP2 can enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the worsening
effect of environmental exposure on the severity of COVID-19.
Sequential cleavage of the S protein at S1-S2 boundary and S2‚Äô site by host
proteases is a prerequired step for conformational changes and membrane fusion of the
S protein, followed by viral internalization and intracellular trafficking within endosomes
and lysosomes. Inside the lysosomes, the S proteins on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 will
be subjected to additional cleavages by cathepsins, primarily by CTSL and CTSB. A
number of studies concluded that inhibitors that target lysosome or the lysosomal
proteases, cathepsins, can prevent the release of the viral RNA genome into the host
cytoplasm and viral entry into the target cells 30. Decreased expression of CTSB, CTSD,
CTSE, and CTSL members in the mdig KO cells suggests that mdig bolsters the
expression of proteases required for additional cleavage of the S protein, which provides
a permissive environment for SARS-CoV-2 propagation.
Both S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 are highly glycosylated

31.

Certainly,

glycosylation changes the antigenicity of S protein and its affinity towards cellular
receptors. Meanwhile, membrane fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with the host cells is
strengthened by some types of glycosylation of the cell surface proteins, such as
sialylation 32. More importantly, in addition to intensify the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2,
amplified glycosylation resulted from the excessive generation of hyaluronan that forms
liquid jelly-like structure in both alveolar space and the interstitial area is fatal for COVID-

19 patients

33.

Inflammatory cytokine storm is one of the contributing factors for the

excessive generation of hyaluronan based on the fact that these cytokines are strong
inducers of hyaluronan synthase-2 (HAS2)

34.

The present report unfolded that mdig is

largely responsible for the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the key component
of the inflammasome, as well as most of the genes in glycan metabolism, such as Has1,
Has2 and Has3 for hyaluronan generation, and GALs for O-glycosylation (Fig. 4). These
effects of mdig are also attributable to the pulmonary fibrosis among some COVID-19
survivals 22,23. The elevated level of mdig in fibrotic human lung tissues (Fig. 6) supports
this notion. Thus, over-expression of mdig, either under some chronic disease conditions
or environmental exposure, possibly indicates the pathogenetic mechanism behind the
severity or mortality of COVID-19. It also yields a conceivable explanation of how
environmental exposure exacerbates the severity and/or mortality of COVID-19. A more
complete understanding of mdig or its regulatory pathways, accordingly, could catalyze
effective management strategies that will ameliorate the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and
improve the outcomes of the COVID-19 patients.

Materials and methods
Cell culture
The human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were purchased from America Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). BEAS-2B cells were cultured in DMEM-high glucose medium
(Sigma, cat.no. D5796) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco,
cat.no. 15140122), and 1% L-Glutamine (Gibco, cat.no. 25030164). Cells were
maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 ¬∞C with 5% CO2.
Establishment of mdig knockout (KO) cells by CRISPR-Cas9
For generation of CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids, sgRNA (5‚Äô-AATGTGTACATAACTCCCGC-3‚Äô)
was selected and cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Blast vector as described

15.

BEAS-2B

cells (2.5 x 105/well in 6-well plate) were transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids by
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol.
The transfected cells were selected with 2 ¬µg/ml Blasticidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
until single colonies were formed. WT and mdig KO colonies were validated by measuring
mdig protein expression.
SARS-CoV2-Spike transfection
WT and mdig KO cells (3 x 105/well in 6-well plate) were seeded, and grown to 70%
confluence. SARS-CoV2-Spike plasmids (Addgene, cat.no. 145032) were transfected
into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the
manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were subjected to
western blotting.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in 1 x RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling), supplemented with 1mM PMSF and

protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentrations were
determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Whole cell
lysates (30 ¬µg) were separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then transferred to Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and then
probed with primary antibodies at 4¬∞C overnight. The primary antibodies include anti-mdig
(Invitrogen cat.no. 39-7300), anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike (Abcam, ab272504), anti-Furin
(Abcam, ab183495), anti-TMPRSS2 (Proteintech, cat.no. 14437-1-AP), anti-Cathepsin D
(Cell signaling, cat.no. 2284S), and anti-GAPDH (Cell signaling, cat.no. 2118S). After
washing with TBST (3 √ó 10 min), the membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG at room temperature for 1h and
washed with TBST (3 √ó 10 min). Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was used to detect immunoblotting signals.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq)
Ten million WT or KO Beas-2B cells were fixed and subjected to ChIP with ChIP-grade
antibodies against H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3 (Active Motif, CA). ChIP,
input/control DNA libraries, NGS sequencing, and data analysis were performed as we
previously described 15.
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
Two million WT or KO BEAS-2B cells were collected for total RNA isolation, libraries
preparation and NGS sequencing. The procedures and data analysis were followed as
we previously reported 15.

Pulmonary Interstitial Fibrosis tissue microarray LC561 was purchased from the
USBiomax, Inc. Tissue microarray slides were processed for immunohistochemical
staining for mdig as described previously

24.

Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections

were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated in a series of alcohol gradients. To quench
endogenous peroxidase activity, slides were incubated with 1.5 to 3% H 2O2 in PBS for
20 min at room temperature. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed by boiling
tissue sections in citrate buffer with pH 6.0 for 20 min in a microwave. To block nonspecific
binding of immunoglobulin, slides were incubated with a solution containing 5% goat
serum, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with
primary antibodies against mdig (mouse anti-MINA, Invitrogen with 1:50 dilution)
overnight at 4 ¬∞C. Goat anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibodies were subsequently
applied at 1:200 dilution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were then
incubated with ABC reagent (Vectastatin Elite ABC kit) for 45 min at room temperature,
and the chromogen was developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and mounted with
Entellan¬Æ (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). All incubation steps were carried
out in a humidified chamber, and all washing steps were performed with 1 √ó PBS. Images
were captured under the bright field of a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S Inverted microscope (Mager
Scientific, Dexter MI, USA) and analyzed using Nikon‚Äôs NIS Elements BR 3.2 software.
Statistics and data analysis
Expression profiles of GSE149312, GSE150392, and GSE147507 were obtained from
the public NCBI-GEO database. Gene set enrichment analyses comparing RNA-seq
analyses

A. Western blotting shows decreased cleavage of the transfected SARS-CoV-2 S
protein and the expression of CTSD in BEAS-2B cells. B. Down-regulated genes in
the mdig KO cells as determined by RNA-seq are highly represented for those gene
induced by SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal organoids (GSE149312), cardiomyocytes
(GSE150392), A549 cells (GSE147507), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)
of COVID-19 patients. C. Reactome pathway assay shows the down-regulated
genes in mdig KO cells as determined by RNA-seq are mostly in the pathways of
extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation and glycan metabolism (highlighted in yellow).
