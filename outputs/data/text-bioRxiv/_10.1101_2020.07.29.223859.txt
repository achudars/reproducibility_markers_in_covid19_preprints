ABSTRACT
Timely control of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) at the severe stage of COVID-19 is
key to improving the treatment success and reducing the mortality rate. The inhibition of the
activity of the two key cytokines, IFNγ and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the
development of the cytokine storm. The objective of our investigations is to reveal the antiinflammatory potential of heparin for prevention and suppression of the development of CRS in
acute COVID-19 patients.
The effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on IFNγ signalling inside the stimulated
WISH cells was investigated by measuring its antiproliferative activity and the translocation of
phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus. The mechanism of heparin binding to IFNγ and IL-6 and
therefore inhibition of their activity was studied by means of extensive molecular-dynamics
simulations. We find that LMWH binds with high affinity to IFNγ and is able to inhibit fully the
interaction with its cellular receptor. It also influences the biological activity of IL-6 by binding to
either IL-6 or IL-6/IL-6R thus preventing the formation of the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 signaling
complex. Our conclusion is that heparin is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that can be used in
acute inflammatory conditions, due to its potential to inhibit both IFN and IL-6 signalling
pathways. Based on our results and available clinical observations, we suggest the administration
of LMWH to COVID-19 patients in the initial stages of the acute phase. The beginning of the
treatment and the dosage should be based on a careful follow-up of the platelet count and the Ddimer, IL-6, IFN, T-cells, and B-cells levels.

1. Introduction
COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [1], accounts so far for
over 16 million cases worldwide and more than 650000 deaths. The majority of COVID-19
patients have no or only mild symptoms. However, about 15% of them develop severe symptoms
and many require intensive care treatment. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be roughly divided into
three stages: stage I, an asymptomatic incubation period with or without detectable virus; stage II,
a non-severe symptomatic period; stage III, severe respiratory symptomatic stage with a high viral
load [2]. Until now there are no specific drugs approved as an effective means for fighting COVID19.
Clinically, the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection have two phases. During
the incubation and non-severe stages, a specific innate immune response is required to eliminate
the virus and to prevent disease progression to severe stages. Later, the adaptive immune response
is activated to completely clear the remaining viruses. The average incubation period of COVID‐
19 is estimated to be between 6 and 13 days [3] – longer than the one for influenza, suggesting that
SARS-CoV-2 may have developed mechanisms to counteract the immune response, such as
delaying the type I interferon response and thus inhibiting innate immune signalling [4].
Severe COVID-19 disease manifested through fever and pneumonia, leading to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and accompanied by a cytokine release syndrome (CRS),
has been described in up to 20% of the cases [5]. The cytokine storm and the subsequent ARDS
result from the combined action of many immunoactive molecules. Interferons, interleukins, and
chemokines are the main components involved in the development of the cytokine storm [6,7].
Already the first investigated patients in China showed leucopenia, lymphopenia, and high values
of prothrombin time and D-dimer level during the severe phase. The plasma levels of IL-1B, IL1RA, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, basic FGF, GCSF (CSF3), GMCSF (CSF2), IFNγ, IP-10
(CXCL10), MCP-1 (CCL2), MIP-1A (CCL3), MIP-1B (CCL4), PDGF, TNF-α, and VEGF
concentrations were higher in both intensive-care-unit (ICU) patients and non-ICU patients than
in healthy adults [5]. Earlier studies have shown that increased serum levels of proinflammatory
cytokines (e.g., IL-1B, IL-6, IL-12, IFNγ, IP-10, and MCP-1) were associated with pulmonary
inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [8,9].
Timely control of the cytokine storm in its early stage is the key to improving the treatment
success rate and reducing the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19. Recently, a number of
specific anti-cytokine approaches have been proposed for the treatment of the CRS, based on drugs
targeting IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, and IFNγ [10]. High IL-6 levels are strongly correlated with some of
the prominent symptoms of cytokine storm, such as vascular leakage, activation of the complement
and coagulation cascades, inducing disseminated intravascular coagulation. The inhibition of the
activity of the two key cytokines, IFNγ and IL-6, can significantly reduce or even reverse the
development of the cytokine storm. One possible candidate able to bind to both cytokines is lowmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH).
Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is a pleiotropic cytokine. The mature form of human IFNγ is a noncovalent homodimer, each of the monomers consisting of 143 amino acids (aa), 62% of which are
arranged in 6 α-helices (A to F), associated with short unstructured regions and highly flexible Cterminal end (21 aa). Upon binding to its receptor, IFNγ activates the JAK/STAT1α signal
transduction pathway. STAT1 is phosphorylated, subsequently dimerises and then translocates
into the nucleus to initiate the transcription of target genes. The 3D structure of the complex of
IFNγ with its receptor, which consists of two non-covalently associated chains, IFNGR1 and
IFNGR2, is resolved and the binding sites are mapped on the IFNγ molecule [11,12]. They are

located in the loop between helices A and B (residues 18–26), His111 and a short putative area
(residues 128–131) in the flexible C-terminal domain.
Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, secreted by many cell types upon
stimulation during infection, inflammation or cancer [13]. IL-6 is important for regulating B cell
and T cell responses and for coordinating the activity of the innate and the adaptive immune
systems. IL-6 is a 26 kDa, 212 residues bundle cytokine shaped in 4 α-helical parts with two
extensive loop regions situated between helices A and B and helices C and D [14]. It binds to the
IL-6 receptor (IL-6R, also known as IL-6R subunit-α or IL-6Rα), an 80 kDa protein devoid of
signalling capacity. This complex binds to a second membrane protein, glycoprotein 130 (gp130,
also known as IL-6R subunit-ß and acting as a signalling receptor for the whole IL-6 family),
which dimerises and initiates intracellular signalling [15]. gp130 is ubiquitously expressed on the
cell surface, however IL-6R is found only on a few cell types, such as hepatocytes, some
leukocytes and epithelial cells [16]. IL-6 exhibits affinity only for IL-6R but not for gp130. The
complex IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 homodimerises to form a hexamer that is a prerequisite for the
initiation of the IL-6 intracellular signaling.
Heparin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide, a member of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG)
family. It is widely used in the medical practice as an anticoagulant, with common mild side effects
but also some more severe ones, among them the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [17]. Heparin
is a linear highly sulfated polysaccharide chain, composed of repeating disaccharide units of 1,4
linked α-L-iduronic or β-D-glucuronic acid (D-GlcA), and α-D-glucosamine (D-GlcN). The
predominant substitution pattern comprises 2-O-sulfation of the iduronate residues and N- and 6O-sulfation of the glucosamine residues [18,19]. This structure defines one of the most prominent
characteristics of the molecule – a high density negative electric charge. This is the main reason
for the high biological activity of the heparin. It binds more than 700 proteins. While natural
heparin (also known as UFH or unfractionated heparin) consists of chains of varying molecular
weight, from 5 kDa to over 40 kDa, its fractionated form, the low molecular weight heparin
(LMWH), consists of more uniformly weighted chains – at least 60% of them being below 8 kDa
of weight, and is preferred in the clinical practice because of its more predictable pharmacokinetics
and milder side effects.
In a biological context, heparin action is more closely linked to defense against exogenous
pathogens [20] and responses following tissue damage. Heparin derivatives were shown to be
capable of acting at several points in the inflammatory process [21]. Heparin alters cytokine levels
[22] and one of its biological roles may be to dampen the effects of the sudden release of large
numbers of cytokines following infection or sudden trauma.
The objective of our investigations is to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of heparin for
prevention and suppression of the development of cytokine storm in acute COVID-19 patients. In
particular, we investigate its ability to bind to IFN and IL-6 cytokines and inhibit their signaling
pathways, thus opening the door for modulation of the development of cytokine storm.
2. Materials and methods
2.1.Explicit solvent MD simulations
The MD simulations in this study were performed with the GROMACS software package [23–
25]. If not specified otherwise, the MD protocol consisted of a force field parameterization,
structure-in-vacuum energy minimization, solvation, charge neutralization through Na+ and Cl3

ions at 0.15 M concentration, energy minimization, MD run with position restraints on heavy
solute atoms (PR run) and production MD runs in the NPT ensemble. The temperature was kept
constant by applying Berendsen [26] and V-rescale [27] thermostats during PR and production
run, respectively. Berendsen barostat was used in equilibration MD runs and Parrinello-Rahman
barostat – for the production MD runs [28]. Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by
applying the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm [29] with 1.2 nm cut-off radius for short-range
interactions. Switch function was used for Van der Waals interactions calculations with 1.2 nm
cut-off radius and 1 nm switching distance. We used the leap-frog integration algorithm with 2 fs
time step, the covalent bonds connecting hydrogen atoms with the solute heavy atoms were kept
with fixed length by LINCS algorithm [30] and RATTLE algorithm [31] was used to keep the
solvent molecules rigid.
2.2. Heparin hexasaccharide structure
Based on data from literature [32–34] the following hexasaccharide sequence was chosen as a
model molecule for a general LMWH: GlcNAc(6S) (1→4) GlcA (1→4) GlcNS(6S) (1→4)
IdoA(2S) (1→4) GlcNS (1→4) GlcA(2S). This oligosaccharide chain has a net charge of -9e. The
Glycan Reader & Modeler module [35] of the CHARMM-GUI server [36] was used for generation
of a three-dimensional structure, corresponding to the chosen carbohydrate sequence, as well as a
topology using the latest version of the CHARMM36 carbohydrate force field [37]. The topology
was converted to a GROMACS-compatible topology using the parmed module of Ambertools 16
[38].
2.3. Human interferon gamma
The 3D model of reconstructed and folded full-length IFNγ [39,40] was used as the initial
structure for the IFNγ-associated simulations.
2.4. Human interleukin 6
The crystal structure of human interleukin-6 with PDB ID 1 ALU [41] was taken from [42].
The missing residues, 52SerSerLysGluAlaLeuAlaGluAsn60, were added using the loop-modeling
interface [43] to MODELLER [44] of UCSF Chimera [45]. A 10 ns production MD run was
performed to prepare the initial structure of the IL-6 molecule for all subsequent IL-6 related
studies.
2.5. IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 complex
The crystal structure of human IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 complex with PDB ID 1P9M [46] was
taken from [42]. The 3D structure for interaction analysis was prepared by a 10 ns MD simulation
as described above.
2.6. Heparin-protein complexes simulations
To study the interaction of IFNγ with LMWH, four hexasaccharides were placed near the two
C-termini of the homodimer. The minimal distance between the carbohydrates and the protein was
1.6 nm. The MOE software package was employed to prepare the initial structures of the
complexes of IL-6 and heparin, and IL-6/IL6Rα and heparin. The heparin molecules were docked
in IL-6 and IL-6/IL6Rα complex based in proximity to IL-6 binding sites I and II [46].

2.7. Complex-interactions Analysis
The evaluation of the interactions in the investigated molecular complexes was performed with
the MOE software suit. To this end, the MD-generated structures were further optimised in the
MMFF94 force field to allow for a hydrophobicity profiling of the respective SAS. The
interactions between IL-6 or IL-6/IL6Rα and the heparin molecules were analysed and visualised
with the ligand interactions functionality of MOE [47,48].
2.8. Cell culture
WISH cell line (ATCC® CCL-25™) was propagated in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium
(EMEM, ATCC® 30-2003™) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco™) and
penicillin-streptomycin (10000 U/ml, Gibco™). Cells were cultured in 25-cm2 flasks (Thermo
Scientific™ Nunc™) at 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.
2.9. Inhibitory antiproliferative assay
Confluent WISH cell monolayers were detached by trypsin-EDTA treatment (Sigma) and were
seeded in a 96 well plate (Corning®) at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were treated with: i)
100 ng/ml IFNγ purified as described in [49], ii) IFNγ (100 ng/ml) supplemented with Fraxiparine
(GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals S.A.) in concentrations varying from 1.5 to 150 anti-Xa IU/ml
pre-incubated for 1h at room temperature and iii) Fraxiparine in the same concentrations as in ii).
Further the antiproliferative activity of IFNγ was measured by a modified kynurenine bioassay as
described earlier [50].
2.10. Cellular localisation of phosphorylated STAT1
In order to determine the localisation of the phosphorylated STAT1, WISH cells were grown
on coverslips, washed twice with 1 × PBS and treated for 15 min with 100 ng/ml IFNγ alone or
IFNγ (100 ng/ml) pre-incubated for 1h at room temperature with Fraxiparine in concentrations
varying from 7.5 to 150 anti-Xa IU/ml. As a control, the cells were separately treated with the
highest concentration of Fraxiparine (150 anti-Xa IU/ml). Following the incubation, the cells were
first fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in 1 × PBS for 7 min at room temperature followed by washing
with 1 × PBS. Next, the cells were fixed with methanol for 5 min at – 20°C. After the fixation, the
cells were permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, washed with 1 × PBS and
blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in 1 × PBS).
The cells where incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701) primary
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 9167S) diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer, followed by
washing 5 times with 0.1% Tween 20 in 1 × PBS. Cells were then stained with secondary antibody
Alexa Fluor® 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG in blocking buﬀer at dilution 1:500 for 1 h at room
temperature in the dark. Following the incubation, the coverslips were washed 4 times with 0.1%
Tween 20 in 1 × PBS. The nuclei were counterstained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for
2 min at room temperature. Тhe coverslips were washed with distilled water and mounted on glass
slides with ProLong™ Gold Antifade mounting media (Invitrogen). Images were analysed by
CellProﬁler software [51].

3. Results
3.1. Effect of heparin on the activity of IFNγ
In this study the antiproliferative activity of IFNγ was used as a basis to study the effect of
LMWH. It was measured by a modiﬁed kynurenine bioassay [50] run with a referent recombinant
IFNγ having speciﬁc biological activity of 106 IU/mg [49]. Preformed monolayers of WISH cells
were treated with 100 ng/ml (100 IU/ml) IFNγ alone or pre-incubated with various concentrations

of LMWH. The antiproliferative activity of IFNγ in this assay is due to the induction of
indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which is the ﬁrst and rate limiting enzyme in the tryptophan
catabolism, catalysing oxidative cleavage of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine. Following a
hydrolysis step, the latter is transformed into kynurenine, which results with Ehrlich’s reagent in
a yellow-coloured compound absorbing at 490 nm. As seen in Fig. 1, LMWH inhibited the
antiproliferative activity of IFNγ in a concentration-dependent manner with concentration of about
35 IU/ml reducing it to 50% of the control level. The addition of LMWH at 150 IU/ml was not
toxic to the cells but abolished the induction of IDO up to 80%.
In order to further investigate the effect of LMWH on IFNγ signalling inside the stimulated
cells we studied the translocation of phosphorylated STAT1 in the nucleus using specific
antibodies. The endogenous phosphor-STAT1 (Tyr701) was visualised by immuno-fluorescence
staining of fixed WISH cells after 15 min induction with 100 ng/ml (100 IU/ml) IFNγ alone or in
the presence of various concentrations of LMWH (Fig. 2). The obtained results once again
confirmed that LMWH abolishes the IFNγ signalling, showing full inhibition of the
phosphorylation of STAT1 and therefore its translocation into the nucleus at 150 U/ml.
The obtained results indisputably show that LMWH abolishes the biological activity of IFNγ.
In order to shed light on the mechanism of action of LMWH we performed MD simulation of the
interaction of heparin hexasaccharides with the IFNγ molecule.
3.2. Simulation of heparin hexasaccharides’ interaction with IFNγ
IFNγ is a basic cytokine, with the full-length homodimer having a net charge of +18e. The
positive charge is concentrated mainly in the domains D1 (125LysThrGlyLysArgLysArg131, charge

+5e) and D2 (137ArgGlyArgArg140, charge +3e) of the C-tails. LMWH sugars are highly negatively
charged, each chain having a net charge of -9e. Expectedly, the interaction between IFNγ and the
hexasaccharides must be dominated by a very intensive electrostatic attraction.

The MD simulation of 500 ns (the initial and the final conformations shown in Fig. 3)
confirmed this expectation. The first carbohydrate attaches to the cytokine in just 1 ns. Another
nanosecond later, three of the four saccharides have formed at least one contact with the cytokine.
The number of contacts between the protein and the sugars is shown in Fig. 4. Within the next 357

40 ns, the carbohydrate chains move closer and closer to the protein molecule and form more and
more contacts, until all three sugars lie down on the protein surface and the number of contacts
curve plateaus. This is reflected by the solvent accessible surface area of the carbohydrates, shown
in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Material. The fourth LMWH chain binds to IFNγ after 204 ns. It
should be noted, that by that time the complex formed between IFNγ and the first three

hexasaccharides already has a net negative charge. As with the first three carbohydrates, after the
initial binding this fourth sugar quickly adopts a conformation, covering the cytokine surface,
which saturates the number of contacts.
The IFNγ/LMWH saccharides complexes are extremely stable. Indeed, once a few contacts
between a sugar chain and the protein are formed, the sugars do not dissociate from the complex

within the simulated time. These complexes are stabilised through a fairly high number of
hydrogen bonds. On average in the last 250ns of the simulation, dp6_1 forms 9 +/- 2 H-bonds,
dp6_2 – 10+/-2, dp6_3 – 12+/-2 and dp6_4 – 4+/-1. The hydrogen bonds between each
hexasaccharide and the IFNγ homodimer are shown in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material.
As expected, the LMWH chains interact with the positively charged parts of the IFNγ
molecule. The cytokine has three basic clusters – one in the globular part in helix E,
86
LysLysLysArg89, and two in the flexible C-terminal tail, the D1 and D2 regions described above.
These are all located in the bottom part of the IFNγ molecule. An electrostatic potential surface of
the input protein configuration, showing the surface distribution of charges, is depicted in Fig. S3
of the Supplementary Material.

Fig. 5 Contact map of the IFNγ /hexasaccharides complex. Contacts within 0.6 nm formed between each of
the four hexasaccharides and the two monomers of IFNγ. Contact occupancy within the last 250 ns of the
simulation ranges from 0 (cyan) to 1 (purple).

Fig. 5 shows a contact map of the close interactions of the four hexasaccharides and the two
IFNγ monomers. As evident on the map, the sugars bind to exactly these three domains. Dp6_1
binds to the D1 domain in the C-terminus of chain B of the cytokine. Later this C-terminus swings
and approaches the globule, which allows dp6_1 to form a few contacts with helix E of chain A.
Dp6_2 and dp6_3 both attach to the C-terminus of chain A. Dp6_2 interacts with both the D1 and
D2 domains. Dp6_3 binds on the other side of the D1 domain, which places it in close proximity
to helix A in chain B, where it forms contacts with the positively charged N-terminal NH3 group
of Gln1, Asp2, Lys6 and Lys12-Lys13. The fourth hexasaccharide, dp6_4 binds to the basic cluster
in helix E of chain B. As it attaches to the surface of the IFNγ globule, it also forms some loose
contacts with the sequence Lys34AsnTrpLys38 at the end of helix B in chain A.
Our simulation shows that LMWH binds to the C-termini of IFNγ with high affinity, forming
very stable complexes due to the strong electrostatic attraction. After binding of two or more
LMWH hexasaccharides the complex changes its net charge from positive to negative. This
impedes further interaction of the cytokine with the extracellular part of the IFNGR1 (also
negatively charged) which is the first necessary step in the IFNγ transduction pathway. The in
silico simulation data explains the obtained experimental results. These findings put forward
heparin as an effective inhibitor of IFNγ and, as such, a good candidate for influencing the
development of the cytokine storm.

3.3. LMWH binding to the IL-6 and IL-6/IL-6Rα complex
As a prerequisite for the dynamics studies, all binding sites in the triple complex IL-6/IL6Rα/gp130 were scrutinised. The complex structure prepared as described in Sec. 2.6 is shown in

A 250 ns simulation of IL-6/LMWH complex was performed with the initial conformation
chosen with account for the identified binding sites, specifically targeting the positively charged
amino acid residues of IL-6, involved in purely polar interactions between IL-6 and IL-6Rα (Fig.
7a). A stable conformation was achieved, with heparin binding at Leu19 and Arg30 from helix A
and Lys171, Arg179 and Arg182 belonging to helix D. All these interactions are electrostatic in
nature, determined by the strong attraction between the positively charged residues of IL-6 and the
negatively charged heparin (Fig. 7b). In particular, in this interaction the key residues from site I
Arg30, Arg179 and Arg182 are engaged. Actually the heparin molecule is bound at IL-6 helix A
and helix D, blocking the IL-6 binding sites to the IL-6Rα thus inhibiting the IL-6 interaction with
its receptor.

In studying the possibility of heparin hindering through its binding to the IL-6/IL-6R complex
the subsequent binding of the latter to gp130, two putative positions were identified. In the first
one, heparin is strongly bound to residues Lys40, Lys41, and Arg168 of IL-6, which are not among
the direct participants in the complex formation. Thus, heparin impact analysis in this
conformation requires full-complex large-scale simulations. In the second position heparin binds
to Arg30 of IL-6 helix A and Lys252 of IL-6Rand comes in close proximity to Tyr31 of IL-6
helix A This position is of particular interest because, based on mutation studies [53], Tyr31 is
considered to be of key importance in the biological activity of IL-6. However, a 250 ns simulation
revealed this position as less stable. Its stabilization was achieved by adding two Mg2+ ions in
another 250 ns simulation, the final conformation of which is depicted in Fig. 8 (left panel). This
result is not surprising, taking into consideration the findings about the Ca2+-dependent action of
heparin outside of the anticoagulant context (see, e.g., [32]). With the gp130 receptor
superimposed onto the simulated system (Fig. 8, right panel), we realise the significant impact
potential of LMWH on the formation of the IL-6/IL-6R/gp130 complex. Not only does heparin
bind to Arg30, the immediate neighbour of the key residue Tyr31, but it is also positioned in front
of helices A and C of IL-6, thus covering the Tyr31-part of IL-6 binding site II and preventing
helix C of IL-6 from getting close enough to gp130 to form a complex. As a consequence, IL-6
and its two receptor parts fail to form a biologically active complex, meaning that the involvement
of LMWH interrupts the IL-6 signalling pathway.

4. Discussion
The severe phase of COVID-19 is characterised by a high level of expression of interferonstimulated genes with proinflammatory activities, showing the immunopathological role of IFNγ
response [4]. Among the elevated cytokines, IFNγ and the IFNγ-stimulated chemokines (such as
IP-10 (CXCL10), MCP-1 (CCL2), and MIG) are especially prominent already in the very early
fever days. The over-production of pro-inflammatory IFNγ and chemokines might be resulting
from the lack of IL-10 – mediated down-regulation of the immune responses to SARS-CoV
infection [54]. The elevated levels of IFNγ may also be related to lymphopenia since IFNγ was
reported to induce apoptosis of activated T cells [55].

IFNγ can induce both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. This allows it to tailor the immune
response either for defense against infection or towards maintaining the homeostasis of the host
[56]. When overexpressed, IFNγ is a key factor in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases,
inflammation, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer [56–58]. Besides CRS, the
treatment of such diseases may also benefit from the inhibition of IFNγ signal transduction.
In fact, it is known that IFNγ binds with high affinity to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), in
particular heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin [59–61]. These interactions affect the activity, physicochemical properties and proteolytic processing of the C-terminal domain of the cytokine. However,
thus far the use of heparin as an effective IFNγ inhibitor directly preventing IFNγ from binding to
its extracellular receptor was given little to no attention.
Our experimental and computational investigations show that LMWH binds with high affinity
to IFNγ and at a certain concentration is able to inhibit fully the interaction with its cellular
receptor, thus blocking the IFNγ signalling pathway and the expression of the IFNγ induced
proteins. This observation reveals heparin as a potent candidate for regulation of the IFNγ
overexpression. In particular, it can be helpful in the therapy of autoimmune diseases, acute
inflammatory processes, and cytokine release syndrome.
IL-6 signalling is achieved via two different mechanisms. The first one, the cis-signalling,
requires binding of IL-6 to its membrane-bound IL-6 receptor. This complex subsequently recruits
two molecules of membrane-bound gp130, a process that leads to downstream signalling via
JAK1/STAT3 pathway kinases (which is very similar to the interferon signalling pathway) [62].
The second mechanism, the trans-signalling, depends on the binding of IL-6 to the soluble IL-6
receptor (sIL-6R), which is expressed via mRNA splicing or proteolysis [61]. The formation of
IL-6/sIL-6R complex activates gp130 on the cells that do not express the membrane-bound IL-6
receptor [63]. The trans-signalling is responsible for most of IL-6 inﬂammation-inducing
capabilities (including the cytokine storm), whereas the anti-inﬂammatory activities of the
cytokine are mediated via the cis-signalling [64].
Levels of IL-6 are very low under normal conditions, but they can raise many thousand-fold
in inﬂammatory states. This is the reason for IL-6 being used, similar to the C-reactive protein
(CRP), as a biomarker for the inﬂammation levels in patients with cancer, infection, autoimmune
diseases or COVID-19 [65,66].
Inhibition of the IL-6/gp130/STAT3 pathway is considered to have therapeutic potential in
cancer, autoimmune diseases, infection and COVID-19 [67,68]. At present, an antibody that blocks
site I – siltuximab, has been approved as a drug. Two other antibodies are in different trial phases.
Neutralising antibodies that block IL-6 receptors outside of the cell or small chemicals that target
the involved kinases and transcription factors within the cell have been developed, some are
approved as biologics (such as tocilizumab) and others are in different trial stages. However, the
major concern for their use is in side effects, increased risk of bacterial and viral infections or their
lack of specificity [69].
One feasible alternative for blocking the binding of IL-6 to its receptors is the application of
LMWH. Our simulations show that IL-6 interacts with heparin forming a stable complex. The
heparin molecule blocks the binding site I of IL-6 and prevents helices A and D from getting in
close contact with IL-6R. Thus heparin inhibits formation of the IL-6/IL-6R complex and
breaks the IL-6 signaling path. The other way in which heparin influences the biological activity
of IL-6 is through binding to the complex IL-6/IL-6R blocking the binding site II of IL-6 and
preventing helices A and C to be in a proper position to bind to gp130 receptor. These findings
explain experimental observations [67] on heparin binding properties of IL-6. All together brings

us to the conclusion that LMWH is a strong candidate for IL-6 activity inhibitor especially in the
context of trans-signalling mechanism.
GAGs are universally present on cell surfaces and might be expected to serve as a broad
spectrum and relatively non-specific receptors for virus binding [70]. Heparin as a potential
inhibitor of viral attachment has been demonstrated for DENV [71]. Recently, viral attachment to
GAGs was reported for IFNα/βBP from variola (smallpox virus), monkeypox viruses [72],
hepatitis B [73], and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [74]. Heparin and its derivatives have been
shown to be effective in preventing the infection of cells by the influenza virus, strain H5N1 [75],
and to have effects on ZIKV-induced cell death that are independent of adhesion and invasion
[76]. Recently it was shown that heparin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding
domain and induces conformational changes in it. As a result, heparin inhibits virus invasion by
70% [77].
GAGs and heparin in particular have been suggested as playing a protective role in the
inflammation response [78], which has been interpreted as involving (among other things) the
inhibition of elastase and the interaction with several cytokines [21]. Heparin and its analogues
have been proposed for the application to elastase inhibition for cystic fibrosis treatment (or other
conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Many of the applications of
heparin may stem, at least in part, from the ability of heparin to moderate inflammation (see
[19,79]). In general, heparin is perceived as acting via several routes, among them interaction with
cytokines [80].
In the case of COVID-19 the heparin is used as an anticoagulant drug following the observation
that patients in acute stage develop diffuse alveolar damage with extensive pulmonary coagulation
activation resulting in fibrin deposition in the microvasculature and formation of hyaline
membranes in the air sacs [81]. A wide multi-centre international trial on treatment with nebulised
heparin of patients with COVID-19 was initiated [82]. COVID-19 patient autopsies have revealed
thrombi in the microvasculature, suggesting intravascular coagulation as a prominent feature of
organ failure in these patients. Elevated D-dimer levels were identified as a clear indicator for
severity and mortality. Reduction of the hospital stay, decrease of severity and reduction of the
mortality was registered in patients treated with heparin [83]. In another study with 449 patients
involved and 99 out of them treated mainly with LMWH, the D-dimer and prothrombin time were
positively and the platelet counts were negatively correlated with mortality. A reduced mortality
in severe patients treated with heparin was reported in [84]. A similar response – reduced severity
and mortality – was observed also in hemodialysis patients who were treated with heparin or other
anticoagulants according to the standard protocols [85].
The dynamic changes of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines profiles of patients with COVID19 and their correlations were studied in [86]. The severe cases showed a significant sustainable
decrease in lymphocyte counts and an increase in neutrophil one compared to the respective levels
in mild cases. In particular, decrease in the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and increase of IL2, IL-6, IL-10 and IFNγ were registered. Similar results were reported in [87] indicating an overall
decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells in severe patients.
The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was increased in mild patients. A remarkable
up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 was registered in severe patients.
It was shown that the comprehensive reduction of the lymphocyte levels, and the elevation of IL2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19. In a retrospective clinical study [88] it was
reported that LMWH not only improves the coagulation dysfunction of COVID-19 patients but
also significantly reduces the levels of IL-6 and increases levels of the lymphocytes.

In summary, the clinical studies show a significant increase of the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10,
and hINFγ at the beginning of the acute phase of the disease. At the same time, a reduction of the
levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and B-cells is observed. After patient treatment with LMWH, a
fast reduction of the inflammatory cytokines, restoration of the levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells
and B-cells, reduction of the levels of virions and significantly faster recovery was observed.
Combined with the clinical studies, our results suggest that heparin, in particular LMWH, is a very
promising candidate for a therapeutic means for prevention and inhibition of the cytokine storm in
COVID-19 patients.
5. Conclusions
There is a considerable volume of observational data regarding the use of heparin in the
treatment of COVID-19. The reason for including this drug in the treatment protocols is to reduce
the formation of blood clots that prevents a number of complications (heart attacks, emboli,
strokes, etc.), but also obstruction of the capillaries in the alveoli.
The main result of our study is that heparin is, in fact, a potent anti-inflammatory agent that
can be used in acute inflammatory conditions, due to its ability to block at least two (IFN and IL6) of the key signaling molecules involved in the process of the inflammation development. Thus,
it should be prescribed in the initial stages of an acute condition (pneumonia). The decision to start
application of LMWH in COVID-19 patients and its dosage should be based on careful follow up
during the treatment course of the levels of D-dimer, prothrombin time, platelet counts, IL-2, IL6, IL-10, IFN, IP-10 (CXCL10), MCP-1 (CCL2), MIG, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and B-cells.
Elevation of D-dimer, IL-2, IL-6, IFN (or IP-10) levels, along with a reduction of CD4+ and
CD8+ T-cells and B-cells counts is a clear signal for the approaching onset of the acute phase of
the disease and an indication for the inclusion of LMWH in the treatment plan. The doses still need
to be elaborated but our results suggest an orientation towards the upper limit of the dosage scale,
whereby the action of heparin will be threefold – anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral.
The action of heparin as an anti-inflammatory agent does not depend on the virus type and, in
general, the cause for the acute inflammatory process. This broadens its application range even
more – for treatment of viral infections leading to acute inflammatory conditions characterised by
increased cytokine levels, in particular those of IL-6 and IFNγ.
Heparin is a well-known and widely used medication and its side effects are studied in detail.
This greatly facilitates the expansion of its scope towards the treatment of acute inflammatory
conditions, in particular those associated with COVID-19; the general limitations for LMWH use
remain valid in these cases as well.
Overexpression of IFNγ is also observed in a number of autoimmune diseases. A possible
treatment strategy consists in inhibiting the biological activity of IFNγ. The results of our study
reveal the capability of heparin to influence the development of such autoimmune diseases.
Our findings about the potential of heparin as an anti-inflammatory agent need validation
through appropriate clinical trials. In view of the current situation with the COVID-19 pandemic
and the extensive use of heparin in the clinical practice as anticoagulant drug, we strongly suggest
the wide application of heparin for COVID-19 treatment as a potent anti-inflammatory ligand in
the framework of carefully monitored and controlled clinical trials.
