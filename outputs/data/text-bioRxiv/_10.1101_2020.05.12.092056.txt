Abstract

24

During the COVID-19 pandemic, precisely tracing the route of the SARS-CoV-2

25

transmission in human population remains challenging. Because this RNA virus can

26

mutate massively without a specifically tracing maker. Herein, using a geographic

27

stratified genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2599 full-genome sequences, we

28

identified that two SNPs (i.e., 1059.C>T and 25563.G>T) of linkage disequilibrium were

29

presented in approximately half of North America SARS-CoV-2 population (p = 2.44 x

30

10-212 and p = 2.98 x 10-261), resulting two missense mutations (i.e., Thr 265 Ile and Gln 57

31

His) in ORF1ab and ORF3a, respectively. Interestingly, these two SNPs exclusively

32

occurred in the North America dominated clade 1, accumulated during mid to late March,

33

2020. We did not find any of these two SNPs by retrospectively tracing the two SNPs in

34

bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV-2 from the first epicenter

35

Wuhan or other regions of China mainland. This suggested that the SARS-CoV-2

36

population of Chinese mainland were different from the prevalent strains of North America.

37

Time-dependently, we found that these two SNPs first occurred in Europe SARS-CoV-2

38

(26-Feb-2020) which was 3 days early than the occurring date of North America isolates

39

and 17 days early for Asia isolates (Taiwan China dominated). Collectively, this population

40

genetic analysis highlights a well-confidential transmission route of the North America

41

isolates and the two SNPs we newly identified are possibly novel diagnosable or

42

druggable targets for surveillance and treatment.

44

Since human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome

45

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causative agent of COVID-19, was confirmed on

46

14-Jan-2020(1). At 11-Mar-2020, the world health organization (WHO) had officially

47

started to alarm the human COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, over 4 million of human cases

48

have been confirmed globally, in which the most cases were from North America and

49

Europe. Thus, it is very urgent to precisely trace its transmission route that possibly helps

50

public health surveillance (2). However, such a specific surveillance marker is infeasible.

51

Because the SARS-CoV-2 mutates massively without a faithful identity to trace that

52

hampers the precise tracing of its transmission route(3, 4). Due to the advancement of

53

genome-wide association study (GWAS) to address the complexity of population genetics,

54

a geographic stratified GWAS study was performed using 2599 full-genome sequences of

55

global SARS-CoV-2 population(5). We primarily found that two SNPs (i.e., 1059.C>T and

56

25563.G>T) of complete linkage disequilibrium were presented in approximately half of

57

the North America SARS-CoV-2 strains. Using the two SNPs for a retrospective tracing

58

study, a well-confidential transmission route of the North America isolates was confirmed.

59

The two SNPs we newly identified are possibly novel diagnosable or druggable targets for

60

surveillance and treatment.

61
62

Phylogenetic tree of global SARS-CoV-2.

63

To identify the phylogeographic relationship of global SARS-CoV-2 population

64

(n=2599), a total of 13 clades was confirmed though strain mixture of geographic

65

distribution exists to some extent that was probably caused by international travel. We

66

found that the North America isolates dominated the clade1 (418/521, 80.23%) and three

67

small clades including clade 2, 3 and 7(Fig. 1), in which the clade 7 was also evolutionally

68

closed to the bat (RaTG13) and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2. Besides, the clade 4, 5, 6

69

and clade 13 were dominated by Europe isolates and clade 9, clade 11 and clade 12 were

70

dominated by Asia isolates (Fig. 1). Importantly, the phylogenetic tree is inferred by the

71

massively producing mutations, identification of key mutations can possibly provide clues

72

for tracing the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 (6).

74

Geographic GWAS study reveals two SNPs of linkage disequilibrium associating

75

the North America SARS-CoV-2 population

76

Calling key SNPs from the massive mutations apparently requires a GWAS study that

77

has been learned from human GWAS study (also refer to microbial GWAS) (5). Because

78

of the mixture of the phylogenetic tree, thus it may be unconfident to perform a

79

phylogenetic stratified GWAS study. This alternatively promoted a geographic stratified

80

GWAS study as the geographic location of individual strain is confident though

81

international travel exists. The mutation features between continents may possibly reflect

82

the incidence of viral mutation emergence in different human hosts(6). Using the

83

geographic stratified GWAS study comparing the North America isolates and the outside

84

isolates, we founded that 21 out of 5312 SNPs or INDELs were significantly associated

85

using the Wuhan isolate (GASID: EPI_ISL_402125) as reference genome for SNP calling

86

(Threshold p-value = 1.00 x 10-15) (Fig 2A). Specifically, the top two SNPs (i.e., 1059.C>T

87

and 25563.G>T) are significantly presented in approximately half of the North America

88

SARS-CoV-2 population (p-value =2.44 x10-212 and p=2.98 x10-261) and all occur in the

89

clade 1 of North America SARS-CoV-2 population (Table 1). Interestingly, the two SNPs

90

are perfect linkage disequilibrium, suggesting the two SNPs concurrently occur in the

91

North America dominating SARS-CoV-2 population (Fig 2B). Functional analysis indicted

92

that the two SNPs resulted two missense mutations (i.e., Thr 265 Ile and Gln 57 His) in

93

ORF1ab and ORF3a, respectively. Among these 21 SNPs, we also identified the

94

previously reported 8782.C>T and 28144.T>C SNPs that was consistent to our analysis

95

but had a comparatively low significance (p-value = 4.03 x10-28 and 9.73 x10-33), resulting

96

a synonymous mutation and a missense mutation (Leu 84 Ser) (3) (Table 1).

97
98

Retrospective tracing study reveals a well-confidential transmission route of the

99

North American SARS-CoV-2 population

100

In the North America SARS-CoV-2 population, 54% strains have these two SNPs and

101

in particular 100% for the clade 1 (Table 1). Because of the high occurrence of the two

102

SNPs, tracing the two SNPs may provide a well-confidential transmission route of the

103

SARS-CoV-2 in major North America human population. We thus did a retrospective

104

tracing study in our high confidential database (2599 flittered strains) to identify the time

105

sequential of occurring the two SNPs among continents. We found that the first occurring

106

incidence started in France, Europe (26-Feb-2020) which was 3 days early than the

107

occurring date of the North America isolates (29-Feb-2020) and 17 days early for the Asia

108

isolates (Taiwan but not Chinese mainland) (13-Mar-20202, Taiwan, China) (Fig 3) (Table

109

2) (Fig 3A-G). Further tracing the accumulating frequencies per day of the two SNPs

110

among continents, we found that during mid to late March, the North America isolates

111

highly accumulated such two SNPs. Besides, the mean number of all accumulating SNPs

112

before or after mid to late March were significantly lower than that during the same period

113

(Sup Fig S1). These evidences indicated that the two SNPs were strongly selected in

114

North America SARS-CoV-2 population during mid to late March. The accumulation of the

115

two SNPs may possibly explain the sharp increase of confirmed cases in the North

116

America before early April (data not shown). Because the viruses acquired such two

117

strong selected sites at the same period that may enhance it spread in the North America

118

human population.

119

Because the SARS-CoV-2 was believably transmitted from wildlife to human before

120

happening of human-to human transmission (7, 8) (3). We then carefully scrutinized if bat

121

or pangolin coronaviruses had the two mutations before they jumped to human species.

122

But, we did not find any of these two SNPs in the bat or pangolin related coronaviruses

123

because they were highly skeptical for human COVID-19 pandemic ascribing to high

124

sequence similarity (Sup Fig S2). Alternatively, in the bat or pangolin coronaviruses, the

125

1059 site has no or a C>A mutation and the 25563 site has a G>A mutation instead (Sup

126

Fig S2). These evidences indicated that the bat and pangolin coronaviruses might

127

undergo a strong selection after jumping to human population at least in the major North

128

America human population.

129
130

CONCLUSION REMARK

131

Using the two SNPs identified by the geographic stratified GWAS study, we have now

132

reconstructed the well-confidential transmission route of North America SARS-CoV-2

133

population, that the first transmission incidence with the two SNPs happened at Europe

134

(26-Feb-2020), the North America (29-Feb-2020), then South American (10-Mar-2020),

135

and later Asia (13-Mar-2020) and Oceania(14-Mar-2020). Regardless of the importance of

136

the transmission route, the two SNPs also pose great possibility for epidemic surveillance

137

in North America human population as its high prevalence in the same population. To

138

precisely tracing of the COVID-19 pandemic, development of a differential diagnosis is

139

urgently needed, such as the two SNPs based real-time reverse transcription polymerase

140

chain reaction (PCR) method (9).

141

Moreover, the two SNPs are responsible for two missense mutations. The missense

142

mutations may change the protein function to some extent through we do not provide the

143

evidences but it is generally believed. More mechanical investigations of the functional

144

impact caused by these two SNPs would be enhanced in this aspect as the they are

145

possibly druggable targets. In the future, it is hoped, by detecting to the two SNPs

146

harboring SARS-CoV-2 we estimated, this would help public health surveillance and

147

investigation of their functional impacts would promote novel drug development.

Materials and methods

150

2.1. Data acquisition

151

In this study, whole-genome sequences of global SARS-CoV-2 collected from

152

12-Dec-2019 to 24-Apr-2020 (8:00 GMT + 8) were archived from the database of GISAID

153

Initiative EpiCoV platform (GISAID; https://www.epicov.org). A total 8480 sequences were

154

archived and primarily filtered by the criteria, such as high coverage only (> 29,000 bp),

155

exclusion of low coverage and the sequence with unknown bases (N) inside. The

156

identically redundant sequences was further removed by CD-HIT software (version 4.8.1,

157

parameters: -aL 1 -aS 1 -c 1 -s 1) (10). A final 2599 sequences with high confidence were

158

used in this study (Table S1).

159
160

2.2. Phylogenetic analysis

161

The 2599 full-genome sequences were aligned by MAFFT software (version 7.407,

162

parameter: --auto)(11). The phylogenetic tree of the globally 2599 SARS-CoV-2 was

163

constructed by FastTreeMP software (version 2.1.3, parameter: -nt -gtr -gamma) using

164

approximately maximum likelihood (ML) method. A total 13 clades were identified and the

165

geographic distribution of each clade were displayed by a pie chart.

166
167
168

2.3 SNP calling
The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertion-deletion (INDELs)

169

polymorphisms were detected by MUMmer software (version 3.0, nucmer, show-snps) (12)

170

using the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (GISAID: EPI_ISL_402125, Genbank: NC_045512.2) as a

171

reference genome. To validate identity of the above polymorphisms, raw reads (40 out of

172

2599 strains, NCBI SRA database) were analyzed by bwa (version 0.7.16a) (13) and

173

mpileup program of samtools software (version 1.10 )(14). The validation was consistently

174

to the polymorphisms detected by the MUMmer software (data not shown).

175
176

2.4 Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Linkage disequilibrium(LD)

177

analysis

178

In order to identify causative SNPs in population of North America SARS-CoV-2

179

(cases=1063, controls=1536), a geographic stratified genome-wide association study

180

against 5312 mutations was performed using PLINK software (version 1.90) (15). The

181

empirical threshold of p-value was suggested to be 9.41 x10-6 (0.05/5312=9.41 x10-6)

182

calculated by Benjamini & Hochberg method (1995) (16), but we further increased the

183

threshold of p-value to 1.00 x10-15 for detection of the most causative SNPs. Consequently,

184

21 significant SNPs were detected (Table 1) and the LD of paring SNPs were estimated

185

and visualized by Haploview software (version 4.1) (17).

186
187

2.5 SNPs accumulating analysis

188

To analyze the trend of SNPs accumulation during March, 2020, the frequencies of

189

average SNPs accumulation per day was counted. The same counting of the two SNPs

190

(i.e., 1059.C>T and 25563.G>T) in North America SARS-CoV-2 and the other continents

191

were traced by the date of occurring the two SNPs. These analyses were performed by

192

Microsoft® Excel 2016 (Table S2).

194

2.6 Statistics

195

Data from 2.5 were plotted by Graphpad (Version 8.2.1 for Windows, San Diego, CA).

196

The mean differences of the average SNPs accumulation per day during continuous

197

ten-days were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test (R version 3.6.2). A p-value less than

198

0.05 is considered as statistically significant.

Figure 3 Retrospectively tracing the two SNPs of SARS-CoV-2 between all

278

continents and the North America.

(A) The time-dependent accumulating plot for frequencies of the two SNPs between

280

continents. The continents are labeled by different colors and the date of first occurrence

281

of the two SNPs are also indicated. (B-G) The time-dependent accumulating plot (1059.

282

C>T & 25563. G>T) in either all continents’ SARS-CoV-2 or the North America isolates.

283

Panel B-C for occurrence of the two SNPs; panel D-E for SNP (1059. C>T) and panel F-G

284

for SNP (25563. G>T). Of note, the two SNPs largely accumulated during mid to late

285

march and the most for North America SARS-CoV-2.

Sup Figure S1 SNPs accumulation during mid to late March, 2020.

288

The mean differences of the average SNPs accumulation per day during continuous

289

ten-days were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value less than 0.05 is considered

290

as statistically significant.

Sup Figure S2 SNP calling in bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 at 1059 and

294

25563 sites.

295

Sequence alignment between bat and pangolin related SARS-CoV-2 was displayed.

296

Human Wuhan-hu-1 strain was used as reference genome. Strains from bat and pangolin

297

were named with its host name. Differently, at 1059 site, there is only one SNP for

298

pangolin P1E strain (C>A) but not C>T. And the 25563 site has another type of SNP (G>A)

299

instead of G>T.
