Summary
Genomic surveillance has become a useful tool for better understanding virus
pathogenicity, origin and spread. Obtaining accurately assembled, complete viral genomes
directly from clinical samples is still a challenging. Here, we describe three protocols using a
unique primer set designed to recover long reads of SARS-CoV-2 directly from total RNA
extracted from clinical samples. This protocol is useful, accessible and adaptable to
laboratories with varying resources and access to distinct sequencing methods: Nanopore,
Illumina and/or Sanger.

The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
belonging to the family of Coronaviridae and to the genus Betacoronaviridae, emerged in
Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has already been introduced in 185 countries to date (1,
2). In UK it has caused more than 166,443 reported cases and 26,097 death and in Brazil 80,246
cases and 5,541 deaths have already been reported, last update April 30th, 2020 (2). On March
11th, the WHO declared a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, reinforcing the need for all countries to
implement measures for rapid detection and characterization of the virus to help mitigate virus
transmission.
Genomic surveillance has become a useful tool for better understanding virus
pathogenicity, origin and spread. Obtaining accurately assembled, complete viral genomes
directly from clinical samples is still a challenging task due to the low amount of viral nucleic
acid in the clinical specimen compared to host DNA, and to the size of SARS-CoV-2 genome,
which is around 30 kb in length. Despite those limitations, we developed a sequencing protocol
that successfully obtained whole genomes from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples referred to the
National Reference laboratory at FIOCRUZ in Brazil. This protocol was further optimised for
higher throughput sequencing at University College London Pathogen Genomics Unit and
UCL Genomics to sequence genomes for the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COGUK).
The tiling amplicon multiplex PCR method has been previously used for virus
sequencing directly from clinical samples to obtain consensus genome sequences (3). This
protocol has been applied to Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 sequencing (3-6)
using preferentially short amplicons (~ 450 base pairs). Nanopore sequencing allows rapid
turnaround times (1–2 days) for obtaining a consensus sequence directly from clinical samples
and a allows faster response during an outbreak. In this study, we adapted this protocol to
recover longer 2 kb reads, decreasing the number of primers required and thus reducing
possible mismatches and/or undesired interactions. Additionally, it is easier to assemble larger
viral genomes from longer reads enabling higher depth coverage (more than 100 x) in a reduced
sequencing time.
Here, we describe three protocols using a primer set designed to sequence SARS-CoV2 directly from total RNA extracted from clinical samples, which were initially diagnosed using
real-time RT-PCR (7, 8). The protocols described herein can be applied to different sequencing
platforms, such as Sanger, Illumina and Oxford Nanopore, and therefore are useful, accessible
and adaptable to laboratories with different resources and sequencing facilities. By using this
protocol, we generated 18 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (15 from clinical samples and 3 isolates from

supernatant of Vero E6 cells culture 72 hours post infection) recovered from different Brazilian
states and 22 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from screening healthcare workers in London, UK. The
Brazilian genomes are available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) platform.

Primer design
A set of 17 primer pairs (Supplementary Table 1) was designed to cover approximately
30

kb

of

the

SARS-CoV-2

genome

using

the

online

tool

primal

scheme

(http://primal.zibraproject.org/) and Prime3 integrated tool in Geneious R9 software, based on
the alignment of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in GISAID from the beginning of
the outbreak. Each primer pair covers approximately 2 kb of the genome with a 100 bp overlap
of amplicons (primer scheme in Table 1).

Primer validation and Sanger sequencing
The primers were tested in silico using the Geneious R9 software against the 19
available SARS-CoV-2 genomes at that moment. To test the efficiency of each primer pair (10
uM) we performed conventional Sanger sequencing with two positive samples detected in
Brazil. cDNA was produced using the SuperScript™ IV First-Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen) and the DNA was amplified by Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB),
according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The 17 amplified 2 kb long products were
visualized using 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1) and each amplicon was sequenced
using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermofisher, Foster City, USA)
and 3.2 µM of the corresponding sequencing primer, indicated in Supplementary table 1. The
final reads were recovered by ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) and the
sequences were assembled using the Sequencher 5.1 software (Gene Codes).

Genome amplification for Nanopore and Illumina sequencing
Reverse transcription was initially performed using SuperScript™ IV First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen), using total RNA from samples presenting Ct values ≤30 for
gene E (7, 9). Two multiplexed PCR products (Pool A = 9 primers pairs and Pool B = 8 primers
pairs) were generated using the Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and the primer
scheme described in Table 1. The PCR products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP
beads (Beckman Coulter™) and the DNA concentration measured by the Qubit 4 Fluorometer

(Invitrogen) using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). DNA products (Multiplex
PCR pools A and B) were normalised and pooled together in a final concentration of 50 fmol.

Library construction for Nanopore sequencing
The Nanopore library protocol is straightforward as this method is optimised for long
reads, such as the generated 2 kb amplicons. Library preparation was conducted using Ligation
Sequencing 1D (SQK-LSK109 Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Native Barcoding
kit 1 to 24 (ONT), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After end repair using the
NEBNext® Ultra™ II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module (New England Biolabs, NEB) the native
barcodes were attached using a NEBNext® Ultra™ II Ligation Module (NEB). Up to 24
samples were pooled for sequencing in one flow cell. Samples were run in duplicate and two
negative controls were used in each round, for experimental validation. A MinION/GridION
run using the FLOMIN106 flow cell R9.4.1 was performed comprising 1 to 23 positive samples
and 1 negative control (present in all steps post RNA extraction). Sequencing was performed
for 2 to 24 hours using the high accuracy base calling in the MinKNOW software. High
accuracy base calling was carried out after sequencing from the fast5 files using the Oxford
Nanopore Guppy tool. The run was monitored by RAMPART (https://github.com/articnetwork/rampart) so it could be stopped when ≥ 20x depth for all amplicons was achieved
(Figure 2).

Library construction for Illumina sequencing
As Illumina sequencing chemistry is geared towards sequencing short reads, DNA
libraries were generated from the pooled amplicons using Nextera XT DNA Sample
Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer specifications.
The size distribution of the libraries was evaluated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa
Clara, USA) and the samples were pair-end sequenced (2 x 300bp) on a MiSeq v3600 cycle
(Illumina, San Diego, USA).

Data analysis
Different data analysis pipelines for Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing were
used to extract the consensus files from the raw data.
Demultiplexed Fastq files generated from the Illumina sequencing data were used as an
input for the analysis. Reads were trimmed based on quality scores with a cutoff of q30 used
to remove low quality regions and adapter sequences were removed. The reads were mapped

to Wuhan Strain MN908947, duplicate reads were removed from the alignment and the
consensus sequence called at a threshold of 10X. The entire workflow was carried out in CLC
Genomics Workbench software version 20.0.
For the Oxford Nanopore sequencing data, the high accuracy base called fastq files
were used as an input for analysis. The pipeline used was an adaptation of the artic-ncov2019
medaka workflow (https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html). We
used an earlier version of the workflow which used Porechop to demultiplex the reads. The
mapping to the Wuhan reference sequence (MN908947) was done using Minimap2 with
Medaka used for error correction. This was all carried out within the artic-ncov2019-medaka
conda environment (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019).

Genomic analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction
To put the genomes from Brazil and UK generated using this protocol in a global
context, SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other countries were recovered from GISAID. Any
sequences of length less than 29000 nucleotides, having quality issues on GISAID, or where
we detected an unusual frameshifting deletion or insertion relative to the SARS-CoV-2
reference sequence were not included in the phylogenetic reconstruction. To identify similar
genomes to the genomes produced and not available yet in GISAID we used the CoV-GLUE
website (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home), and we used the NextStrain website
(https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global), in order to observe the topology of genomes already
available in GISAID.
The final curated dataset consisting of 122 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences was
aligned using MAFFT (10). Model testing was carried out using jModelTest (11) and the
Generalized Time Reversible plus gamma model was identified as best fitting the dataset. A
Maximum Likelihood tree (Figure 3) was generated using RaXML (12) with 1000 bootstraps
as branch support. Only values greater than 70 were shown on the tree. The tree was visualized
and edited using FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
The genomes recovered using the protocol belongs to seven SARS-CoV-2 lineages
(A.2 =1, B.1 = 31, B.1.11 = 2, B.1.2 = 2, B.2.2 = 1, B.3 = 2 and B.6 = 1), according to a
classification system previously proposed (http://virological.org/t/a-dynamic-nomenclaturefor-sars-cov-2-to-assist-genomic-epidemiology/458). To subtype the strains by lineage we
used the Pangolin version 1 subtyping tool (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin).

Conclusion
Here we introduce a versatile sequencing protocol to recover the complete SARS-CoV2 genome based on reverse transcription plus an overlapping long amplicon multiplex PCR
strategy, and associated with pipelines to report the data, and recover the consensus files. The
protocol was validated with RNA extracted from some of the first COVID-19 cases detected
in Brazil and then optimized and developed for automation at two sequencing facilities at UCL
(PGU and UCL Genomics) in London UK. Alternative protocols for Illumina platform, based
on an initial amplification of larger fragments (8kb and 10.5kb) produced by one-step RT-PCR
with high fidelity enzyme blends were also tested. However, they were prone to producing
false mutations, likely due errors during amplification. Based on the fact that SARS-CoV-2
remains conserved, presenting few mutations scattered throughout the genome, the possibility
of artificial mutations must be ruled out. We have demonstrated that this overlapping long
amplicon multiplex PCR protocol suitable for samples with a wide range of viral loads,
generating high coverage throughout the viral genome without artificial indels. It worked well
on all four platforms tested (MinION, GridION, Illumina and Sanger) making it suitable for
labs with distinct expertise, enabling successful rapid sequencing recovery of the SARS-CoV2 genome directly from clinical samples.

Ethical statement
The sequencing workflow optimizations were conducted with the purpose of protocol
development and the samples used for this optimization were collected as part of the National
Brazilian Surveillance and COG-UK London. We did not use any clinical information or any
patient data in this study.
