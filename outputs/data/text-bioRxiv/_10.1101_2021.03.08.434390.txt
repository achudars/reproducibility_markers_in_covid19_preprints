Summary

35

Although a variety of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses have been identified, the

36

evolutionary origins of this virus remain elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic

37

study of 411 samples collected from 23 bat species in a small (~1100 hectare) region

38

in Yunnan province, China, from May 2019 to November 2020. We identified

39

coronavirus contigs in 40 of 100 sequencing libraries, including seven representing

40

SARS-CoV-2-like contigs. From these data we obtained 24 full-length coronavirus

41

genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2 related and three SARS-CoV related

42

genomes. Of these viruses, RpYN06 exhibited 94.5% sequence identity to SARS-

43

CoV-2 across the whole genome and was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in the

44

ORF1ab, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10 genes. The other three SARS-CoV-2 related

45

coronaviruses were nearly identical in sequence and clustered closely with a virus

46

previously identified in pangolins from Guangxi, China, although with a genetically

47

distinct spike gene sequence. We also identified 17 alphacoronavirus genomes,

48

including those closely related to swine acute diarrhea syndrome virus and porcine

49

epidemic diarrhea virus. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23

50

Rhinolophus bat species in Southeast Asia and southern China, with the largest

51

contiguous hotspots extending from South Lao and Vietnam to southern China. Our

52

study highlights both the remarkable diversity of bat viruses at the local scale and that

53

relatives of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV circulate in wildlife species in a broad

54

geographic region of Southeast Asia and southern China. These data will help guide

55

surveillance efforts to determine the origins of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic

56

coronaviruses.

Introduction

61

Most viral pathogens in humans have zoonotic origins, arising through occasional

62

(e.g. coronavirus, Ebola virus) or frequent (e.g. avian influenza A virus) animal

63

spillover infections. Bats (order Chiroptera) are the second most diverse mammalian

64

order after Rodentia and currently comprise ~1420 species, accounting for some 22%

65

of all named mammalian species (Letko et al., 2020). Bats are well known reservoir

66

hosts for a variety of viruses that cause severe diseases in humans, and have been

67

associated with the spillovers of Hendra virus, Marburg virus, Ebola virus and, most

68

notably, coronaviruses. Aside from bats and humans, coronaviruses can infect a wide

69

range of domestic and wild animals, including pigs, cattle, mice, cats, dogs, chickens,

70

deer and hedgehogs (Chan et al., 2013; Su et al., 2016; Corman et al., 2018).

71

By 2019 there were six known human coronaviruses (HCoV): HCoV-229E, HCoV-

72

OC43, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), HCoV-NL63,

73

HCoV-HKU1, and Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Su et al., 2016;

74

Forni et al., 2017). HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were

75

known to have zoonotic origins, with bats likely important reservoir hosts, although

76

sometimes emergence in humans followed transmission through so-called

77

“intermediate” hosts such as palm civets for SARS-CoV and dromedary camels for

78

MERS-CoV (Corman et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2020). Similarly, it has been proposed that

79

rodents may be the natural hosts of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, with cattle a

80

possible intermediate host for HCoV-OC43 (Corman et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2020).

81

In early 2020, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the causative

82

agent of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, that eventually turned into a global

83

pandemic (Zhu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a). A combination of

84

retrospective genome sequencing and ongoing sampling then identified a number of

85

SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses in wildlife. These included: (i) the bat

86

(Rhinolophus affinis) virus RaTG13 that is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 across

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

87

the viral genome as a whole (Zhou et al., 2020b); (ii) the bat (R. malayanus) derived

88

coronavirus RmYN02 that is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in the long ORF1ab

89

gene and which contains a similar nucleotide insertion at the S1/S2 cleavage site of

90

the spike gene (Zhou H et al., 2020a); (iii) viruses from the Malayan pangolin (Manis

91

javanica) that comprised two lineages reflecting their Chinese province of collection

92

by local customs authorities (Guangdong and Guangxi), with the pangolins from

93

Guangdong possessing identical amino acids at the six critical residues of the receptor

94

binding domain (RBD) to human SARS-CoV-2 (Lam et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020);

95

and (iv) a more distant SARS-CoV-2 related coronavirus from a bat (R. cornutus)

96

sampled in Japan (Murakami et al., 2020). More recently, two novel

97

betacoronaviruses (STT182 and STT200) were described in R. shameli bats sampled

98

from Cambodia in 2010 that share 92.6% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 as

99

well as five of the six critical RBD sites observed in SARS-CoV-2 (Hul et al., 2021).

100

In addition, a novel bat (R. acuminatus) coronavirus isolated from Thailand

101

(RacCS203) in June 2020 was recently identified and found to be closely related to

102

RmYN02 (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2021). Collectively, these studies indicate that

103

bats across a broad swathe of Asia harbor coronaviruses that are closely related to

104

SARS-CoV-2 and that the phylogenetic and genomic diversity of these viruses has

105

likely been underestimated. Herein, we report the discovery of additional bat

106

coronaviruses from Yunnan province, China that reveal more of the diversity and

107

complex evolutionary history of these viruses, including both cross-species

108

transmission and genomic recombination.

Identification of novel bat coronaviruses

111

From May 2019 to November 2020, a total of 283 fecal samples, 109 oral swabs and

112

19 urine samples were collected from bats in Yunnan province, China. The majority of

113

samples were collected from horseshoe bats, comprising: Rhinolophus malayanus

114

(n=88), R. stheno (n=36), R. sinicus (n=34), and R. siamensis (n=12), R. pusillus

115

(n=2), other Rhinolophus sp. (n=11), and Hipposideros larvatus (n=59) (Figure 1A

116

and 1B, Table S1). These samples were pooled into 100 libraries (numbered p1 to

117

p100) according to the collection date and host species, with each library containing

118

one to 11 samples. Meta-transcriptomic (i.e. total RNA) sequencing was performed

119

and coronaviruses contigs were identified in 40 libraries (Table S2). Blastn searches

120

of the de novo assemblies identified 26 long contigs (>23,000 nt in length) that

121

mapped to coronavirus genomes present in 20 libraries, including nine sarbecoviruses

122

(i.e. from the genus Betacoronavirus) and 17 alphacoronaviruses. The number of

123

read-pairs mapping to these long contigs ranged from 3,433 to 21,498,614, with the

124

average depth ranging from 35.86 to 215,065.00 (Table S3). It should be noted that

125

pool p1 comprising 11 fecal samples from R. malayanus was the same pool

126

previously used to identify RmYN01 and RmYN02 (Zhou et al., 2020a). The

127

remaining 24 genomes were named in the same manner, in which the first two letters

128

represent an abbreviation of the bat species, YN denotes Yunnan, and the final number

129

is a serial number ranging from 03 to 26. In addition, several short contigs related to

130

SARS-CoV-2 were identified in two other libraries - p7 and p11 (Figure S1, Table

131

S2).

132

Further Blastn analyses revealed that four of the seven novel sarbecoviruses identified

133

here (RpYN06, RsYN04, RmYN05, and RmYN08) were related to SARS-CoV-2

134

with nucleotide identities ranging from 82.46% to 97.21%, while the remaining three

135

(RsYN03, RmYN07, and RsYN09) were more closely related to SARS-CoV with

136

nucleotide identities ranging from 91.60% to 93.28%. We next designed specific

137

primers and a probe set of quantitative real-time PCR primers (qPCR) (Table S4) that

138

targeted the conserved region of the1a gene region to detect the presence of the four

139

SARS-CoV-2 related viruses in individual bats (i.e. prior to sample pooling; Figure

140

1C). Pool p46 only contained only a single positive fecal sample, no. 379, collected

141

on May 25, 2020, and the virus was detected with a cycle threshold (Ct) value of

142

26.97 (Figure 1C). SARS-CoV-2 related virus was also detected in three (sample nos.

143

362, 364, and 372) of the six, three (sample nos. 367, 391, and 397) of the eight, and

144

two (sample nos. 448 and 450) of the seven samples in pool nos. p35, 44 and 62,

145

respectively, with Ct values ranging from 26.10 to 32.82 (Figure 1C). Among these,

146

samples 362, 364, 372 and 367 were collected on May 25, 2020, 391 and 397 were

147

collected on June 3, 2020, while both 448 and 450 were collected on July 16, 2020.

148

The 5’ and 3’ termini and the spike gene sequences of the four coronaviruses related

149

to SARS-CoV-2 were verified using individual samples 379, 364, 367 and 450 with 5’

150

and 3’ RACE (Table S4) and Sanger sequencing. Results from Sanger sequencing

151

were consistent with those obtained from the meta-transcriptomic sequencing.

152

Sequence identities between SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses

153

At the scale of the whole genome, RpYN06 exhibited 94.5% sequence identity to

154

SARS-CoV-2, making it, after RaTG13 (96.0%), the second closest relative of SARS-

155

CoV-2 documented to date (Figure 2). However, because of extensive recombination,

156

patterns of sequence similarity vary markedly across the virus genome, and RmYN02

157

shared 97.18% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the 1ab open reading frame

158

(ORF), compared to 97.19% for RpYN06. In addition to the ORF1ab, RpYN06

159

shared the highest nucleotide identities with SARS-CoV-2 in the RdRp (RNA-

160

dependent RNA polymerase; 98.36%), ORF7a (96.72%), ORF8 (97.54%), N

161

(97.70%), and ORF10 (100%) (Figure 2, Table S5 and S6). However, RpYN06

162

exhibited only 76.3% nucleotide identity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene and 60.9% in

163

the receptor binding domain (RBD), thereby similar to RmYN02, ZC45, ZXC21 and

164

the Thailand coronavirus strains (Figure 2). Excluding the spike gene, the sequence

165

identities of RpYN06, RmYN02 and RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2 were 97.17%, 96.41%

166

and 96.49%, respectively.

167

In contrast, RsYN04, RmYN05 and RmYN08 exhibited >99.96% nucleotide

168

identities to each other at the scale of the whole genome. Such strong similarity is

169

indicative of viruses from the same species, even though they were sequenced on

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

170

different lanes and the samples were collected from different bat species at different

171

time points. In addition, they shared low nucleotide identities with SARS-CoV-2

172

across the whole genome (76.5%), particularly in the spike gene, ORF3a, ORF6,

173

ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 with nucleotide identities <70% (Figure 2). Interestingly,

174

when using RsYN04 as the query sequence, the closest hit in the Blastn search was

175

the pangolin derived coronavirus MP789 (MT121216.1) with 82.9% nucleotide

176

identity.

177

Evolutionary history of sarbecoviruses

178

Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome sequences of representative

179

sarbecoviruses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related to RaTG13, while

180

RmYN02 and the Thailand strains formed a slightly more divergent clade. Notably,

181

RpYN06 was placed at the basal position of the clade containing SARS-CoV-2 and its

182

closest relatives from bats and pangolins (Figure 3A, Table S6). In contrast, RsYN04,

183

RmYN05 and RmYN08 grouped together and clustered with the pangolin derived

184

viruses from Guangxi, although being separated from them by a relatively long

185

branch. Finally, three SARS-CoV related coronaviruses (RsYN03, RmYN07, and

186

RsYN09) fell within the SARS-CoV lineage, grouping with other bat viruses

187

previously sampled in Yunnan (Figure 3A).

188

A different topological pattern was observed in the phylogeny of the RdRp (Figure

189

3B). In particular, RpYN06 now grouped with RmYN02 (although with weak

190

bootstrap support), with together formed a clade with RaTG13, the two Cambodian

191

strains, and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3B). The two bat derived strains from Thailand

192

formed a separate lineage. Perhaps more striking was that RsYN04, RmYN05 and

193

RmYN08 now grouped with the Guangdong pangolin viruses (rather than those from

194

Guangxi; Figure 3B). A different pattern again was observed in the phylogeny of the

195

entire ORF1ab (Figure 3C). RpYN06 and RmYN02 now formed a clade and that was

196

the direct sister-group to SARS-CoV-2, with RaTG13 a little more divergent (Figure

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

197

3C). In addition, RsYN04, RmYN05 and RmYN08 now clustered with the pangolin

198

derived strains from Guangxi (Figure 3C), consistent with the complete genome

199

phylogeny.

200

In the spike gene phylogeny, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 still grouped together, with

201

both pangolin lineages falling as sister groups (Figure 3D). The two Cambodian bat

202

viruses formed a separate and more divergent lineage. Strikingly, RpYN06 exhibited

203

marked phylogenetic movement, this time clustering with two previously described

204

bat viruses from Zhejiang province - ZC45 and ZXC21 - whereas the Thailand bat

205

virus clustered closely with RmYN02 (Figure 3D). In addition, RsYN321B,

206

RmYN363B, and RmYN442B did not fall within the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

207

clades, but instead formed a separate and far more divergent lineage (Figure 3D).

208

Finally, in the phylogeny of the RBD region, SARS-CoV-2 clustered with the

209

pangolin viruses from Guangdong with the two Cambodian bat viruses the next most

210

closely related viruses (Figure S2). RpYN06 fell within a lineage comprising several

211

bat derived betacoronaviruses, including ZC45, ZXC21, RsYN09, RsYN03, and

212

RmYN07. As expected given the complete S gene tree, bat viruses RsYN04,

213

RmYN05 and RmYN08 grouped together and formed a lineage, characterized by a

214

long branch (Figure S2).

215

Molecular characterizations of the spike protein of the novel bat

216

sarbecoviruses

217

At the six amino acid positions deemed critical for binding to the human angiotensin-

218

converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor, SARS-CoV-2 and the three bat derived

219

viruses identified here (RsYN04, RmYN05 and RmYN08) shared L455 and Y505. In

220

contrast, despite being a closer overall relative, RpYN06 only possessed one identical

221

amino acid with SARS-CoV-2 - Y505 (Figure 4A). In the S1/S2 cleavage site of the

222

spike gene, none of the four SARS-CoV-2 related viruses reported here possessed a

223

similar insertion/deletion (indel) pattern as SARS-CoV-2 (Garry et al., 2021) (Figure

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

224

4A). Interestingly, however, the recently sampled bat virus from Thailand possessed a

225

PVA three amino acid insertion at this site, similar to the PAA insertion found in

226

RmYN02. In addition, two indel events have been identified in the RBD of many bat

227

associated coronaviruses (Holmes et al., 2021), including RpYN06 that was

228

characterized by indel patterns identical to those of ZC45 and ZXC21 (Figure 4A).

229

There were no indel events in SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin derived coronaviruses in

230

RBD, and RsYN04, RmYN05 and RmYN08 possessed one unique indel event

231

different from other sarbecoviruses (Figure 4A). In addition, and similar to other bat

232

derived coronaviruses, the four novel SARS-CoV-2 related viruses possessed several

233

indel events in the N-terminal domain, while RsYN04, RmYN05 and RmYN08 again

234

possessed a unique indel pattern (Figure S3). Notably, RpYN06, ZC45, ZXC21 and

235

the Guangdong pangolin virus shared the same indel pattern, with RpYN06 exhibiting

236

high amino acid identity to these viruses in the N-terminal domain (amino acid

237

identities ranging from 85.3% to 99.0%; Figure S4).

238

We predicted and compared the three-dimensional structures of RpYN06, RsYN04

239

and SARS-CoV-2 using homology modeling (Figures 4B-4D). In a similar manner to

240

RmYN02 (Zhou et al., 2020a), the RBD of RpYN06 had two shorter loops than those

241

observed in SARS-CoV-2, while RsYN04 only had one shorter loop (Figure 4D). In

242

addition, near the S1/S2 cleavage sites, the conformational loop of RpYN06 and

243

RsYN04 were different from those of SARS-CoV-2 (Figures 4B-4C). Notably,

244

RsYN04 exhibited greater amino acid identity (71.28%) and shared more structural

245

similarity with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD than RpYN06 (63.08%). Importantly, the

246

conformational variations caused by these amino acid substitutions and deletions were

247

speculated to interfere with the binding of RpYN06 and RsYN04 RBD to hACE2

248

(Figure 4D). However, RsYN04 exhibited lower structural similarity with SARS-

249

CoV-2 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) (Figure 4C, black arrowheads, 39.19% amino

250

acid identity) than RpYN06 (65.87% amino acid identity).

251

Phylogenetic analysis of the novel bat alphacoronaviruses

252

As well as betacoronaviruses, we identified 17 novel bat alphacoronaviruses.

253

Phylogenetic analyses of the full-length genomes (Figure 5A), the RdRp genes

254

(Figure 5B), and ORF1ab (Figure S5) of these 17 alphacoronaviruses and

255

representative background viruses were consistent, with all trees revealing that the

256

viruses newly identified here fell within four established subgenera: Decacovirus

257

(n=12), Pedacovirus (n=1), Myotacovirus (n=1), and Rhinacovirus (n=2) (Figure 5).

258

Of particular note were MlYN15 and RsYN25 isolated from Myotis laniger and R.

259

stheno bats that were closely related to swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus

260

(SADS-CoV) (Figure 5) (Zhou et al., 2018) sharing nucleotide identities 87.55% -

261

87.61%. In addition, HlYN18, isolated from a Hipposideros larvatus bat, fell within

262

the subgenus Pedacovirus, and was close to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus

263

(PEDV) lineage (Figure 5). Notably, the virus CpYN11 (isolated from Chaerephon

264

plicatus) clustered with WA3607 (GenBank accession no. MK472070; isolated from a

265

bat from Australia), which together might represent an unclassified subgenus (Figure

266

5). Finally, RsYN14, RmYN17, McYN19, and RmYN24, although isolated from

267

different bat species and sequenced on different lanes, they were almost identical

268

(with nucleotide identity >99.98% to each other) and might represent a novel species

269

of subgenus Decacovirus.

270

Although the phylogenetic trees of the spike gene (Figure S6A) and protein sequences

271

(Figure S6B) were topologically similar to those of the full-length genome, RdRp and

272

ORF1ab, a number of notable differences were apparent indicative of past

273

recombination events. First, CpYN11 clustered with HKU8 rather than WA3607 in

274

the spike gene tree where they formed a separate lineage. Second, the topology of the

275

subgenus Decacovirus in the spike gene tree was different to those observed in other

276

gene regions. Finally, the two viruses belonging to the subgenus Tegacovirus were

277

placed into the subgenera Pedacovirus (GenBank accession no. NC_028806) and a

278

separate lineage (GenBank accession no. DQ848678), respectively.

Ecological modeling of the distribution of Rhinolophus species in Asia

280

To better understand the ecology of bat coronaviruses, we modeled the distribution of

281

49 Rhinolophus species in Asia using the collated distribution data and several

282

ecological measures (Figures 6 and S7). The models performed well with a mean Area

283

Under Curve (AUC) of 0.96 for training and 0.92 for testing, and all training AUCs

284

were above 0.88. Continentality (reflecting the difference between continental and

285

marine climates) was, on average, the most important factor, contributing an average

286

of 14.91% (based on permutation importance), followed by temperature seasonality at

287

11.7% average contribution, mean diurnal temperature range at 5.69%, and annual

288

potential evapotranspiration at 5.38%. Three additional ecological factors also

289

contributed over 5% on average: minimum precipitation at 5.25%, potential

290

evapotranspiration seasonality at 5.17% and Emberger’s pluviothermic quotient (a

291

measure of climate type) at 5%. The next most important factor was the distance to

292

bedrock (an indicator of potential caves and rock outcrops) at 4.46%. Thus, local

293

climate, especially factors that influence diet availability across the year, is seemingly

294

key to determining bat species distributions across the region.

295

Although we could not accurately model diversity for Indonesia because of limited

296

recently available data and likely high endemism, mainland Southeast Asia was well

297

mapped (Figures 6 and S7). Most of mainland Southeast Asia’s remaining tropical

298

forests showed a high diversity of Rhinolophid bats, with a maximum of 23 species

299

estimated to exist concurrently (Figure 6A). Rhinolophid hotspots occurred in forests

300

throughout much of mainland Southeast Asia, with the largest contiguous hotspots

301

extending from South Lao and Vietnam to Southern China (Figure 6A). Hotspots

302

were also identified in the Hengduan mountains, and some parts of northern Myanmar

303

and Nagaland in India (Figure 6A).

304

Interestingly, R. affinis (Figure 6B) and R. pusillus (Figure 6C) were widely

305

distributed in Southeast Asia and southern China, and most bat species shared

306

hotspots in Cambodia and peninsula Thailand. Several Rhinolophid species extended

307

their ranges northwards into southern China reflecting the presence of forest (R.

308

affinis and R. pusillus), whereas the geographic range of R. malayanus only just

309

reached southern China (Figures 6D-6F). Ecological drivers for these species

310

unsurprisingly showed some differences. Specifically, R. affinis was also influenced

311

by temperature seasonality (16.59%), followed by Emberger’s pluviothermic quotient

312

and mean diurnal range (8.79, and 8.7%), while R. malayanus (a smaller species) was

313

mainly influenced by annual potential evapotranspiration mean (33.79%) and

314

seasonality (14.57%). R. pusillus was influenced by temperature seasonality (12.44%)

315

and continentality (9%), and R. shameli was largely influenced by annual potential

316

evapotranspiration seasonality (34.81%) followed by annual evapotranspiration

317

(9.79%). Overall, these factors control the range limits, and food availability for these

318

bat species.

319

It should be noted that the ecological modeling identified several other Rhinolophid

320

species with wide geographic distributions: R. huanensis, R. lepidus, R. luctus, R.

321

macrotis, R. marshalli, R. microglobosus, R. pearsoni, R. rouxii, R. stheno, R.

322

thomasi, and R. yunnanensis (Figure S7). Notably, R. stheno was found to host both

323

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in the present study.

324

Discussion

325

To reveal more of the diversity, ecology and evolution of bat viruses, we collected bat

326

samples in Yunnan province, China during 2019-2020. Overall, 40 of the 100

327

sequencing libraries contained coronaviruses, including seven libraries with contigs

328

that could be mapped to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we assembled 24 novel

329

coronavirus genomes from different bat species, including four SARS-CoV-2 like

330

coronaviruses. Further PCR based tests revealed that these four viruses tested positive

331

in nine individual samples collected in Yunnan province between May and July 2020.

332

Together with the SARS-CoV-2 related virus collected from Thailand in June 2020

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

333

(Wacharapluesadee et al., 2021), these results clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2

334

related viruses continue to circulate in bat populations, and in some regions the

335

prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses might be relatively high.

336

Of particular note was that one of the novel bat coronavirus identified here - RpYN06

337

- exhibited 94.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome as a whole

338

and in some individual gene regions (ORF1ab, ORF7a, ORF8, N, and ORF10) was

339

the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 identified to date. However, the low sequence

340

identity in the spike gene, itself clearly the product of a past recombination event,

341

made it a second closest relative of SARS-CoV-2, next to RaTG13, at the genomic

342

scale. Hence, aside from the spike gene, RpYN06 possessed a genomic backbone that

343

is arguably the closest to SARS-CoV-2 identified to date.

344

Although several SARS-CoV-2-like viruses have been identified from different

345

wildlife species that display high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in some

346

genomic regions, none are highly similar (e.g. >95%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the spike

347

gene in terms of both the overall sequence identity and the amino acid residues at

348

critical receptor binding sites (Zhou et al., 2020b; Lam et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020;

349

Zhou et al., 2020a; Murakami et al., 2020; Hul et al., 2021; Wacharapluesadee et al.,

350

2021). Indeed, the spike protein sequences of three of the novel coronaviruses

351

described here (RsYN04, RmYN05, RmYN08) formed an independent lineage

352

separated from known sarbecoviruses by a relatively long branch. In this context it is

353

interesting that the recently identified bat coronavirus from Thailand carried by a

354

three-amino acid-insertion (PVA) at the S1/S2 cleavage site (Wacharapluesadee et al.,

355

2021). Although this motif is different to that seen in SARS-CoV-2 (PRRA) and

356

RmYN02 (PAA), this once again reveals the frequent occurrence of indel events in

357

the spike proteins of naturally sampled betacoronaviruses (Garry et al., 2021; Holmes

358

et al., 2021). Collectively, these results highlight the extremely high, and likely

359

underestimated, genetic diversity of the sarbecovirus spike proteins, and which likely

360

reflects their adaptive flexibility.

361

Previous studies have revealed frequent host switching of coronaviruses among bats

362

(Latinne et al., 2020). Indeed, we identified nearly 100% identical coronaviruses from

363

multiple different bat species both in Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus,

364

indicative of the frequent cross-species virus transmission that drives virus evolution.

365

This in part likely reflects their roosting behavior and propensity to share the same or

366

close habitats. However, while facilitating host jumping, that individual bat species

367

can harbor multiple viruses increases the difficulty in resolving the origins of SARS-

368

CoV-2 and other pathogenic coronaviruses. Of particular note was that the three of the

369

newly identified SARS-CoV-2 like coronaviruses grouped together with the pangolin

370

derived coronaviruses from Guangxi in the whole genome phylogeny. Although the

371

associated branch lengths are relatively long such that other hosts may be involved,

372

and there are some topological differences between gene trees, this is suggestive of

373

virus transmission between pangolins and bats. Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 related

374

coronavirus was identified from a pangolin from Yunnan (GISAID ID

375

EPI_ISL_610156). Whether pangolin derived coronaviruses have formed a separate

376

lineage clearly warrants further investigation.

377

Rhinolophid bats are important hosts for coronaviruses (Fan et al., 2019; Latinne et

378

al., 2020). Our ecological modeling revealed high richness of Rhinolophids across

379

much of Southeast Asia and southern China, with up to 23 species projected to co-

380

exist from the 49 species included in analysis. The largest expanses of high bat

381

diversity habitat stretch from South Vietnam into southern China (Hughes et al., 2012;

382

Allen et al., 2017). Indeed, it is striking that all the bat viruses described here, as well

383

as RmYN01 and RmYN02 described previously (Zhou et al., 2020a), were identified

384

in a small area (~1100 hectare) in Yunnan province. This highlights the remarkable

385

phylogenetic and genomic diversity of bat coronaviruses in a tiny geographic area and

386

to which humans may be routinely exposed. Importantly, in addition to Rhinolophids,

387

this broad geographic region in Asia is rich in many other bat families (Anthony et al.,

388

2017) and other wildlife species (Olival et al., 2017) that have been shown to be

389

susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro (Conceição et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Sang et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

390

al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021). It is therefore essential that further surveillance efforts

391

should cover a broader range of wild animals in this region to help track ongoing

392

spillovers of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and other pathogenic viruses from animals to

393

humans.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

619

A total of 23 different bat species were tested in this study (Table S1). Samples were

620

collected between May 2019 and November 2020 from Mengla County, Yunnan

621

Province in southern China (101.271563 E, 21.918897 N; 101.220091 E, 21.593202

622

N and 101.297471 E, 21.920934 N). The Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden

623

has an ethics committee that provided permission for trapping and bat surveys within

624

this study.

625

METHOD DETAILS

626

Sample collection

627

A total of 411 samples from 342 bats were collected from the Xishuangbanna Tropical

628

Botanical Garden and its adjacent areas, Mengla County, Yunnan Province in southern

629

China between May 2019 and November 2020. Bats were trapped using harp traps

630

and a variety of samples were collected from each individual bat including feces

631

(n=283), oral swab (n=109) and urine (n=19). Fecal and swab samples were collected

632

and stored in RNAlater (Invitrogen), and urine samples were directly collected in the

633

RNase-free tubes. These bats were primarily identified according to morphological

634

criteria and found to belong to 23 different species, with the majority representing

635

horseshoe bats (n=183) containing Rhinolophus malayanus, R. stheno, R. sinicus, R.

636

siamensis, R. pusillus and other R. genus bats, as well as Hipposideros larvatus

637

(n=59) (Table S1). All bats were sampled alive and subsequently released. All samples

638

were transported on ice and then kept at -80°C until use.

639

Next generation sequencing

640

All bat samples were merged into 100 pools to generate sequencing libraries, based on

641

the sample types, bat species and collection date. Of these bat libraries, 18 libraries

642

have been described previously (Zhou et al., 2020a), including the library from which

643

the viruses RmYN01 and RmYN02 were identified. These 18 libraries were combined

644

with 82 additional libraries newly obtained here. Total RNA from samples was

645

extracted using RNAprep pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (TianGen) and aliquots of the RNA

646

solutions were then pooled in equal volume. Libraries were constructed using the

647

NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). Ribosomal (r)

648

RNA of fecal, oral swab and urine was removed using the TransNGS rRNA Depletion

649

(Bacteria) Kit (TransGen) and rRNA of tissues was removed using TransNGS rRNA

650

Depletion (Human/Mouse/Rat) Kit (TransGen), respectively. Paired-end (150 bp)

651

sequencing of each RNA library was performed on the NovaSeq 6000 platform

652

(Illumina) with the S4 Reagent Kit, and performed by the Novogene Bioinformatics

653

Technology (Beijing, China).

654

Genome assembly and annotation

655

Clean reads from the next generation sequencing were classified with Kraken (v2.0.9)

656

based on all microbial sequences from the NCBI nucleotide database. Paired-end

657

reads classified as from coronaviruses were extracted from the Kraken output. To

658

further verify the existence of coronaviruses, reads classified as coronaviruses were

659

assembled with MEGAHIT (v1.2.9). The contigs from MEGAHIT were searched by

660

BLASTn based on the NCBI nt database. Sequencing libraries with contigs identified

661

as representing coronavirus were de novo assembled with coronaSPAdes (v3.15.0).

662

The near complete genomes of coronavirus were then identified from the results of

663

coronaSPAdes by BLASTn searching.

(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

664

The newly assembled coronavirus genomes were validated by read mapping using

665

Bowtie2 (v2.4.1). The coverage and depth of coronavirus genomes were calculated

666

with SAMtools (v1.10) based on SAM files from Bowtie2. To further improve the

667

quality of the genome annotations, SAM files of the reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2

668

were checked manually with Geneious (v2021.0.1), extending the ends as much as

669

possible. The open reading frames (ORFs) of the verified genome sequences were

670

annotated using Geneious (v2021.0.1) and then checked with closed references from

671

NCBI. The taxonomy of these newly assembled coronavirus genome were determined

672

by online BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).

673

Coronavirus contigs produced by MEGAHIT (v1.2.9) were analyzed to evaluate the

674

existence of coronavirus sequences in each library. To mitigate the possibility of false

675

positives due to index hopping, coronavirus contigs from different libraries within the

676

same chip and same lane were compared, and if a shorter contig shared >99%

677

nucleotide sequence identity with a longer contig from another library, the shorter one

678

was removed.

679

Sanger sequencing

680

The assembled genome sequences of the beta-CoVs identified here were further

681

confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), PCR amplification and Sanger

682

sequencing. A TaqMan-based qPCR was first performed to test the feces of pools p19,

683

p35, p44, p46, p52 and p62, as these contained beta-CoVs according to the

684

metagenomic analysis. cDNA synthesis was performed using the ReverTra Ace qPCR

685

RT Kit (TOYOBO). The qPCR reaction was undertaken using a set of probe and

686

primer pairs (Table S4) in the Pro Taq HS Premix Probe qPCR Kit (AG) with a

687

LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche).

688

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The sequences of the 5ʹ and 3ʹ termini

689

were obtained by RACE using the SMARTer RACE 5’/3’ Kit and 3'-Full RACE Core

690

Set (Takara), according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some minor

691

modifications. Two sets of gene-specific primers (GSPs) and nested-GSPs (NGSPs)

692

for 5ʹ and one set for 3ʹ RACE PCR amplification were designed based on the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.08.434390; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

693

assembled genome sequences of six beta-CoVs (Table S3). The first round of

694

amplification was performed by touchdown PCR, while the second round comprised

695

regular PCR. The PCR amplicons of ~1000 bp fragments of the two regions were

696

obtained separately and sequenced with the amplified primer or gel purified followed

697

by ligation with the pMD18-T Simple Vector (TaKaRa) and transformation into

698

competent Escherichia coli DH5α (Takara). Insertion products were sequenced with

699

M13 forward and reverse primers.

700

Amplification of beta-CoVs S gene and the host COI gene. Based on the spike gene

701

and the adjacent sequences of RsYN04, RmYN05, RmYN08 and RpYN06, 9 primer

702

pairs were designed for Sanger sequencing (Table S4). The cDNAs reverse

703

transcribed above were used as templates. The thermal cycling parameters of PCR

704

amplification were as follows: 5 mins at 95°C; followed by 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 50°C

705

(an exception of 55°C for primers 379SF5/379SR5), 1 min at 72°C for 30 cycles; and

706

10 min at 72°C. A second round PCR was then performed under the same conditions

707

with the corresponding PCR products used as templates. Further confirmation of host

708

species was based on analysis of the cytochrome b (cytb) gene obtained from the

709

assembled contigs. We also amplified and sequenced the fragment of cytochrome c

710

oxidase subunit I (COI) gene using primers VF1/VR1 (Ivanova et al., 2007). Briefly,

711

the following touchdown PCR conditions were used: 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 52°C to

712

45°C, 45 s at 72°C for 14 cycles; and followed by 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 45°C, 45 s at

713

72°C for 30 cycles.

714

Bioinformatics analyses

715

Phylogenetic analysis. Multiple sequence alignment of the alphacoronavirus and

716

betacoronavirus nucleotide sequences was performed using MAFFT (v7.450).

717

Phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and major genes were performed using

718

the maximum likelihood (ML) method available in RAxML (v8.2.11) with 1000

719

bootstrap replicates, employing the GTR nucleotide substitution model and a gamma

720

distribution of rate variation among sites. The resulting phylogenetic trees were

721

visualized using Figtree (v1.4.4).

722

Sequence identity and recombination analysis. Pairwise sequence identity of the

723

complete viral genome and genes between SARS-CoV-2 and representative

724

sarbecoviruses was calculated using Geneious (v2021.0.1). A whole genome sequence

725

similarity plot was performed using Simplot (v3.5.1), with a window size of 1000bp

726

and a step size of 100bp.

727

Site and structural analysis of the spike gene. The three-dimensional structures of

728

the S1 protein from RpYN06, RsYN04 and SARS-CoV-2 were modeled using the

729

Swiss-Model program (Waterhouse et al., 2018) employing PDB: 7A94.1 as the

730

template. Molecular images were generated with an open-source program - PyMOL.

731

Multiple sequence alignment of spike gene amino acid sequences was performed with

732

Clustal Omega (v1.2.2).

733

Ecological modeling

734

Data was collated using a combination of that from Hughes 2019, from various online

735

repositories (Table S7), and additional GBIF data collated between 2017 and 2021.

736

Further data was downloaded for Indonesia since 1990, even though wide-scale

737

deforestation means that most species are to still likely to occupy small parts of their

738

range. This provided sufficient data to model 49 Rhinolophid species based on 8418

739

occurrence points (once any duplicate points of species recorded repeatedly at the

740

same location had been removed), with almost all records collected since 1998.

741

Variables were selected to provide a good simulation of the environmental conditions

742

that may shape species distributions, whilst minimizing the number of variables to

743

allow modelling of species with few occurrence records. Variables included a number

744

of bioclimatic parameters (1,2,4,5,11,12,13,14,15 : http://worldclim.org/version2) in

745

addition to productivity and other climate metrics (NDVI, seasonality, actual

746

evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration seasonality and mean annual potential

747

evapotranspiration, aridity, Emberger’s pluviotonic quotient, continentality,

748

thermicity, maximum temperature of the coldest month - http://envirem.github.io/) -

749

and both NDVI seasonality and mean). In addition, we included some topographic

750

variables including soil pH, distance to bedrock, average tree height and tree density.

751

All variables were clipped to a mask of Tropical Southeast Asia and southern China at

752

a resolution of 0.008 decimal degrees (approximately 1km2) in ArcMap 10.3, then

753

converted to asci format for modelling.

754

Models of Rhinolophid diversity were run in Maxent 3.4.4. Five replicates were run

755

for each species, and the average taken before reclassifying with the 10th percentile

756

cumulative logistic threshold to form binary maps for each species (see Hughes et al.,

757

2013). AUC for training and testing was 0.96 and 0.92 respectively, and all training

758

AUCs were above 0.88.

759

Because of complex regional biogeography, optimal species habitat can exist in areas

760

that have not been colonized. Therefore, we downloaded mapped ranges for 39 of the

761

49 species modelled from the IUCN (https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/spatial-

762

data-download). Bats were extracted from this data, clipped to match the study area.

763

We then divided the IUCN data into five regions; mainland Southeast Asia,

764

Philippines, Java-Sumatra, Borneo and Sulawesi-Moluccas, using shapefiles of each

region to clip out bats listed there. This was collated to form a spreadsheet listing each

766

zone each species was listed in, and then the appropriate shapefiles used to determine

767

the ranges of each species (although only 39 of the 49 species could be treated in this

768

way). Each species was then remosaiced with the mask to provide a binary

769

distribution map, removing any potentially suitable areas that were outside the species

770

biogeographic range. Stricter filters were not used, because for the majority of species

771

there is not a clear analysis of genuine delineations of species ranges of if these

772

species are migratory. These binary mosaicked maps were then summed with the

773

other ten species using the mosaic tool to generate a map of richness for the region.
