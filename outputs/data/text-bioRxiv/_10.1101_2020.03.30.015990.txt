Abstract

28

The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly, highlighting the urgent need for an

29

efficient approach to rapidly develop therapeutics and prophylactics against

30

SARS-CoV-2. We describe here the development of a phage-displayed single-domain

31

antibody library by grafting naïve CDRs into framework regions of an identified

32

human germline IGHV allele. This enabled the isolation of high-affinity

33

single-domain antibodies of fully human origin. The panning using SARS-CoV-2

34

RBD and S1 as antigens resulted in the identification of antibodies targeting five

35

types of neutralizing or non-neutralizing epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. These fully

36

human single-domain antibodies bound specifically to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with

37

subnanomolar to low nanomolar affinities. Some of them were found to potently

38

neutralize pseudotyped and live virus, and therefore may represent promising

39

candidates for prophylaxis and therapy of COVID-19. This study also reports unique

40

immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to that of SARS-CoV and

41

MERS-CoV, which may have important implications for the development of effective

42

vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

Recently, an outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly around

the globe

human

50

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).

51

This marks the third major outbreak caused by a new coronavirus in the past two

52

decades, following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and

53

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Furthermore,

54

SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most transmissible coronaviruses identified so far, with the

55

coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quickly accelerating into a global pandemic. These

56

facts highlight the urgent need for an efficient approach to rapidly develop

57

therapeutics and prophylactics against SARS-CoV-2, which could not only be

58

potentially implemented in dealing with COVID-19 during the current outbreak, but

59

also strengthen our preparedness and response capacity against emerging

60

coronaviruses in the future.

infections

globally,

including

29,891

deaths

61

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are showing unprecedented value, and represent

62

the largest and fastest-growing sector in pharmaceutical industry. During the previous

63

SARS and MERS outbreaks, a number of neutralizing mAbs have been developed

64

and proved their therapeutic potential in the treatment of coronavirus infections

65

Despite this, their clinical usefulness has been hampered by the time-consuming and

66

costly antibody manufacturing processes in eukaryotic systems. The large-scale

67

production of mAbs typically takes at least 3 to 6 months, making them difficult to be

68

timely produced and used in an epidemic setting. An attractive alternative for mAbs is

single-domain antibodies from camelid immunoglobulins, termed VHH or nanobodies

70

that are the smallest naturally occurring antigen-binding protein domains with a

71

molecular weight of 12-15 kDa 11. Their small size provides several advantages over

72

conventional mAbs (150 kDa), including larger number of accessible epitopes,

73

relatively low production costs, and easiness of rapid production at kilogram scale in

74

prokaryotic expression systems. More importantly, nanobodies can be administered

75

by inhaled delivery due to the small size and favorable biophysical characteristics,

76

and thus are considered to be particularly suitable for the treatment of respiratory

77

diseases 12. For instance, ALX-0171, an inhaled anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

78

nanobody developed by Ablynx, was found to have robust antiviral effects and reduce

79

signs and symptoms of RSV infection in animal models, and well tolerated at all

80

doses when administered by inhalation in clinical trials

81

the feasibility of administering nanobodies via inhalation. However, the camelid

82

origin of nanobodies limits their application as therapeutics in human. To reduce the

83

risk of immunogenicity, strategies for humanization of camelid nanobodies have

84

become available in recent years but suffered from time- and labor-consuming

85

Besides, humanized nanobodies still retain a small number of camelid residues,

86

especially those within the framework region 2 (FR2), in order to maintain the

87

solubility and antigen-binding affinity of parental antibodies 11,14.

13

. These findings confirmed

11

.

88

In contrast to the camelid nanobodies which are naturally devoid of light chains,

89

heavy chain variable domains (VH) of conventional antibodies are paired with light

90

chain variable domains (VL), and generally poorly expressed or easy to aggregate in

91

the absence of light chains. It was proposed that several specific “hallmark” residues

92

(F37, E44, R45, and G47) within FR2 may contribute to the high solubility and

93

stability of isolated nanobodies

94

sequences from a public database revealed that their FR2 regions are relatively

95

divergent including the hallmark residues which have been considered to be strictly

96

conserved (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, we and others have previously identified some

97

isolated human VH single domains, which were independently folded and exhibited

98

very similar biophysical properties to camelid nanobodies

99

inspired us to revisit the structural feature of single-domain antibodies, and

100

hypothesize that certain VH framework regions could compensate for the absence of

101

VL, resulting in the soluble human single-domain antibodies. Therefore, we first

102

searched the IMGT database for the human IGHV alleles sharing the same germline

103

framework regions (FR1, FR2, or FR3) with m36, an HIV-1 neutralizing VH that was

104

found to be highly soluble and stable. As a result, 17 human germline IGHV alleles,

105

along with a camelid nanobody (VHH#3) as control

106

Escherichia coli, and characterized for their biophysical properties (Fig. 1b). Nine out

107

of 17 alleles could be highly expressed with yields of over 10 mg/L bacterial culture,

108

and 10 out of 17 possess protein A binding capabilities. Notably, germline 3-66*01

109

exhibited the most advantageous properties, including comparable midpoint transition

110

temperature (Tm) to that of nanobody measured by intrinsic protein fluorescence, and

111

the highest aggregation temperature (Tagg) among all tested single-domain antibodies

112

measured by static light scattering. These results confirmed the feasibility of using

113

human single-domain antibodies as ideal alternatives to camelid nanobodies in

114

therapeutic applications.

115

Next, we aimed to establish a generalizable platform for rapid development of

116

human single-domain antibodies. We used germline 3-66*01 framework regions as

117

the scaffold for grafting of heavy chain CDRs cloned from several naïve antibody

118

libraries. These libraries were previously constructed from the blood of healthy adult

119

donors, and their effectiveness has been proved by the successful isolation of potent

120

germline-like human monoclonal antibodies against various targets such as H7N9

121

avian influenza virus

122

grafting resulted in a very large and highly diverse phage-displayed single-domain

123

antibody library (size ~2×1011). To validate the quality of the library, several parallel

124

bio-panning were performed against a set of representative antigens, including viral

125

antigen, cytokine, and surface antigens on immune or tumor cells. In all the tests,

126

potent phage enrichments were observed after two or three rounds of panning (Fig.

127

1c), and panels of single-domain antibodies could be identified with binding affinities

128

in the low nanomolar/subnanomolar range (Fig. 1d). These antibodies are monomeric

129

and could be solubly expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli with yields ranging

130

from 15 to 65 mg/L culture. Moreover, their sequences are of fully human origin with

131

minimal divergence from the germline predecessors.

This technology enabled us to rapidly develop fully human single-domain

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. To this end, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of

134

SARS-CoV-2 was produced and biotinylated at a specific site for use as the target

135

antigen during bio-panning. Significant enrichment was achieved after two rounds of

136

panning, and a panel of 37 unique single-domain antibodies was identified using the

137

soluble expression-based monoclonal ELISA. According to the sequence similarities

138

among these antibodies, 18 of them were selected for further studies. They bound

139

potently and specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with subnanomolar to nanomolar

140

affinities as measured by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and ELISA (Fig. 2 and

141

Supplementary Fig. 1). Most of the antibodies displayed the fast-on/slow-off kinetic

142

pattern, except for n3063 which had the slow-on/slow-off binding kinetics with the

143

slowest rate constant of association (kon = 9.0 103 M-1s-1) and dissociation (koff =

144

4.5 10-4 s-1). The antibody n3021, in contrast, had the fastest association rate (kon =

M-1s-1), resulting in the highest binding affinity (KD = 0.6 nM) among all

147

To test whether these single-domain antibodies recognize different epitopes on

148

RBD, the competition binding assays were performed, and the percentage of binding

149

during competition compared to non-competed binding was quantitatively measured

150

(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that 18 antibodies could be divided into

151

three competition groups (group A, B or C) that did not show any competition with

152

each other. Most of the group A antibodies competed strongly with each other for

153

binding to RBD, indicating that they recognized the same epitope. These results

154

suggest that group A, B and C antibodies bound to different epitopes on RBD.

155

To further elucidate their binding epitopes, we measured the competition of

156

single-domain antibodies and human ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Fig. 2a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.015990; this version posted March 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

157

and Supplementary Fig. 3). The antibodies n3063 (group B) and n3010 (group C) did

158

not show any competition, while all the group A antibodies showed moderate

159

competition with ACE2 for the binding to RBD. Therefore, the epitopes targeted by

160

group A antibodies may be located within or adjacent to the ACE2-binding motifs of

161

RBD.

162

To investigate the potential of these single-domain antibodies in neutralizing

163

SARS-CoV-2, we measured their inhibitory activities in a well-established

164

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection assay. To our surprise, none of these antibodies

165

showed efficient neutralization at 50 μg/ml (data not shown), implying that moderate

166

competition with ACE2 is not sufficient for potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

167

Interestingly, we also found that the group C antibody n3010 bound potently to

168

SARS-CoV-2 RBD but did not show any binding to S1 protein, indicating that it

169

recognized a cryptic epitope hidden in S1. These results taken together suggest that

170

some non-neutralizing epitopes are relatively immunogenic in the isolated

171

SARS-CoV-2 RBD, in contrast to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in which the

172

neutralizing subregion were found to be highly immunogenic 22.

173

Next, we performed another set of panning using SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein instead

174

of RBD as the target antigen in order to isolate single-domain antibodies targeting

175

more diverse epitopes. A panel of 41 unique antibodies were identified after 4 rounds

176

of panning. Notably, two of them were found to be identical to the previously isolated

177

group A antibody n3021 or group B antibody n3063. The binding of 6 representative

178

antibodies (n3072, n3077, n3086, n3088, n3113 and n3130) to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or

179

RBD were measured by ELISA and BLI (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Most of

180

them showed potent binding to both S1 and RBD, while only one antibody, n3072,

181

had strong binding to S1 but no binding to RBD (Fig. 3a,c). The competition binding

182

assay suggests that n3077 recognized the same epitope as the previously identified

183

group A antibodies (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 5). The other 4 antibodies could

184

be divided into two distinct competition groups, group D (n3088, n3130) and group E

185

(n3086, n3113). These two groups had no competition with each other or with

186

previously identified antibodies for RBD binding, indicating that two novel epitopes

187

on SARS-CoV-2 RBD were identified by this new panel of single-domain antibodies.

188

We further measured the neutralization activities of these antibodies using the

189

pseudovirus neutralizing assay. As shown in Fig. 4a, the group D antibodies exhibited

190

potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The most potent antibody, n3130,

191

could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection with >90% neutralization at 10

192

μg/ml. The other group D antibody n3088 neutralized ~80% pseudovirus at 10 μg/ml.

193

The group E antibodies n3086 and n3113 showed moderate neutralization activities,

194

which inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner with

195

IC50 values of 26.6 and 18.9µg/ml, respectively. The group A antibody n3021 and

196

group B antibody n3063 could neutralize pseudovirus only at concentrations higher

197

than 50

198

activity. We next tested the neutralization of group D and E antibodies against live

199

SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 4b). Single-domain antibodies at 20 µg/ml were mixed with

200

200 PFU SARS-CoV-2 and observed for cytopathic effects (CPE) on Vero E6 cells.

μg/ml,

and group C antibody n3010 did not show evident neutralization

201

Similarly, no CPE was observed for n3130 and only very slight sign of CPE was

202

found for n3088, while a significant level of CPE was detected in the wells containing

203

group E antibodies.

204

It is very intriguing that the panning using SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD protein as

205

antigen resulted in substantially different spectra of antibodies. The single-domain

206

antibodies identified from S1 panning were very diverse, covering four distinct

207

epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD (competition groups A, B, D and E). In contrast, most

208

of the antibodies from RBD panning belonged to the competition group A,

209

represented by n3021 which was also the most dominant clone after two rounds of

210

panning. Furthermore, the group A antibodies showed moderate competition with

211

ACE2 for RBD binding but insufficient to provide effective viral neutralization. This

212

phenomenon is quite different from that of SARS-CoV, in which the dominance of an

213

antigenic loop within RBD makes it relatively easy to isolate potent SARS-CoV

214

neutralizing antibodies independent of repertoire, species, quaternary structure, and

215

the technology used to derive the antibodies

216

MERS-CoV S1 or RBD to isolate antibodies from a naïve antibody library, and the

217

panning using either of the two antigens led to dominant enrichment of m336 and

218

m336-like monoclonal antibodies, which precisely targeted 90% of the receptor

219

binding site within RBD and neutralized the virus potently

220

viruses like SARS-CoV perhaps did not have sufficient evolutionary time to evolve

221

their membrane glycoproteins to avoid direct immune recognition of a single site

222

critical to the virus pathogenesis 22. It is noteworthy to point out that the difference in

22

223

the immunogenicity of RBD was observed solely based on in vitro experiments, and it

224

may not correlate with humoral immune responses in vivo. In this regard, it is

225

imperative to investigate the immunogenic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with

226

special attention to the potentially antigenic and non-neutralizing epitopes. Besides,

227

another interesting finding is that the SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies

228

from competition groups D and E are not capable of competing with ACE2 for

229

SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 6). We found that the

230

group E antibody n3113 did not exhibit any binding to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2

231

isolate SZTH-004 that had two mutations (N341D/D351Y) to the most prevelant

232

isolate (Fig. 4c), indicating that the epitope of group D antibodies was located at a

233

region surrounding N341 or D351 which is distinct from the ACE2 binding site (Fig.

234

4d). This phenomenon was

235

SARS-CoV-specific human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, as far as we know,

236

competed with ACE2 for binding to the spike protein. CR3022, a cross-reactive

237

human monoclonal antibody that could neutralize SARS-CoV and was found to bind

238

potently to SARS-CoV-2 RBD

239

These findings confirmed the unique immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2. Further

240

investigations are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms that govern these

241

diverse sets of neutralizing and non-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, which may

242

have important implications for the development of effective vaccines.

243

The fully human single-domain antibodies offer the potential for prevention and

244

treatment of COVID-19. First, antibodies derived entirely of human sequences would

245

be less immunogenic than camelid or humanized nanobodies, leading to improved

246

safety and efficacy when used in humans. Indeed, despite humanization,

247

caplacizumab, the first nanobody approved by FDA still contains multiple camelid

248

residues to maintain the antigen binding affinity. Second, the small size and favorable

249

biophysical properties allows for large-scale production of single-domain antibodies

250

within a few weeks in prokaryotic expression systems, and thus enables rapid

251

implementation in an outbreak setting. Furthermore, single-domain antibodies could

252

be delivered to the lung via inhalation, which may offer considerable advantages for

253

treatment of COVID-19 including fast onset of action, low systemic exposure, and

254

high concentration of therapeutics at the site of disease. Lastly, single-domain

255

antibodies can be used alone or synergistically with other neutralizing antibodies.

256

Their small size making them ideal building block for generation of bispecific or

257

multi-specific antibodies to prevent the appearance of viral escape mutants. They can

258

also be easily engineered to further increase the neutralization activity by increasing

259

binding moieties. For instance, the trivalent nanobody ALX-0171 was found to have

260

6,000-fold increased neutralization potency against RSV-A and >10,000-fold against

261

RSV-B compared to its monovalent format 25.

262

In summary, we report here the development of a versatile platform for rapid

263

isolation of fully human single-domain antibodies, and its application for screening of

264

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. A variety of single-domain antibodies have been

265

isolated targeting five types of epitopes on SARS-CoV-2, and the antibody n3130 was

266

found to potently neutralize both pseudotyped and live virus. These antibodies may

a, We tested 18 human single-domain antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD in

312

competition binding assays. Top: competition of human single-domain antibodies

313

with ACE2 for RBD binding. The single-domain antibodies are displayed in three

314

groups (A, B or C) based on a competition binding assay. The values are the

315

percentage of binding that occurred during competition compared to non-competed

316

binding, which was normalized to 100%, and the range of competition is indicated by

317

the box colours. Black filled boxes indicate strongly competing pairs (residual binding

318

<30%), grey filled boxes indicate intermediate competition (residual binding

319

30–69%), and white filled boxes indicate non-competing pairs (residual binding

320

≥70%). b, Binding of human single-domain antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD or S1 as
