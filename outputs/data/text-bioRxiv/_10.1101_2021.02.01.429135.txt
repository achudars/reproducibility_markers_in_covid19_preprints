Summary
Characteristic properties of type III CRISPR-Cas systems include recognition of target
RNA (rather than DNA) and the subsequent induction of a multifaceted immune
response. This involves sequence-specific cleavage of a target RNA and production of
cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second messenger molecules that may trigger dormancy or
cell death. In this study, we discovered that a largely exposed seed region at the 3’ end
of the crRNA is essential for target RNA binding and cleavage, whereas base pairing at a
unique region at the 5’ end of the guide is required to trigger cOA production. Moreover,
we uncovered that the natural variation in the composition of type III complexes within a
single host results in different guide lengths, and hence variable seed regions. This
shifting seed may prevent escape by invading genetic elements, while controlling cOA
production very tightly to prevent unnecessary damage to the host. Lastly, we used
these findings to develop a new diagnostic tool, named SCOPE, which was used for the
specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 from human nasal swab samples, showing sensitivities
in the atto-molar range.

Introduction
As a widespread prokaryotic adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/CRISPR-associated) systems target and cleave
genetic material of viruses and other mobile genetic elements (MGEs) [1]–[4]. A CRISPR
array is composed of alternating repeat and spacer sequences, typically with the repeats
consisting of identical sequences and the spacers consisting of variable sequence
fragments acquired from invading MGEs [5]–[7]. The CRISPR array is generally located
adjacent to a set of CRISPR-associated (cas) genes encoding the Cas proteins.
In type III CRISPR-Cas systems, the CRISPR array is expressed and processed into
mature CRISPR RNA (crRNA) by the Cas6 ribonuclease [8]. A second maturation event
occurs where the crRNA is trimmed at the 3’ end [9][10]. The matured and trimmed
crRNAs form a ribonucleoprotein complex together with a set of Cas proteins: the type III
effector complex (Figure 1A). In the interference stage, type III complexes specifically
bind and degrade target RNA sequences (protospacers) complementary to the bound
crRNA guides.
Unlike other CRISPR-Cas systems that exclusively target either DNA (type I, II and V) or
RNA (type VI), many type III systems have the capacity to target both nucleic acids
[11]–[15][16][17]. Structural and biochemical analyses of the multi-subunit type III
complexes have revealed the subunits responsible for these activities and showed that
they are induced in a step-wise manner, starting with the binding of a complementary
target RNA [15][18]–[23]. Target RNA binding activates the RNase activity of Cas7,
which is present in multiple copies and constitutes the backbone of type III complexes.
As such, type III interference complexes have multiple (2-4) active sites, cleaving the
target RNA at 6 nt intervals (Figure 1A) [12][15][18][24][25]. Simultaneously, target
RNA binding activates two distinct catalytic domains of the Cas10 protein, the large
subunit of type III complexes. Activation of the HD domain of Cas10 confers sequencenonspecific DNase activity [14][16][26], while activation of its Palm domain triggers
oligoadenylate cyclase activity, producing cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second messenger
molecules that allosterically activate effector CARF (CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold)
proteins [27][28][27][28]. Most of the CARF proteins that have been characterized so far
appear to be promiscuous RNases, cleaving both viral and host RNAs, thereby potentially
inducing cell dormancy or cell death [29][30][31][32].
Previously, we characterized the structural and enzymatic features of the endogenous
type III-B Cmr complex from T. thermophilus HB8 (TtCmr) [23][18]. We showed that
TtCmr adopts a structure similar to type I (Cascade) complexes: a Cas7 (Cmr4)
backbone with multiple copies of the small subunit Cas11 (Cmr5). The complex is capped
at one end by the large subunit Cas10 (Cmr2) and Cas5 (Cmr3) and is capped at the
other end with two more Cas7-like subunits (Cmr1 and Cmr6) [23]. It is important to
note that the Cas10 subunit of the TtCmr complex lacks the HD domain, and hence does
not have DNase activity [18]. The mature crRNA runs along the Cas7 backbone of the
complex, with its 5’ repeat-derived end (the 5’ handle) anchored by Cas10/Cas5, and its
3’ end located at the Cmr1/Cmr6 end [20][24][33]. Interestingly, the 3’ end of the
mature crRNA is variable in type III systems, due to an uncharacterized 3’ processing
event following the endonucleolytic cleavages of Cas6 [36][37]. Although the details of
this 3’ processing event are not known, it is hypothesized that the heterogenous nature
of the TtCmr complex might be responsible for this, as is explained below.
Firstly, analysis of the crRNA-content of the endogenous TtCmr complex showed that it
indeed co-purifies with mature crRNAs of different sizes (with variable 3’ ends), with a
distinct 6-nt pattern: 34, 40 & 46 nt [18]. Secondly, our cryo-EM structures revealed that
the native population of TtCmr complexes consisted of larger (with a stoichiometry of
Cmr1 2 3 4 5 6 ) and smaller complexes (i.e. Cmr1 2 3 4 5 6 and Cmr1 2 3 4 5 6 ),

with the smaller complexes lacking one or two Cas7–Cas11 (Cmr4-Cmr5) backbone
segment(s) (Figure 1A). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the 3’ end of
the mature crRNA is determined by the stoichiometry of the TtCmr complex. In this
scenario, it is likely that the 3’ end is generated by a (non-Cas) host ribonuclease, such
as PNPase, that shortens the unprotected, protruding 3’ end of the bound crRNA [36].
In this study, we set out to understand the biological significance of these differently
sized Cmr complexes. This has revealed an unexpected flexible seed region at the 3’ end
of the crRNA guides, that might be important for these systems to prevent phage
escapees. Additionally, we identified a fixed region at the 5’ end of the crRNA that
triggers the catalytic activities of Cas10, thereby ensuring tight control over CARF protein
activation. These characteristics formed the basis for the development of a highlysensitive novel type III diagnostics platform called SCOPE (Screening using CRISPR
Oligoadenylate-Perceptive Effectors).

Results

TtCmr complexes consist of a heterogenous mixture of distinct compositions
We previously demonstrated that endogenous type III-B Cmr complexes purified from T.
thermophilus HB8 (TtCmr) are loaded with mature crRNA guides of different lengths (3440-46 nt), and that the crRNA-4.5 (CRISPR array 4, spacer 5) is most abundant (Figure
1A)[18]. This endogenous Cmr complex specifically cleaves complementary target RNAs
(4.5 target RNA) at 6 nt intervals, corresponding to the Cas7 subunits in the backbone of
the complex. Consequently, this results in 5’ labeled degradation products of 39 (α), 33
(β), 27 (γ) and 21 (δ) nucleotides (Figure 1B). However, the heterogeneous nature of the
crRNA-content of the endogenous Cmr complexes [18][23], complicates the
interpretation of these results. Therefore, to further reveal the mechanism of target RNA
cleavage, we used E.coli-produced subunits to reconstitute three different
Cmr complexes bound to a single crRNA (crRNA-4.5) of a defined length. We chose to
include crRNA lengths of either 34 (TtCmr-34), 40 (TtCmr-40) or 46 nt (TtCmr46), based on their abundance in their native host [18]. Opposed to all four (α-δ) 5’ labeled degradation products observed with the endogenous complex, each of the
reconstituted complexes produced defined degradation products decreasing in size with a
longer crRNA (Figure 1C). This is consistent with the idea that the composition of the
complex corresponds to the length of the crRNA, with larger complexes (e.g. TtCmr-46)
harboring more cleavage sites, hence cleaving more closely to the labeled 5’ end of the
target RNA. Smaller complexes, such as TtCmr-40 and TtCmr-34, lack one or two Cas7–
Cas11 (Cmr4-Cmr5) backbone segment(s), respectively, and therefore cleave the target
RNA at less and more distal locations (further away from the 5’ label), resulting in larger
degradation products. These results show that the population of
endogenous TtCmr complexes is a heterogenous mixture of bigger and smaller
complexes, cleaving their cognate target RNAs at different positions.

A flexible 3’ seed region regulates target cleavage and cyclic oligoadenylate
production
To investigate the significance of these type III complexes with different stoichiometries,
we performed activity assays to probe for differences in seed requirements for
RNA targeting as well as for the production of cyclic oligoadenylate (cOA) second
messengers. In the structurally similar type I effector complexes (i.e. the Cascade
complex), DNA targeting is governed by two factors: the PAM (protospacer adjacent
motif) and the seed [37]–[39]. In the RNA targeting type III systems, however, self/nonself discrimination is conferred by an rPAM (RNA protospacer-adjacent motif) [14]. This
motif checks for complementarity between the 5’ handle of the crRNA (8 nucleotides,
referred to as nucleotides -8 to -1) and the corresponding 3’ region flanking the
protospacer [14][16][42] (Figure 2A). Since TtCmr is devoid of DNase activity [18][23]
we tested whether RNase activity and production of cOA are affected by target RNAs
with complementarity to the 5’ handle of the crRNA (Figure 2A). The cleavage activity
assays with the endogenous Cmr complex showed that these ‘self-like’ substrates had
no substantial effect on RNA cleavage activity (Figure 2B). To probe for their impact on
cOA production, we developed a pyrophosphatase-based assay that directly reflects the
oligoadenylate oligomerization, as a measure for cOA production. A byproduct of cOA production is the formation of pyrophosphate (PPi), which can be
converted to free phosphate (Pi) by a thermostable pyrophosphatase enzyme [27]. This
Pi can be visualized by a range of colorimetric and fluorometric techniques, such
as the Malachite Green colorimetric technique used in this study. Using this assay, we
show that target RNAs with complementarity to the 5’ handle reduced the production
of cOA to background levels, comparable to using a non-target (NT) target RNA (Figure
2C). Similar results were obtained for the reconstituted TtCmr-46 and TtCmr-40
complexes (Figure S1). We conclude that cOA production, but not target

RNA cleavage, is affected by complementarity between target RNA and the 5’ handle of

crRNA, potentially

detrimental consequences
that cOA production might invoke (e.g. cell death/dormancy) when binding antisense
transcripts from the CRISPR array [12][13].
Next, we tested whether TtCmr utilizes a seed similar the Cascade complexes of type I
systems. Activity assays were performed by incubating the TtCmr complex with target
RNAs containing single mismatch mutations in the first 7 nt of the spacer region of the
crRNA (i.e. the region on the crRNA base pairing with the protospacer) (Figure 2D). The
results showed that RNA targeting was not affected by these mutations, although a
mismatch at position 5 abolished cleavage at the adjacent site, as demonstrated by the
missing
39 nt degradation
product
(Figure
2E). Interestingly
however, cOA production was greatly affected by these mismatches, in particular at
positions 1 and 2 (Figure 2F). Similar results were obtained with the reconstituted TtCmr46 and TtCmr-40 complexes (Figure S2). These results indicate that the seed is either
lacking or located in a different region of the crRNA. However, since base pairing at the
most 5’ region does appear to be critical for cOA production, we designated this segment
as the Cas10-activating region (CAR).
Since the seed is defined as the region on the crRNA that initiates base pairing with its
target, we performed EMSA binding assays with the endogenous TtCmr complex (Figure
S3). To probe for regions crucial for initiating base paring, we used RNA targets with
different mismatching segments (Figure 3A). We observed that targets with mismatches
in the first three segments (nucleotides 1-5, 7-11, and 13-17) did not influence the
binding of the target RNA by the TtCmr complex as the migration was similar to that of
the fully complementary RNA target control (WT). However, mismatches in the fourth
and fifth segments (nucleotides 19-23 and 25-29) substantially affected the
electrophoretic mobility of the TtCmr/crRNA-target RNA tertiary complex, suggesting
a seed region at the 3’ end of the crRNA.
To further investigate the impact of such a uniquely located seed on RNA degradation
and cOA production, we
performed
activity
assays
with
the
endogenous TtCmr complexes using RNA targets containing different mismatching
segments (Figure 3A-C). In agreement with our previous findings, RNA targets with
mismatches in the first segment (S1, nucleotides 1-5) did not interfere with target
degradation, despite skipping one cleavage site downstream of the mismatched segment.
Similarly, mismatching of the segments S2-S5 (nucleotides 7-12, 13-17, 19-23 and 2529) resulted in skipping both the adjacent (up- and downstream) cleavage sites, whereas
cleavage at the other sites was unaffected. Mismatches in segment S6 (nucleotides 3135) had no effect on RNA degradation, other than skipping the upstream cleavage
site (Figure 3B). In contrast, some of the mismatching segments substantially
affected the cOA production (Figure 3C). In agreement with results in Figure 2F, segment
mismatches in the CAR (S1 and S2 region) completely abolished the production of cOA.
Mismatches in segments S3, S5 and S6 had a minor impact on the production of cOA,
whereas a major effect on cOA production was observed with mismatches in
segment S4.
Since the endogenous complex is a mixture of longer and shorter complexes, we
switched to using the TtCmr-46 or TtCmr-40 reconstituted complexes in order to pinpoint
this crucial region more precisely (Figure 3D-I). The TtCmr-46 complex almost
completely mirrored the results obtained with the endogenous complex, with the
exception that mismatches in segment S4 seem to abolish the RNA targeting
activity (Figure 3E). Similarly, mismatches in the CAR (S1 and S2) as well as in
S4 diminish cOA production. However, this essential region appeared to have
shifted one segment in the TtCmr-40 complex, with strict base pairing requirements for
RNA targeting in the third and fourth segments (Figure 3H). Again, effects
on cOA production mirrored these results (Figure 3I). Taken together, these results

crRNA with smaller crRNA sizes (in smaller TtCmr complexes). We propose that together,
these regions act as flexible seed sequences in TtCmr.

Seed region in TtCmr structure is required for concerted structural
rearrangements
To determine the structural basis for the 3’ seed in RNA targeting, we interrogated our
previously determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of TtCmr with both a 46 and
40-nt crRNA (EMD-2898 and -2899, respectively) [23]. In both structures, the 3’ end of
the crRNA is largely exposed, as it is only cradled by the Cmr1/6 head along one side the
RNA strand (Figure 4 A,B). In contrast, the seed region of the crRNA immediately
upstream from the 3’ end (23 to 38 nt) is partially buried and sandwiched between the
Cmr4 and Cmr5 subunits and are less exposed (Figure 4 C,D). The 3’ end of the crRNA is
thus primed for transmitting conformational changes and repositioning Cmr5 subunits
along the complex to facilitate complete target binding. This strongly suggests that
complementarity between the crRNA and target in this region is critical for propagation of
base-pairing along the length of the complex and sensitive to mismatches. Importantly,
because the crRNA is shortened by one segment (6 nucleotides) in TtCmr40 compared to
TtCmr46, the seed shifts towards the 5’ end of the crRNA (17 to 32 nt) in the smaller
complex. Interestingly, recent structures of the S. islandicus Cmr complex also reveal an
exposed 3’ end of the crRNA, despite the decoration of the complex by an additional 26
Cmr7 subunits that are absent in our TtCmr structure [41]. The persistent occurrence of
the exposed 3’ end across Cmr complexes from multiple sources further supports our
model.

SCOPE - a TtCmr-based nucleic acid detection tool
Based on these stringent target RNA requirements, the need to fulfill both the seed and
CAR to initiate cOA production, we hypothesized that type III CRISPR-Cas systems could
be repurposed as a highly sensitive, novel nucleic acid detection tool. To investigate this
possibility, we opted to couple the production of the second messenger to an easy readout. In nature, these cOAs specifically bind to CARF domains of proteins, causing an
allosteric activation of fused nuclease domains. A well-characterized example of such an
enzyme is the cOA-dependent non-specific RNase (TTHB144) of T. thermophilus HB8
[30]. We selected this enzyme to establish a synthetic signal transduction route
consisting of an RNA-targeting TtCmr/crRNA complex that generates cOA molecules,
which trigger the cleavage of a reporter RNA by TTHB144 thereby generating a
detectable fluorescence signal.
After visualizing the first two steps of our detection tool (target RNA binding and cOA
production), we continued by monitoring the third step in the process: activation of a
CARF effector protein, TTHB144. We first performed in vitro activity
assays, using the TtCmr-46 complex, to which we added purified TTHB144 and a 5’ Cy5labelled reporter RNA. We observed defined degradation products of the reporter
RNA only when both the 4.5 target RNA (T) and TTHB144 are present (Figure 5A),
whereas a non-target RNA (NT) did not induce this activity. The segment 4 (S4)
mismatch target RNA (the identified seed region) greatly diminished the intensity of
reporter RNA degradation products. In agreement with earlier results, target
RNAs containing either mismatches in segment 1 (S1) or a single nucleotide mismatch in
the CAR (C1) fully abolished TTHB144 activation, as seen by the lack of reporter RNA
degradation products (Figure 5A). These results show that the target RNA sequence
requirements to activate TTHB144 perfectly match with those of cOA production and
that our setup can discriminate single nucleotide differences.
To generate an easy read-out for our tool, we performed a similar assay, with a
fluorophore-quencher reporter RNA and measured fluorescence in real-time. For this
assay, we used a crRNA that targets the E-gene of the SARS-CoV-2, one of the genes
used in various RT-qPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, validated by FIND [42](Table S1). Using
this setup, a sensitivity of 1 nM target RNA concentration was achieved with a
fluorescence signal detectable within seconds after starting the incubation (Figure 5B).

To enable DNA detection and to enhance the sensitivity of our tool even further, we
included a pre-amplification step akin to those used by other CRISPR-Cas based
diagnostic tools [43]. For this proof of principle, we designed a (RT-)LAMP preamplification step that specifically amplifies the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, simultaneously
adding a T7 promotor to the amplicon that allowed for a subsequent in vitro transcription
step [44] (Table S1, Figure 5C). To determine the limit of detection (LOD) of this 2-step
approach, ten-fold dilutions of the SARS-CoV-2 full synthetic RNA genome
(Twist Bioscience) were used. The inclusion of the LAMP pre-amplification, enhanced the
sensitivity of our tool, reaching sensitivities in the attomolar (10 M) range within
a timespan of ~35 minutes (30 min pre-amplification (1) + 5 min CRISPR detection (2))
(Figure 5D).
To validate our 2-step setup in a more complex reaction environment, we continued by
testing human nasal swab samples, which were collected at an on-site SARS-CoV-2
testing facility. Out of the 81 samples tested, our tool scored 62 of them positively. We
validated these results by comparing them to a PCR-based test (current standard for
SARS-CoV-2 testing) that was performed on the same samples in parallel, which were in
excellent agreement up to a relevant Ct-value of ~39. In addition, 20 samples that were
considered negative by PCR (Ct value not determined, ND), were scored negative by
SCOPE as well (Figure 5E).
Lastly, the thermophilic nature of the type III proteins of our tool offers an
attractive opportunity for a one-pot reaction by combining the LAMP pre-amplification
step with CRISPR detection, as the optimum temperature of the reactions is in the same
range. Due to the maximum temperature tolerance of the Hi-T7 RNA
polymerase (NEB), we performed a one-pot LAMP-CRISPR assay at a temperature of
55°C. The limit of detection was determined at 800 aM, using a synthetic version of
the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach (Figure 5F).

Discussion
Recent advancements in our understanding of type III CRISPR-Cas systems have
highlighted that they have unique mechanistic features compared to other CRISPRCas systems. Examples of this include the requirement for reverse-transcriptase activity
for some type III systems during the adaptation phase [45]–[47] and the potentially
large signaling network mediated by cOA molecules in the interference phase [27]–
[29][32][45]–[47]. Furthermore, type III systems are exceptional in the sense that they
are the only CRISPR-Cas system characterized to date capable of targeting both RNA
(guide dependent) and DNA (collateral). However, the latest classification in type III
CRISPR-Cas systems suggested that not all type III systems are endowed with DNase
activity, due to an inactivated or missing HD domain in Cas10 [50]. This suggests that
RNA is the bona fide target of these systems, as is the case for the type III-B system
(Cmr of S. islandicus [11], and of T. thermophilus presented here.
Yet another unique feature of type III systems is the variable crRNA length with a typical
6 nt periodicity, which, in turn, corresponds to the number of Cas7 subunits that
constitute the backbone of type III-A and type III-B complexes [8][12][18][20][49]–
[51]. Consequently, the cellular population of type III complexes are a heterogenous
mixture of larger and smaller complexes [13][34]. The biological significance of these
observations has remained elusive. Lastly, studies addressing the seed in type III
systems are somewhat conflicting, with one report proposing a complete absence of a
seed [53], whereas other studies report a seed region in either the 5’ [53][54] or 3’
end [55][56] of the crRNA guide. These discrepancies can be explained by the different
methods used to pinpoint certain regions of importance on the crRNA. For instance, readouts that either directly or indirectly look at cOA production, such as phage challenge
experiments or conformational changes in Cas10, will point towards a bigger importance
of the 5’ region. However, studies on the relationship of seed requirements
and cOA production have paved the way for a more thorough and complete investigation
[48]. Here, we dissected the importance of different size-variants of the TtCmr complex
and the different regions on the crRNA by looking at each step from target RNA binding
to CARF protein activation individually. Together, our data resulted in a model presented
in Figure 6.
Firstly, we demonstrated that target RNA binding is initiated by a largely exposed
3’ region on the crRNA, which we designated as the seed region (Figure 3 and Figure
S3). This region coincides with the first region of the crRNA leaving the Cas7/Cas11
backbone that extends to Cmr1 and Cmr6 on the top of the complex. In agreement with
our observations, previous studies showed that target RNA binding in the type III-B
system requires Cmr1 and Cmr6 and that base pairing in a confined region within the 3’
end of the crRNA is crucial for interference [24][55]. We therefore propose that Cmr1
and Cmr6 are involved in the proper positioning of the seed region to initiate base pairing
with its cognate target RNA. The position of Cmr1 and Cmr6 on the crRNA is determined
by the variable 3’ end of the crRNA. Indeed, we observed that shorter complexes (with
the 40 nt crRNA) had a seed region, that was shifted one segment towards the 5’ end
(Figure 3H-I). We conclude that target RNA binding (and cleavage) is governed by a
flexible 3’ located seed region. This is an important difference with the structurallyrelated type I complexes, which harbor a fixed 5’ seed region [38].
Secondly, fulfilling the base pairing requirements in the seed region promotes a
conformational change within the TtCmr complex, opening a channel along the
Cas7/Cas11 backbone wide enough to accommodate further base pairing interactions of
the crRNA with its target RNA (Figure 4,6). Our results show that, in contrast to target
RNA degradation, cOA production is dependent on base pairing with the first seven 5’
nucleotides of the spacer part of the crRNA (with the exception of the nucleotide
at position 6), a region that we designated as the CAR (Cas10 Activating Region). In
accordance with previous work on type I and type III complexes, the nucleotide after

each segment (i.e. every sixth nucleotide) is excluded from base pairing, due to
the thumb-like extension by the Cas7 [23][58].
Lastly, even after fulfilling RNA targeting requirements (starting at the seed, followed by
the CAR) we showed that a final checkpoint ensures that no cOA is produced when
targeting self-RNAs (i.e. anti-sense transcripts from the CRISPR array, which has been
reported to occur at low levels) [59]. Although self-RNAs are bound and cleaved by
TtCmr, the complementarity between the 5’ handle and the corresponding region on the
self-RNA prevented cOA production completely.
Although the biological significance of our findings still awaits further investigation in
vivo, we anticipate that the flexibility of the seed region will complicate MGEs from
escaping CRISPR-Cas targeting by introducing mutations in the protospacer. On one
hand, the ability to recognize heavily mutated MGEs might be beneficial for the host to
provide
a
robust
interference
response
towards MGEs [59][60].
In Marinomonas mediterranea for example, a horizontally acquired type III-B
system was recently shown to effectively bolster the immune response of its native type
I-F systems to cope with phage escapees [62]. On the other hand, this same flexibility
might come at the cost of a higher risk of self-targeting. While incidental binding and
degradation of self-RNAs by itself might not represent a large fitness cost to the host, the
subsequent activation of the Cas10 Palm domain (resulting in the production of the
second messenger that allosterically activates for example promiscuous, sequence nonspecific RNase activity) might have more detrimental consequences [15][16]. This
scenario is in good agreement with our results, showing that activation of the Cas10
Palm domain is indeed only induced when very specific conditions are met (matching
seed, matching CAR and non-matching 5’ handle).
The stringent control of cOA production prompted us to repurpose Type III CRISPR-Cas
systems for the specific detection of nucleic acids. We first developed a
novel pyrophosphatase-based colorimetric assay, which allows for easy quantification
of oligoadenylate production. When combined with appropriate Pi calibration curves, this
method could further be developed for the absolute quantification cOAs or even to
quantify the virus titers in a sample. For signal amplification purposes and to achieve an
easy read-out , we selected TTHB144 - one of the three native cOAactivatable (CARF) proteins present in the genome of T. thermophilus [27][30][63]. We
observed similar trends in target RNA sequence requirements (CAR, and segments
mutants) for activation of the RNase activity of TTHB144 compared to
those governing cOA production (Figure 2 and 3). This shows that the stringent control of
TTHB144 activation could be utilized to make distinctions between target RNAs at a
single base level (Figure 5A, C1 mutant). Next to the sensitivity aspect, our tool was able
to generate a signal rather quickly (detecting 1nM of target RNA within seconds,
Figure 5B), due to the combination of an intrinsic signal amplification step (Cas10
producing a multitude of cOA molecules) and the high ribonuclease activity of TTHB144
[31]. For most diagnostic applications however, a sensitivity of 1nM is not high enough
[43]. Therefore, we adapted a published SARS-CoV-2 LAMP pre-amplification reaction
to bolster the sensitivity of our diagnostic tool even further [44]. Indeed, after testing
this 2-step protocol (Figure 5C) on a SARS-CoV-2 RNA reference genome, we determined
its limit of detection at 40 aM (~<1000 copies total). Validating our test on human nasal
swab samples indicated our test to be 100% accurate up to a Ct value of ~39, which is
higher than most accepted cutoffs for diagnosis [42]. Equally important, we did not
detect any false positives out of the 20 negative samples tested.
Ideally, a true one-pot reaction is preferred to minimize steps and to reduce the risk of
cross-contamination. We therefore investigated the performance of our system in a onepot setup, at a temperature of 55°C (to comply with the upper temperature limit of Hi-T7
polymerase). Despite using non-optimal temperature for the CRISPR detection step, we
were able to achieve a limit of detection of 800 aM using a synthetic gene template

(Figure 5F). We showed the feasibility of the one-pot LAMP CRISPR detection approach
with some room for optimization regarding the longer required incubation time. For
example, the LAMP reaction by itself could be designed and optimized to work more
efficiently at a temperature of 55°C by choosing a different DNA polymerase or change
the primer design.
A couple of CRISPR-based nucleic acids detection platforms have been developed over
the last years, such as DETECTR and SHERLOCK [64][65]. However, SCOPE is the first
Class 1-based CRISPR-Cas nucleic acid detection tool, with a couple of useful
characteristics (flexible seed, stringent CAR, no need for a PAM) that make it an
attractive alternative over the current detection tools. Furthermore, recent bioinformatic
analyses predicted that the repertoire of CARF proteins and the different catalytic
activities associated with them is abundant and highly diverse, offering great
opportunities for the future to utilize these activatable activities as a different readout for
our tool [66].

The ‘open’ seed region located at the 3’ end of the crRNA is more accessible than the upstream regions located

propagating conformational changes and repositioning Cmr5 subunits along the complex upon target binding.

Materials and Methods

Purification of the Cmr complex and individual subunits

A T. thermophilus HB8 strain was created expressing a genomic His-tagged Cm6 subunit.
The (His)6-tagged TtCmr complex purification was achieved via several chromatography
steps as detailed previously (Staals et al., 2013). The purified TtCmr sample was further
concentrated using Vivaspin 20 centrifugal concentrator. For reconstituted complex, each
subunit was individually expressed and purified. All subunits were cloned in
a bicistronic design elements containing expression plasmid under an Isopropyl β-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible T7 promoter and N-terminal Streptavidin tag.
Expression plasmid containing E. coli BL21(DE3) were grown at 37°C until ~OD600=0.6,
after which the culture was cold-shocked on ice for 1h. IPTG was added to a final
concentration of 0.5-1 mM and the culture was incubated at 20°C for 16h. Cells were
harvested and resuspended in Wash Buffer (150mM NaCl, 100mM Tris-HCl, pH 8) and a
Complete protease inhibitor tablet was added (Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication
(25% amplitude 1 sec on, 2 sec off, Bandelin Sonopuls) and spun down at 30.000g for
45 min, subsequent lysate was filter (0.45µm) clarified. A StrepTrap HP (GE) column was
equilibrated using Wash Buffer and the lysate was run over it. Wash Buffer with dDesthiobiotin added to a final concentration of 2.5 mM was used to elute. The elution
fractions were pooled, concentrated and run over a HiLoad® 16/600 Superdex®
75 pg size exclusion chromatography column for further purification. Purification
of TTHB144 was performed in similar fashion.

Reconstitution of TtCmr complexes

For TtCmr46, 3.5 μL crRNA (700 ng) was added to 3.5 μL 1X Cmr buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). Subsequently, the subunits were added to the reaction mixture in
a specific order (Cmr3, Cmr2, Cmr4, Cmr5, Cmr6, Cmr1) to a final concentration of
2.5 μM, 2.5 μM, 10 μM, 7.5 μM, 2.5 μM and 2.5 μM respectively, to make up a total
reaction volume of 20 μL. For TtCmr40 final concentration of subunits was adjusted to
2.5 μM, 2.5 μM, 7.5 μM, 5 μM, 2.5 μM and 2.5 μM respectively. The reaction mixture was
incubated at 65˚C for 30 minutes.

In vitro cleavage activity assays

RNA substrates (listed in Table S1) were either 5’ labelled by T4 polynucleotide kinase
(NEB) and 5’ 32P-γ -ATP, after which they were purified from a denaturing PAGE using
RNA gel elution buffer (0.5M Sodium acetate, 10mM MgCl2, 1mM EDTA and 0.1% SDS)
or ordered with a 5’ Cy5 fluorescent label. In vitro cleavage activity assays were
conducted in TtCmr activity assay buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 10mM
DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 2 mM MgCl2) using the RNA substrate and 62.5nM TtCmr. Unless
stated otherwise, the reaction was incubated at 65°C for 1 hour. RNA loading dye
(containing 95% formamide, dyes left out in case of Cy5 substrates) was added to the
samples after incubation boiled at 95° for 5 minutes. The samples were run on a 20%
denaturing polyacrylamide gel (containing 7M urea) for about 1-4 hours at 15mA or
overnight at a constant of 4mA. The image was visualized using phosphorimaging or
fluorescent gel scanning (IMAGER).

cOA detection assay

The in vitro cOA detection assays were conducted in TtCmr activity assay buffer (20mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 10mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM 30 MgCl2) to
which Cmr-complex (62.5 nM) as well as the RNA substrates (200 nM, listed in Table S1)
were added. The reaction was incubated at 65˚C for 1 hour after which 0.05 units of
pyrophosphatase (ThermoFisher EF0221) was added, followed by an incubation at 25˚C
for 30 minutes. Alternatively, thermostable pyrophosphatase (NEB #M0296) was added
during the 1h incubation at 65˚C. The signal was visualized using the Malachite Green
Phosphate Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich MAK307).

EMSA

EMSAs were performed by incubating 62.5nM TtCmr complex with 5’ Cy5 labeled target
RNAs (Table S1) in Cmr binding buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
DTT, 1 mM EDTA). All reactions were incubated for 20 min at 65°C hour before
electrophoresis on a native 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) at 15mA. The image
was visualized via fluorescent gel scanning (GE Typhoon).

Structural modelling
In

order to model crRNA within our previously determined TtCmr46 and TtCmr40 maps
(EMD-2898 and -2899, respectively), the model of S. islandicus Cmr complex (PD 6S6B)
was fitted as a single rigid body into the TtCmr46 map, and supervised flexible fitting was
performed using Isolde [67]. Maps were visualized using ChimeraX [68].

Human swab sample collection, extraction and qPCR

PCR was conducted in a certified clinical laboratory and all procedures were validated
according to the ISO 15189 standard. Nasopharyngeal swabs were transferred into 3 ml
Universal transport medium. RNA was isolated and purified using the MagC extraction kit
(Seegene) on an automatic nucleic acid extractor Hamilton MicroLAB StartLET (Bonaduz).
SARS-CoV-2 qPCR was performed using the Allplex 19-nCoV multiplex Real-time PCR
assay (Seegene), as described earlier [69]. Results were interpreted with Seegene
Viewer data analysis software. A positive result was defined as amplification of the
Orf1ab SARS-CoV-2 gene.

Nucleic acid detection tool

The target RNA induced activation of TTHB144 assays were performed similarly to the
earlier described in vitro cleavage assays. However, non-labeled target RNA was used
and either a 5’ Cy5 reporter RNA or commercial RNaseAlert was added, as well as 1 µM
purified TTHB144. The LAMP reaction in the 2-step LAMP-CRISPR detection was
performed using the WarmStart® LAMP Kit (NEB #E1700), using primer concentration
described in literature (“Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Using Reverse transcription RTLAMP method,” 2020). A T7 promotor sequence was added to the loop primer to allow for
the subsequent in vitro transcription reaction, which affected its performance only
marginally when compared to the standard Loop primer (data not shown). After preamplification by LAMP, subsequent T7 polymerase transcription will enrich the target
RNA, partly consisting of a template derived region which lies between the Loop primer
and the B2 primer (Figure S4). The subsequent CRISPR detection was performed by
adding
8.75 μL of
CRISPR
Mix
(1X TtCmr Activity
Assay
Buffer,
~62.5 nM TtCmr complex, 500 nM TTHB144, 2 μL NTP Buffer Mix (NEB #E2050), 25 U
Hi-T7 RNA polymerase (NEB #M0658), 250 nM RNaseAlert™ QC System v2
(ThermoFisher) and 8 mM final concentration MgCl). Measurements were made at 1- or
2-minute intervals at 65°C on a Bio-Rad CFX96 qPCR machine (FAM channel). The onepot LAMP-CRISPR reaction was set up as a total reaction volume of 20 μL, according to
the LAMP method described earlier with additions to the earlier described CRISPR Mix
(Modification: 1 μL NTP Buffer Mix (From NEB #E2050, no additional MgCl).
