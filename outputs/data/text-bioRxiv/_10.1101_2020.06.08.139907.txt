Abstract

33

We demonstrate that it is possible to draw direct numerical correlations between virus particles

34

and effective virus-like particle (VLP) derived vaccines through extraction of a Bragg-Williams

35

order parameter from electron microscopy. The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal

36

alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the

37

arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of

38

disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to

39

create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious.

40

Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on

41

differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an

42

approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does

43

not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-

44

scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with

45

pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2

46

virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics.

47

Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature

48

and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-

49

based vaccines to match the corresponding virus. Additionally, utilization of an Ising model plot

50

reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus

51

families.

54

There is considerable interest in reducing the time necessary to develop vaccines, especially in

55

light of the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic stemming from the SARS-CoV-2

56

virus [1]. Here, we demonstrate that what might be best described as a hidden variable ‚Äì when

57

properly recognized ‚Äì identifies a necessary characteristic for any effective vaccine derived from

58

virus-like particles (VLPs). The underlying concept relates to what are known as structural motifs,

59

which are commonly used to understand proteins and their behavioral variations [2]. The notion

60

of a structural motif is, in fact, quite general, and can be employed to describe spatial arrangements

61

of proteins ‚Äì such as what occurs on the surface of a virus particle ‚Äì extending the concept beyond

62

variations within the protein structure itself. The advantages of such an approach can be

63

significant, as it is the disorder and relative composition of viral coat proteins which characterizes

64

such surface configurations that must be preserved in vaccines. Further, the quantifiable degree of

65

disorder can be used in the context of an Ising model to predict the case fatality rate of a new virus,

66

and even dictate the environmental process parameters to monitor for incubation, such as pH and

67

temperature, for potential vaccine components.

Discussion and results

70

A common structural feature of viruses is the outer-most layer of proteins, which are responsible

71

for activities such as binding to host cells and injecting viral genetic material into those cells. The

72

outer proteins (referred to as viral coat proteins) also play an important role in the immune system

73

response, since it is to these proteins that antibodies bind in order to signal the immune system to

74

attack the virus. It is possible to view the configuration of these outer-most proteins from a

75

structural motif perspective, as they are typically six-fold coordinated (although other coordination

76

numbers are possible), with a central protein surrounded by six other proteins to form the basis of

77

a hexagonal-close packed lattice structure (Fig. 1). There are numerous possible permutations of

78

six-fold motifs. In the case of a virus with two major viral coat proteins (which, to avoid loss of

79

generality, we will refer to as ÔÅ° and ÔÅ¢) as depicted in Fig. 1A, there are 20 distinct six-fold motifs.

80

The number of each motif occurring in a particular specimen is directly determined by the viral

81

coat protein composition and by the degree of disorder characterizing the virus surface, the latter

82

of which can be quantified through a Bragg-Williams type order parameter S [6,7]. A fully ordered

83

surface, corresponding to a unity value of S, consists of only a single structural (base) motif,

84

illustrated in Fig. 1 a, b and c for the cases of six-fold coordinated viruses with two and three major

85

viral coat proteins, respectively. In contrast, a completely disordered protein configuration

86

corresponds to a value of S = 0, and can have a large set of structural motifs representing variations

87

of the base motif.

96
97

One of the two major factors that determine the occurrence probability of the different motifs is

98

the ordering of the viral coat proteins on the outer surface of the virion. To proceed with developing

99

a quantifiable measure of the degree of ordering, we first define the perfectly ordered (S = 1) case.

100

This is accomplished by selecting the base motif ‚Äì the structural motif which contains equal

101

numbers of both viral coat proteins, identified in Fig. 1B (note that for this case the outer viral coat

102

proteins of the motif only contribute ¬Ω to the viral coat protein count since they are shared by

103

neighboring motifs). Using the base motif as a reference, the degree of ordering can be quantified

104

through the Bragg-Williams long range order parameter S, where S = rÔÅ° + rÔÅ¢ ‚Äì 1. Here, rÔÅ° is the

105

fraction of ÔÅ° viral coat proteins on ÔÅ°-sites, and rÔÅ¢ is the percentage of ÔÅ¢ viral coat proteins on ÔÅ¢-

106

sites, respectively (from the perspective of the reference motif); it is straightforward to extend the

107

approach for situations involving more than two distinct viral coat proteins. In material systems

108

such as binary metal alloys or semiconductors, the order parameter historically has been measured

109

through techniques such as x-ray diffraction [7]. Recently, we have extended the determination of

110

S to include techniques such as Raman spectroscopy [8] and electron microscopy [9, 10], the latter

111

of which we have used to calculate the order parameter of virions from transmission electron

112

microscopy (TEM) images.

113
114

The other major factor that determines the occurrence probability of different motifs is the relative

115

composition of the viral coat proteins. For the case of two such proteins, we define composition

116

as x = (ùëÅùõº + ùëÅùõΩ), where NÔÅ° and N ÔÅ¢ represent the total number of each protein, respectively, and can

117

be measured through techniques such as sodium dodecyl sulfate‚Äìpolyacrylamide gel

118

electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) [11]. The percentage of different motifs that will occur on the surface

119

of the virion can be calculated based on the composition x and the order parameter S. Figure 2

120

shows the motif percentages for a fully disordered surface over the full range of possible

121

compositions of a two-viral coat protein, six-fold coordinated motif. As illustrated in Fig. 2 a, the

122

base motif and its related variations are much more likely to form at balanced compositions, i.e.,

123

near x = 0.5. At the extreme values of x, the motifs dominated by a single viral coat protein (ÔÅ¢7 and

124

ÔÅ°7 motifs) become much more likely to form, and specific types of single viral coat protein

125

dominated motifs (such as the ÔÅ°2ÔÅ¢5 or ÔÅ°6ÔÅ¢1 motifs) become more likely with shifts towards the

126

extreme ranges of the composition, as can be seen in Fig. 2 b. We note that depending on the

127

composition, there may be physically inaccessible values of S; the maximum S value for x ‚â§ 0.5 is

128

2x, and 2(1- x) for x ‚â• 0.5.

variations; (b) Representative selection of single-viral coat protein dominated motifs. The number

134
135

Since viral coat proteins play a defining role in the interactions between viruses, host cells, and

136

antibodies, and the viral coat protein structural motifs play a significant role in these interactions,

137

we propose that when developing vaccines starting with VLPs, it is important to match the motif

138

composition of the intended virus. Counting the motifs of a given virus or VLP is impractical,

139

however, and so taking advantage of the correlation between the numerical occurrence of specific

140

motifs and the order parameter for known viral coat protein composition provides a viable

141

alternative. Figure 3 compares order parameter values extracted from TEM images for five distinct

142

viruses to the corresponding experimentally determined order parameters for VLPs used to create

143

vaccines. The VLPs for the two influenza viruses and for the Zika virus have order parameters

144

very close to their corresponding viruses, and showed promising results for developing immune

145

responses. The VLP shown for HPV16 corresponds to Gardisil¬Æ9, one of two commercially

146

available vaccines. Conversely, for the example HIV vaccine in Fig. 3, the VLP has an order

147

parameter much higher than that of the virus. A possible explanation for the difficulty in

148

developing an effective HIV vaccine [21,22] could therefore be that current vaccines and even

149

potential vaccines, such as yeast based VLPs [23] (the S2 of one such yeast-based VLP is shown

150

in Fig. 3), do not properly match the order parameter and composition [24] of the viral coat protein

151

surface of the HIV virus. This suggests that for a vaccine to be effective, the order parameter of

152

any VLP used in its creation should closely match that of the corresponding virus.

158
159

When developing VLPs (or any vaccine), the composition of the viral coat proteins can be

160

controlled by gene manipulation. However, the degree of disorder which characterizes the viral

161

coat protein surface of a virus is influenced by conditions under which the virion matures; for

162

example, the temperature or pH of the growth environment. This is observed in the plot of Fig. 4,

163

which shows the variation of the order parameter in Dengue and influenza viruses with varying

164

incubation temperatures in a neutral pH environment. The readily apparent linear variation of the

165

square of the order parameter with temperature is indicative of a Landau second-order phase

166

transition present in ordered-disordered systems [25]. Additionally, the inset shows the influence

167

of pH on the ordering of the Dengue virus, which follows a similar linear trend as the temperature.

173
174

Further insight into viruses can be achieved by applying the classic Ising model (31) to the viral

175

coat proteins, where the ÔÅ° viral coat protein is assigned a spin ‚Äúup‚Äù and the ÔÅ¢ viral coat protein

176

assigned a spin ‚Äúdown.‚Äù Such an approach allows us to cast a physical or system property P

177

(provided it is dominated by the action of both viral coat proteins) as ùëÉ(ùëÜ,ùë•) =

178

[ùëÉ(ùëÜ = 1, 0.5) ‚Äí ùëÉ(ùëÜ = 0,ùë•)]ùëÜ2 + ùëÉ(ùëÜ = 0,ùë•). The Ising model equation therefore predicts a

179

linear correlation of the property to the square of the order parameter, or S2. Applying the model

180

to four different virus families (henipaviruses, flaviviruses, influenza viruses and coronaviruses)

181

with the case fatality rate of the virus as the system property, yields remarkable agreement as

182

illustrated in Fig. 5A. It suggests, among other things, that such an approach enables a prediction

183

of the severity of any new virus provided that other members of the same family are well

184

documented. A possible explanation for the linear trends observed in Fig. 5A can be found from

185

within a motif perspective, as we observe that for all four families, as the disorder increases, the

186

fatality rate also increases. Increasing disorder will cause more single-type viral coat protein motifs

187

to form, for example, more hemagglutinin-heavy motifs in the case of influenza, envelope-heavy

188

motifs in flaviviruses, and spike-heavy motifs in coronaviruses. These viral coat proteins are

189

responsible for binding to the hosts cells, so a higher number of such motifs likely translates into

190

a higher probability of the virions successfully attaching and subsequently infecting host cells, and

191

a corresponding higher case fatality rate seen in each family with decreasing S2 values. It is also

192

interesting to note that while all of the available experimental data points on the Ising model plot

193

in Fig. 5A have a positive value for case fatality rate, extrapolating the lines to the fully ordered

194

(S = 1) case yields negative values. Far from being unphysical, we suggest that such values can be

195

explained by considering that the opposite to fatality would be a measure of symbiosis enabled by

196

the virus. An example that supports this interpretation comes from studies of mitochondria (in

197

which the equivalent to viral coat proteins would be the types of porins on its outer surface) and

198

corresponding diseases. As shown in Fig 5B, healthy mitochondria that exist in cells have very

199

high S2 values, while mitochondria that are responsible for diseases have a lower S2 value.

204

mitochondria. Data extracted for chondrocyte mitochondria from [54] and for C. elegans

205

206
207

The motif-based disorder perspective also allows for another interesting observation. It is well-

208

known that the 1918 H1N1 virus was deadlier during the second wave in the autumn than during

209

the initial wave of infections during the spring [56]. It is generally held that this second deadlier

210

wave was due to the virus mutating, which can be understood through the lens of motifs and the

211

Ising model. From Fig. 4, we see that increasing the incubation temperature of a virus decreases

212

its order parameter, and from Fig 5, we can see that in general (and specifically for influenza

213

viruses) decreasing S2 of a given virus increases the mortality rate. Thus, in the case of the 1918

214

H1N1 pandemic, a possible explanation for the higher autumnal death toll is that the warmer

215

weather created higher incubation temperatures for the virus that caused its order parameter to

216

decrease, leading to an increase in associated mortality rate. Support for such a conclusion can be

217

found in the study by Harding et al., for example, who reported a 0.2 ¬∞C increase in the core body

218

temperature from the winter to summer months [57]. Using the linear trends for influenza from

219

Fig. 4, such an incubation temperature change would cause a decrease of 0.0053 in the squared

220

order parameter of the virus, which in turn would correspond to an increase of 0.64 percentage

221

points in the case fatality rate.

222
223

Conclusion

224

In conclusion, we present a methodology for viewing viruses through the lens of viral coat protein

225

motifs, specifically that disorder and relative fractional composition of viral coat proteins

226

determine the range of viral coat protein structural motifs present on viruses and VLPs used in

227

vaccines. We present a method for quantizing the degree the disorder through an order parameter,

228

S, which can be measured using electron microscopy images. Additionally, combining a

229

quantitative measure of disorder with an Ising model allows for deeper insights into the root cause

230

for virus properties in a population, as well as guidance in terms of achieving the characteristics

231

needed for vaccines.

237

parameter of a sample may also be calculated from transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

238

images. In such images, the pixel intensity is less in disordered regions than in ordered regions;

239

this stems from the fact that electrons are incoherently scattered by disordered stacks of atoms as

240

opposed to the coherent diÔ¨Äraction that occurs from well-ordered stacks of atoms [9]. The S2 value

241

(square of the order parameter) of a sample is equal to the percentage of area corresponding to

242

bright regions. The bright and dark areas corresponding to the ordered and disordered regions can

243

be more easily determined and measured by thresholding the image near the average pixel intensity

244

of the bright regions. The Supplemental Materials section provides evidence for the equivalence

245

between the methods of calculating S2 from TEM and Raman spectroscopy, specifically surface-

246

enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).
