ABSTRACT

33

Coronaviruses (CoVs) stand out for their large RNA genome and complex RNA-

34

synthesizing machinery comprising 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The bifunctional

35

nsp14 contains an N-terminal 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-

36

methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain. While the latter presumably operates during

37

viral mRNA capping, ExoN is thought to mediate proofreading during genome

38

replication. In line with such a role, ExoN-knockout mutants of mouse hepatitis virus

39

(MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were

40

previously found to have a crippled but viable hypermutation phenotype. Remarkably,

41

using an identical reverse genetics approach, an extensive mutagenesis study

42

revealed the corresponding ExoN-knockout mutants of another betacoronavirus,

43

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), to be non-viable. This is

44

in agreement with observations previously made for alpha- and gammacoronaviruses.

45

Only a single MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant could be recovered, likely because

46

the introduced D191E substitution is highly conservative in nature. For 11 other MERS-

47

CoV ExoN active site mutants, not a trace of RNA synthesis could be detected, unless

48

– in some cases – reversion had first occurred. Subsequently, we expressed and

49

purified recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and established in vitro assays for both its

50

ExoN and N7-MTase activities. All ExoN knockout mutations that were lethal when

51

tested via reverse genetics were found to severely decrease ExoN activity, while not

52

affecting N7-MTase activity. Our study thus reveals an additional function for MERS-

53

CoV nsp14 ExoN, which apparently is critical for primary viral RNA synthesis, thus

54

differentiating it from the proofreading activity thought to boost long-term replication

55

fidelity in MHV and SARS-CoV.

IMPORTANCE

58

The bifunctional nsp14 subunit of the coronavirus replicase contains 3’-to-5’

59

exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domains. For the

60

betacoronaviruses MHV and SARS-CoV, the ExoN domain was reported to promote

61

the fidelity of genome replication, presumably by mediating some form of proofreading.

62

For these viruses, ExoN knockout mutants are alive while displaying an increased

63

mutation frequency. Strikingly, we now established that the equivalent knockout

64

mutants of MERS-CoV ExoN are non-viable and completely deficient in RNA

65

synthesis, thus revealing an additional and more critical function of ExoN in coronavirus

66

replication. Both enzymatic activities of (recombinant) MERS-CoV nsp14 were

67

evaluated using newly developed in vitro assays that can be used to characterize these

68

key replicative enzymes in more detail and explore their potential as target for antiviral

69

drug development.

INTRODUCTION

73

RNA viruses commonly exhibit high mutation rates, a feature attributed to the relatively

74

poor fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the fact that

75

nucleotide incorporation errors go uncorrected. This lack of proofreading contributes

76

to the generation of ‘quasispecies’ populations, clouds of genome sequence variants

77

that are subject to continuous natural selection (1-3). On the one hand, their genetic

78

heterogeneity allows RNA viruses to rapidly adapt to changing circumstances, in order

79

to overcome environmental challenges such as host switching, antiviral drug treatment,

80

or host immune responses (4, 5). On the other hand, the accumulation of an excessive

81

number of deleterious mutations can result in ‘error catastrophe’ and, consequently, in

82

the extinction of a viral species (6-8). In order to balance these opposing principles,

83

RNA viruses are thought to operate close to their so-called ‘error threshold’, while

84

balancing the interdependent parameters of replication fidelity, genome size, and

85

genome complexity (9, 10). This interplay is thought to have restricted the expansion

86

of RNA virus genome size, which is below 15 kilobases (kb) for most RNA virus families

87

(10-12).

88

The largest RNA virus genomes currently known are found in the order Nidovirales,

89

which includes the coronavirus (CoV) family and also the recently discovered planarian

90

secretory cell nidovirus (PSCNV; (12, 13)), which has the largest RNA genome

91

identified thus far (41.1 kb). One of the molecular mechanisms potentially driving the

92

unprecedented expansion of nidovirus genomes emerged about 17 years ago, during

93

the in-depth bioinformatics analysis of the genome and proteome of the severe acute

94

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). During this analysis, Alexander

95

Gorbalenya and colleagues identified a putative 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease (ExoN)

96

signature sequence in the N-terminal domain of nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.162529; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

97

subunit of the large replicase polyprotein encoded by CoVs and related large-genome

98

nidoviruses. Strikingly, this ExoN domain was found to be lacking in the replicases of

99

nidoviruses with small(er) genomes (specifically, arteriviruses), and therefore it was

100

proposed that the enzyme may provide a form of ‘proofreading activity’ that could have

101

promoted the expansion of large nidoviral genomes to their current size (10-12, 14).

102

Comparative sequence analysis with cellular homologs classified the nidoviral/CoV

103

ExoN domain as a member of the superfamily of DEDDh exonucleases, which also

104

includes the proofreading domains of many DNA polymerases as well as other

105

eukaryotic and prokaryotic exonucleases (15). These enzymes catalyze the excision

106

of nucleoside monophosphates from nucleic acids in the 3’-to-5’ direction, using a

107

mechanism that depends on two divalent metal ions and a reactive water molecule

108

(16-18). Five conserved active site residues arranged in three canonical motifs (I, II

109

and III; Fig. 1) orchestrate ExoN activity (14, 19-21). Additionally, the domain

110

incorporates two zinc finger (ZF) motifs (10), ZF1 and ZF2 (Fig. 1), that were

111

hypothesized to contribute to the structural stability and catalytic activity of ExoN,

112

respectively (20).

113

The predicted 3’-to-5’ exoribonuclease activity of the CoV ExoN domain was first

114

confirmed in vitro, in biochemical assays using recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 and

115

different synthetic RNA substrates (19). Originally, residues D90/E92 (motif I), D243

116

(motif II), and D273 (motif III) were identified as putative active site residues of SARS-

117

CoV nsp14 (14, 19). However, the SARS-CoV nsp14 crystal structure revealed E191

118

rather than D243 to be the acidic active residue in Motif II, demonstrating that ExoN is

119

in fact a DEEDh enzyme (20). By using reverse genetics of the alphacoronavirus

120

human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), Minskaia et al. demonstrated that inactivation

121

of the ExoN active site results in failure to recover infectious viral progeny (19).

122

Interestingly, a quite different phenotype was described for the corresponding ExoN-

123

knockout mutants of two betacoronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-

124

CoV. While ExoN inactivation decreased replication fidelity in these viruses, conferring

125

a ‘mutator phenotype’, the mutants were viable, both in cell culture (22, 23) and in

126

animal models (24). These findings suggested that ExoN may indeed be part of an

127

error correction mechanism. Subsequently, the ability of ExoN to excise 3’-terminal

128

mismatched nucleotides from a double-stranded (ds) RNA substrate was

129

demonstrated in vitro using recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 (25). Furthermore, this

130

activity was shown to be strongly enhanced (up to 35-fold) by the presence of nsp10,

131

a small upstream subunit of the CoV replicase (26). The two subunits were proposed

132

to operate, together with the nsp12-RdRp, in repairing mismatches that may be

133

introduced during CoV RNA synthesis (21, 27). In cell culture, MHV and SARS-CoV

134

mutants lacking ExoN activity exhibit increased sensitivity to mutagenic agents like 5-

135

fluoracil (5-FU), compounds to which the wild-type virus is relatively resistant (28, 29).

136

Recently, ExoN activity was also implicated in CoV RNA recombination, as an MHV

137

ExoN knockout mutant exhibited altered recombination patterns, possibly reflecting its

138

involvement in other activities than error correction during CoV replication and

139

subgenomic mRNA synthesis (30). Outside the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the

140

only other RNA viruses known to employ an ExoN domain, which is part of the

141

arenavirus nucleoprotein and has been implicated in fidelity control (31) and/or immune

142

evasion, the latter by degrading viral dsRNA (32, 33). Based on results obtained with

143

TGEV and MHV ExoN knockout mutants, also the CoV ExoN activity was suggested

144

to counteract innate responses (34, 35).

145

In the meantime, CoV nsp14 was proven to be a bifunctional protein by the discovery

146

of an (N7-guanine)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity in its C-terminal domain

147

(36)(Fig. 1). This enzymatic activity was further corroborated in vitro, using biochemical

148

assays with purified recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14. The enzyme was found capable

149

of methylating cap analogues or GTP substrates, in the presence of S-adenosyl

150

methionine (SAM) as methyl donor (36, 37). The N7-MTase was postulated to be a

151

key factor for equipping CoV mRNAs with a functional 5’-terminal cap structure, as N7-

152

methylation is essential for cap recognition by the cellular translation machinery (25).

153

Although, the characterization of the nsp14 N7-MTase active site and reaction

154

mechanism was not completed, alanine scanning mutagenesis and in vitro assays with

155

nsp14 highlighted several key residues (Fig. 1)(36, 38, 39). Moreover, crystal

156

structures of SARS-CoV nsp14 in complex with its nsp10 co-factor (PDB entries 5C8U

157

and 5NFY) revealed several unique structural and functional features (Ma et al., 2015;

158

Ferron et al., 2018). These combined structural and biochemical studies confirmed that

159

the two enzymatic domains of nsp14 are functionally distinct (36) and physically

160

independent (20, 21). Still, the two activities are structurally intertwined, as it seems

161

that the N7-MTase activity depends on the integrity of the N-terminal ExoN domain,

162

whereas the flexibility of the protein is modulated by a hinge region connecting the two

163

domains (21).

164

Coronaviruses are abundantly present in mammalian reservoir species, including

165

bats, and pose a continuous zoonotic threat (40-43). To date, seven CoVs that can

166

infect humans have been identified, and among these the severe acute respiratory

167

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently causing an unprecedented

168

pandemic outbreak. The previous CoV to emerge, in 2012, was the Middle East

169

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (44). Due to zoonotic transfer from

170

dromedary camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission, MERS-CoV still

171

continues to circulate and cause serious human disease, primarily in the Arabian

172

Peninsula (45). Occasional spread to other countries has also occurred, including an

173

outbreak with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea in 2015 (46-48). Like SARS-

174

CoV/SARS-CoV2 and MHV, MERS-CoV is classified as a member of the

175

betacoronavirus genus, although it belongs to a different lineage (subgenus) of that

176

cluster (49, 50). The current lack of approved therapeutics and vaccines to prevent or

177

treat CoV infections, as well as the general threat posed by emerging CoVs,

178

necessitates the further in-depth characterization of CoV replication and replicative

179

enzymes. In this context, the quite different phenotypes described for ExoN knockout

180

mutants of other CoVs (see above) prompted us to study the importance of this enzyme

181

for MERS-CoV replication. To this end, using both reverse genetics and biochemical

182

assays with recombinant nsp14, we engaged in an extensive site-directed

183

mutagenesis study, targeting all active site residues of the MERS-CoV ExoN domain.

184

Strikingly, in contrast to what was observed for other betacoronaviruses, our studies

185

revealed that ExoN inactivation renders MERS-CoV RNA synthesis undetectable and

186

results in failure to recover viable virus progeny. Our biochemical evaluation of nsp14

187

mutants suggests that this is not caused by inadvertent side-effects of ExoN

188

inactivation on N7-MTase activity. Our combined data suggest that MERS-CoV ExoN

189

and/or nsp14 play a more direct and fundamental role in CoV RNA synthesis than

190

merely safeguarding the long-term fidelity of replication, and can be considered a

191

prominent target for the development of antiviral drugs.

RESULTS

194
195

ExoN inactivation is lethal for MERS-CoV

196

Previous studies into CoV ExoN function involved its biochemical characterization

197

(based almost exclusively on the SARS-CoV version of the enzyme) and the

198

phenotypic analysis of (predicted) ExoN knockout virus mutants, generated using

199

reverse genetics approaches. The latter studies yielded replication-incompetent ExoN

200

knockout mutants for the alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E (19) and transmissible

201

gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (34). However, the equivalent mutants of the

202

betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MHV-A59 were somewhat crippled but clearly

203

viable, while displaying a 15- to 20-fold increased mutation rate (Eckerle, Lu et al. 2007,

204

Eckerle, Becker et al. 2010). An alignment of CoV nsp14 amino acid sequences is

205

presented in Fig. 1, including SARS-CoV-2, which emerged during the course of this

206

project. It highlights the key motifs/residues of the two enzymatic domains of nsp14,

207

as well as other structural elements, like the nsp10 binding site, the hinge region

208

connecting the ExoN and N7-MTase domains, and three previously identified zinc

209

finger domains (20, 21). The alignment also illustrates the generally high degree of

210

nsp14 sequence conservation across different CoV (sub)genera.

211

In the present study, we targeted all five predicted active site residues of the MERS-

212

CoV ExoN domain (D90, E92, E191, D273, and H268) by replacing them with alanine

213

as well as more conservative substitutions (D to E or Q; E to D or Q). This yielded a

214

total of 14 ExoN active site mutants (Fig. 2A), including the D90A/E92A motif-I double

215

mutant (DM) that was frequently used in studies of the viable ExoN knockout mutants

216

for MHV and SARS-CoV. A BAC-based MERS-CoV reverse genetics system (51, 52),

217

based on the sequence of the EMC/2012 isolate of MERS-CoV (53), served as the

218

starting point to evaluate our ExoN mutants by transfection of full-length RNA that was

219

obtained by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase.

220

Transcripts were electroporated into BHK-21 cells, which lack the DPP4 receptor

221

required for natural MERS-CoV infection (Chan, Chan et al. 2013, Raj, Mou et al. 2013)

222

but are commonly used to launch engineered CoV mutants because of their excellent

223

survival of the electroporation procedure (19, 22, 23, 34, 51, 54). As BHK-21 cells have

224

a severely compromised innate immune response (55), they would seem an

225

appropriate cell line to launch ExoN knockout mutants also in case the enzyme would

226

be needed to counter innate immunity (Becares, Pascual-Iglesias et al. 2016, Case, Li

227

et al. 2018). To amplify any progeny virus released, transfected BHK-21 cells were

228

mixed with either innate immune-deficient (Vero) or -competent (HuH7) cells, which

229

both are naturally susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.

230

In stark contrast to what was previously described for MHV and SARS-CoV,

231

mutagenesis of ExoN active site residues was found to fully abrogate MERS-CoV

232

replication. When transfected cell cultures were analyzed using immunofluorescence

233

microscopy at 2 days post transfection (d p.t.), abundant signal was always observed

234

for wild-type MERS-CoV, but no sign of virus replication was observed for 13 out of 14

235

mutants tested (Fig. 2), regardless whether Vero or HUH7 cells were used for

236

propagation of recombinant virus. Furthermore, infectious progeny was not detected

237

when transfected cell culture supernatants were analyzed in plaque assays (Fig. 2 and

238

data not shown). The single exception was the mutant carrying the conservative E191D

239

replacement in ExoN motif II (Fig. 1), which was alive but somewhat crippled, as will

240

be discussed in more detail below. These results were consistent across a large

241

number of independent repeats (>10 for several of the mutants), performed with RNA

242

transcribed from independently engineered (and fully sequenced) duplicate full-length

243

cDNA clones. The non-viable phenotype of MERS-CoV ExoN mutants in both cell

244

types suggests that innate immune responses did not influence the outcome of these

245

experiments.

246
247

ExoN inactivation abrogates MERS-CoV RNA synthesis

248

For a selection of MERS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants, intracellular RNA was isolated

249

from transfected cell cultures after 48 h and analyzed by in-gel hybridization and RT-

250

PCR to more rigorously verify the lack of viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 3). In this analysis,

251

a non-viable MERS-CoV mutant with an in-frame 100-aa deletion in the nsp12-RdRp

252

domain was used as a negative control (NC) for viral RNA synthesis, in order to assess

253

and correct for the detection of any residual full-length RNA transcript that might still

254

be present at this timepoint after transfection. Upon direct in-gel hybridization analysis

255

using a 32P-labeled probe recognizing the 3’ end of all viral mRNAs, the characteristic

256

nested set of MERS-CoV transcripts could only be detected for the E191D mutant and

257

the wt control virus (Fig. 3). Even after a 28-day exposure of the phosphor imager

258

screen (data not shown), signal could not be detected for any of the other mutants.

259

The lack of MERS-CoV-specific RNA synthesis was further analyzed using RT-PCR

260

assays specifically detecting genomic RNA or subgenomic mRNA3. RNA

261

accumulation was evaluated at 1 and 2 d p.t. for seven selected ExoN active site

262

mutants (D90A, D90E, E191A, E191D, D273A, H268A, DM) using samples from two

263

independent experiments both comprising duplicate transfections for each mutant.

264

Again, MERS-CoV-specific genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis was only

265

detected for the E191D mutant and the wt virus control (data not shown). For all other

266

mutants, the RT-PCR assays yielded Ct values equivalent to those obtained for

267

samples from mock-infected cells and the replication-deficient NC mutant. In

268

conclusion, with the exception of E191D (see below), all our engineered ExoN active

269

site mutations abrogated viral RNA synthesis completely, suggesting that in the case

270

of MERS-CoV the enzyme is indispensable for basic replication in cell culture.

274

Among our ExoN active site mutants, only the E191D mutant yielded viable progeny

275

(Fig. 2). The mutant appeared to be genetically stable as the substitution was

276

preserved upon multiple consecutive passages in HuH7 or Vero cells (data not shown).

277

Interestingly, the E191D mutation transforms the DEEDh catalytic motif into the

278

DEDDh motif that is characteristic for members of the exonuclease family to which the

279

CoV ExoN belongs (56). In fact, when comparing ExoN sequences from different

280

nidovirus taxa (14, 19) the equivalent of E191 alternates between E and D (57), in line

281

with the observation that this mutation is tolerated in MERS-CoV ExoN.

282

To characterize the E191D mutant in more detail, its replication and fitness in cell

283

culture were analyzed. Full-length genome sequencing of passage 2 of the E191D

284

mutant virus revealed that it had acquired two other mutations when compared with

285

the recombinant wt control: a synonymous mutation in the nsp2-coding region (U→C

286

at nt position 2,315) and a non-synonymous mutation (C→A at nt position 6,541)

287

specifying an A1235D substitution in the betacoronavirus-specific marker (βSM)

288

domain of nsp3, which has been predicted to be a non-enzymatic domain (58) and is

289

absent in alpha- and delta-coronaviruses (59, 60). Thus, we assumed that any

290

changes in viral replication were likely caused by the E191D mutation in nsp14 ExoN.

291

The same virus stock was used to assess growth kinetics in HuH7 cells (Fig. 4B) and

292

Vero cells (Fig. 4A), which were found to be very similar for wt and mutant virus. Still,

293

the E191D mutant was found to be somewhat crippled, yielding smaller plaque sizes

294

and somewhat lower progeny titers in HuH7 cells (Fig. 4 B-C), but not in Vero cells

295

(Fig. 4A).

296

We next examined the sensitivity of E191D and wt virus to the mutagenic agent 5-

297

FU, which intracellularly is converted into a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated

298

into viral RNA (61, 62). Previously, MHV and SARS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants were

299

found to exhibit increased sensitivity to 5-FU treatment, in particular in multi-cycle

300

experiments, which was attributed to a higher mutation frequency in the absence of

301

ExoN-driven error correction (28). We employed this same assay to assess the

302

phenotype of the E191D mutant in more detail, by performing plaque assays in HuH7

303

cells in the presence of increasing 5-FU concentrations (Fig. 4C) and by growing

304

mutant and wt virus in the presence of increasing 5-FU concentrations (Fig. 4D). No

305

cytotoxicity was observed in HuH7 cells following treatment with up to 400 µM 5-FU

306

(data not shown).

307

Plaque assays in HuH7 cells were performed for 3 days, using a standard inoculum

308

of 30 p.f.u. and an increasing amount of 5-FU in the overlay. Similar dose-dependent

309

reductions of plaque size were observed for E191D and wt virus, with E191D plaques

310

being barely visible upon treatment with 200 µM 5-FU (Fig. 4C). In an alternative

311

experiment, Huh7 cells were infected with an m.o.i. of 1 and treated with an increasing

312

5-FU dose for 30 h, after which progeny virus titers were determined by regular plaque

313

assay. Again, both viruses exhibited a similar concentration-dependent decrease of

314

replication (Fig. 4D), although the E191D mutant appeared to be somewhat more

315

sensitive to the mutagenic agent, yielding ~1-log lower progeny titers than wt virus

316

upon treatment with 5-FU concentrations between 100 and 400 µM. These

317

experiments demonstrated thatE191D and wt MERS-CoV are comparably sensitive to

5-FU treatment, suggesting that ExoN functionality is not strongly affected by the

319

E191D substitution.

320
321

ExoN zinc finger motifs are important for viral replication

322

Studies addressing the structural biology and biochemistry of SARS-CoV nsp14

323

indicated that the two ZF motifs within the ExoN domain contribute to either its

324

structural stability (ZF1) or to catalytic activity (ZF2) (20, 21). Moreover, mutagenesis

325

studies of the MHV and TGEV ZF1 domain supported their importance for viral

326

replication in cell culture (34, 54). To study the impact of similar mutations on MERS-

327

CoV replication, the nsp14 ZF1 and ZF2 domains were targeted with two mutations

328

each and their impact on virus viability was evaluated as described above. Two ZF1

329

residues (C210 and H229) were mutated from H to C or vice versa, which could

330

theoretically preserve the zinc-coordinating properties (63, 64). Two residues of the

331

non-classical ZF2 motif were also substituted (C261A and H264R) to evaluate the

332

same ZF mutations previously analyzed by Ma et al., leading to disruption of ExoN

333

activity in vitro (20).

334

The four ZF virus mutants were launched as described above, after which a low

335

level of replication could be observed only for the H229C ZF1 mutant, for which the 2

336

d p.t. harvest yielded very small plaques and low progeny titers (Fig. 2B). For this

337

mutant, RNA synthesis could not be detected by hybridization analysis (Fig. 3), but

338

synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNA (mRNA3) was detected by RT-PCR in

339

intracellular RNA samples harvested at 2 d p.t. (data not shown). A 6 d p.t. harvest

340

was used for full genome sequencing by NGS, which confirmed the presence of the

341

engineered nsp14 mutation in addition to the appearance of some minor genetic

342

variants (point mutations representing less than 15% of the total population) in different

343

regions of the genome, including the ORF1a domain encoding for nsp3, nsp6, nsp8,

344

and nsp9. Taken together, our observations defined the severely crippled phenotype

345

of the H229C mutant. In combination with the fact that the other ZF mutations (C210H

346

in ZF1, and C261A and H264R in ZF2) abolished all detectable MERS-CoV replication,

347

our study establishes the importance of both ExoN ZF motifs for MERS-CoV viability.

348
349

Development of a MERS-CoV ExoN activity assay using recombinant nsp14

350

In order to assess the impact of mutations on nsp14’s enzymatic activities, we set out

351

to purify recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 and develop an in vitro ExoN assay. Thus far,

352

such an assay had only been described for the equivalent SARS-CoV protein (19, 20,

353

26, 65). Wild-type and mutant MERS-CoV nsp14 proteins carrying an N-terminal His-

354

tag were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS. Proteins were purified by

355

immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by size exclusion

356

chromatography. Upon SDS-PAGE, the purified MERS-CoV nsp14 was consistently

357

detected as a doublet (with the lower band being most abundant), migrating at the

358

expected molecular mass of ~55 kDa (Fig. 5). As a positive control, we purified SARS-

359

CoV nsp14 (26) and used it during optimization of the enzymatic assays for MERS-

360

CoV nsp14. The substrate used for ExoN activity assays was a 5’-32P-labeled 22-

361

nucleotide (nt) long synthetic RNA, as previously used in similar assays with SARS-

362

CoV nsp14 (referred to as oligonucleotide H4 in (26)). Nucleotides 5-22 of this

363

substrate are predicted to form a hairpin with a stem consisting of seven G-C base

364

pairs and a loop of 4 A’s (26), while the remaining 4 nucleotides form a 5’-terminal

365

single-stranded tail.

366

Previously, the ExoN activity of SARS-CoV nsp14 was found to be dramatically

367

stimulated by the addition of nsp10 as co-factor (26). Consequently, we also expressed

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.162529; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

368

and purified MERS-CoV nsp10 and optimized the ExoN assay by testing different

369

molar ratios between nsp14 and nsp10 (Fig. 6A, left-hand side), different nsp14

370

concentrations (Fig. 6B, left-hand side), and by different incubation times (Fig. 7, left-

371

hand side). MERS-CoV nsp14 ExoN activity was found to be stimulated by nsp10 in a

372

dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), while nsp10 did not exhibit any nuclease activity by

373

itself (Fig. 6B, nsp10 lane). The full-length substrate is more completely degraded

374

when a fourfold (or higher) excess of nsp10 over nsp14 was used compared to the

375

effect of merely increasing the nsp14 concentration in the assay (Fig. 6B). Similar

376

observations were previously reported for SARS-CoV nsp14 (20, 26). Introduction of

377

the D90A/E92A motif-I double substitution resulted in a major reduction of ExoN

378

activity, although a certain level of residual activity was observed, in particular when

379

using large amounts of nsp14 (Fig. 6B, right-hand side) or a relatively high

380

nsp10:nsp14 ratio (Fig. 6A, right-hand side). Similar observations were previously

381

made for SARS-CoV nsp14 (Bouvet, Imbert et al. 2012, Ma, Wu et al. 2015).

382

Using a 4:1 ratio of nsp10 versus nsp14, MERS-CoV ExoN activity was analyzed in

383

a time-course experiment, (Fig. 7). Over time, the full-length substrate was

384

progressively converted to a set of degradation products in the size range of 6-18 nt.

385

We anticipated that the structure of the H4 RNA substrate would change from a

386

duplexed to a single-stranded conformation, upon digestion of one side of the hairpin’s

387

stem by ExoN’s nuclease activity. As the ExoN enzymes of other CoVs were reported

388

to prefer dsRNA substrates (19, 65), the degradation of the substrate might be slowed

389

down substantially after removal of the first couple of nucleotides from its 3’ end (26).

390

This would explain the abundant degradation products of 16 and 17 nt in length that

391

were observed (Fig. 6-8), suggesting that the preference for dsRNA substrates is

392

indeed shared by MERS-CoV ExoN.

393

Degradation of the substrate could be observed within 5 min and the full-length

394

substrate was essentially gone after 30 min. A similar reaction with the nsp14 DM

395

mutant resulted in only a small amount of substrate degradation after 90 min (Fig. 7,

396

leftmost lane). Taken together, our results convincingly demonstrate the in vitro 3’-to-

397

5’ exonuclease activity of purified MERS-CoV nsp14. As in the case of the SARS-CoV

398

enzyme, nsp10 is a critical co-factor that can strikingly upregulate MERS-CoV ExoN

399

activity in vitro.

400
401

MERS-CoV nsp10 modulates nsp14 ExoN activity

402

In order to investigate differences that might explain the variable phenotype of CoV

403

ExoN knockout virus mutants, we compared ExoN activities between SARS-CoV and

404

MERS-CoV nsp14, using the optimized in vitro assay described above. An incubation

405

time of 90 min was used in all experiments, unless indicated otherwise The nsp14 and

406

nsp10 preparations of both viruses were first tested individually in an assay containing

407

the H4 RNA substrate and Mg+2 ions (26, 66, 67). As expected, this revealed only

408

traces of exonuclease activity for both nsp14 proteins (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and lane 6).

409

When the two proteins were combined in the same reaction, a strong increase of ExoN

410

activity was observed for both nsp14-nsp10 pairs, with the SARS-CoV pair appearing

411

to be somewhat more processive than the MERS-CoV pair (Fig. 8, lanes 2 and 9).

412

The exchange of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV nsp10 co-factors revealed that

413

they can cross-activate the ExoN activity of nsp14 from the other virus, although some

414

changes in the pattern of degradation products were observed (Fig. 8, Lanes 1-2 and

415

lanes 8-9). However, the residual ExoN activity of the motif I double mutant (DM)

416

apparently was not affected by the choice of nsp10 co-factor (Fig. 8, compare lanes

417

11 and 12). The observed subtle changes in degradation product patterns are another

indication that nsp10 modulates nsp14 ExoN activity, presumably using interaction

419

surfaces that are well-conserved across CoV genera (66, 67).

420
421

ExoN activity of MERS-CoV active site and H229C mutants

422

Having established the optimal conditions for MERS-CoV ExoN in vitro activity, we

423

evaluated the impact of a subset of the DEEDh active site mutations that were used

424

during our reverse genetic analysis (Fig. 2A). For each mutant tested, two protein

425

batches were purified and analyzed independently in duplicate using the same batch

426

of MERS-CoV nsp10 for all assays. As can be seen in Fig. 9, replacement with Ala of

427

each of the five active site residues resulted in a near-complete loss of ExoN activity,

428

with the D90A, E92A, and H268A substitutions appearing to be slightly less detrimental

429

than E191A and motif III D273A. A clearly different result was again obtained with the

430

E191D mutant, which displayed an activity level comparable to that of wt nsp14,

431

corresponding with the properties of the corresponding virus mutant (Fig. 4). Overall,

432

the severe impact of active site mutations on ExoN activity was fully in line with the

433

non-viable phenotypes observed for the same mutants when tested using reverse

434

genetics (Fig. 2).

435

We also evaluated the impact of the H229C ZF1 mutation, which – despite its

436

conservative nature - yielded a crippled mutant virus (Fig. 2) and of two N7-MTase

437

mutations (discussed below). The N7-MTase mutants displayed wt nsp14-like ExoN

438

activities (Fig. 9), suggesting that – as in SARS-CoV nsp14 - ExoN and N7-MTase

439

activities are functionally separated (36). Analyzing the substrate degradation pattern

440

of the H229C mutant (Fig. 7), the enzyme seems to be somewhat crippled when

441

compared to wt nsp14. This suggests that this mutation alters ExoN activity in vitro,

442

potentially by affecting the structure of the ExoN domain, as ZF1 is in close proximity

443

of the nsp10 interaction surface (20). However, a similar reduction of ExoN activity was

444

observed for the E191D mutant (Fig. 7), which was much more viable than the H229C

445

mutant in the context of our reverse genetics studies. This suggests that the H229C

446

replacement may affect additional functions or interactions of the ExoN domain that

447

are important for viral RNA synthesis and viability.

448
449

ExoN mutations do not interfere with N7-MTase activity in vitro

450

The nsp14 N7-MTtase activity is deemed essential for formation of a functional RNA

451

cap, enabling the translation of CoV mRNAs and protecting them from degradation.

452

Consequently, at least in theory, ExoN mutations could also be detrimental for virus

453

replication if they would somehow affect the crucial enzymatic activity of the other

454

nsp14 domain. In order to evaluate this possibility, the same recombinant protein

455

preparations used in the ExoN assays (Fig. 9) were evaluated in an N7-MTase

456

biochemical assay using the synthetic cap analogues GpppA and m7GpppA (control)

457

as substrates. Moreover, nsp14 mutants R310A and D331A were used as negative

458

controls in view of their predicted involvement in the binding of the triphosphate moiety

459

of the RNA chain and the methyl donor (S-adenosylmethionine; SAM), respectively

460

(20, 26, 36). In this assay, nsp14 can methylate GpppA by transferring the [3H]CH3

461

moiety provided by [3H]SAM. The resulting radio-labelled m7GpppA product can be

462

quantified using a DEAE filter-binding assay, followed by liquid scintillation counting,

463

and data normalization against the activity of wt control protein (25).

464

Recombinant MERS-CoV nsp14 was found to methylate GpppA, but not m7GpppA

465

(Fig. 10A), which yielded a signal that was similar to the background signal in assays

466

lacking nsp14 or substrate (data not shown). Methylation increased with time until

467

reaching a plateau after 120 min (Fig. 10B). The N7-MTase activity of the various

468

nsp14 mutants was compared with that of wt nsp14 after reaction times of 30 and 120

469

min (Fig. 10C). While the R310A and D331A control mutations fully inactivated the N7-

470

MTase activity of MERS-CoV nsp14, none of the ExoN active site mutations tested

471

was found to alter the enzyme’s activity. These results again support the notion that

472

ExoN and N7-MTase domains are functionally separated, as previously demonstrated

473

for SARS-CoV-nsp14 (36). We therefore conclude that the lethal impact of ExoN

474

inactivation on MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 2A) cannot be attributed to inadvertent

475

effects on the activity of the N7-MTase domain that is present in the same nsp14

476

replicase subunit.

477
478

DISCUSSION

479

In this study of MERS-CoV nsp14, we demonstrate that the impact of ExoN inactivation

480

on virus viability and RNA synthesis distinguishes MERS-CoV from two other

481

betacoronaviruses, MHV and SARS-CoV. Whereas ExoN inactivation in the latter two

482

viruses yields viable mutants that are only mildly crippled and exhibit a “mutator

483

phenotype” (22, 23, 29), both conservative and alanine substitutions of MERS-CoV

484

ExoN catalytic residues abolished all detectable viral RNA synthesis (Fig. 3) and the

485

release of viral progeny (Fig. 2). The only exception was the conservative E191D

486

mutant, which was found to exhibit near-wild-type levels of ExoN activity (Fig. 7 and

487

9). Based on nsp14 conservation (Fig. 1) and the viable phenotype of SARS-CoV and

488

MHV ExoN-knockout mutants, MERS-CoV was expected to tolerate ExoN inactivation,

489

in particular since the enzyme was proposed to improve the fidelity of CoV replication

490

without being essential for RNA synthesis per se (10, 14, 21-23, 26, 29). This notion is

491

further supported by the fact that the CoV RdRp (nsp12) exhibits in vitro activity in the

492

absence of nsp14 (27). We therefore anticipated that an excess of deleterious

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.162529; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

493

mutations would first have to accumulate before becoming detrimental to MERS-CoV

494

viability. Contrary to these expectations, an immediate and complete block of RNA

495

synthesis was observed when MERS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants were launched by

496

transfection of full-length RNA transcripts. It is noteworthy that similar observations

497

were previously made for the corresponding ExoN knockout mutants of the alpha-

498

CoVs HCoV-229E (19) and TGEV (34), the gamma-CoV avian infectious bronchitis

499

virus (IBV) (E. Bickerton, S. Keep, and P. Britton, personal communication), and –

500

according to a recent report that awaits peer review - also for SARS-CoV-2 (30), a

501

close relative of SARS-CoV.

502

None of the ExoN mutations tested had a negative effect on the in vitro activity of

503

the N7-MTase domain of nsp14, which is deemed essential for viral mRNA capping

504

(Fig. 10). This is consistent with previous observations for SARS-CoV nsp14, in which

505

the ExoN and N7-MTase activities were shown to be functionally distinct, though

506

structurally interconnected by a hinge region that confers flexibility (21, 36). Given their

507

unchanged N7-MTase activity, the non-viable phenotype of MERS-CoV ExoN active

508

site mutants must be attributed to a negative effect on an additional and apparently

509

critical function of the ExoN domain, which is directly involved in primary RNA synthesis

510

rather than in (longer-term) fidelity control. At present we cannot explain, why SARS-

511

CoV and MHV ExoN knockouts can apparently tolerate ExoN active site substitutions

512

that are lethal to five other CoVs (now including MERS-CoV). Within the

513

betacoronavirus group, in our experience, SARS-CoV and MHV display the most

514

robust RNA synthesis and replication in cell culture when compared to MERS-CoV and

515

SARS-CoV-2 (68-70). Possibly, the recovery of viable progeny depends on reaching

516

a minimum level of RNA synthesis, which may somehow be achieved by only the most

517

efficiently replicating CoVs. Admittedly, even bearing this possibility in mind, it remains

518

difficult to reconcile the 1- to 2-log reduction of progeny titers observed for MHV and

519

SARS-CoV ExoN-knockout mutants with the complete loss of infectious progeny

520

observed for the ExoN-knockout mutants of the other CoVs.

521

In order to eliminate technicalities that might somehow prohibit the successful

522

recovery of MERS-CoV ExoN knockout mutants and explain the phenotypic

523

differences with other CoVs, we explored various details in the transfection protocol.

524

This included the use of a DNA-launched system, similar to that used for TGEV (34),

525

and the propagation of progeny virus in both innate immune-competent

526

and -incompetent cells (Huh7 and Vero cells, respectively). However, this did not

527

change the negative outcome of our transfection experiments, which were repeated

528

more than 10 times for several mutants, always using wt and E191D MERS-CoV as

529

positive controls that proved to be consistently viable. Our extensive set of MERS-CoV

530

ExoN mutants tested, and the results obtained with various other CoVs (see above),

531

strengthen our conclusion that – in addition to its proposed role as a proofreading

532

enzyme – ExoN must have another function in CoV RNA synthesis (57).

533

As reported for MHV and SARS-CoV ExoN mutants (23, 71), possible (late)

534

reversion was observed for a few of our MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutants,

535

specifically mutants E191A, D273E, and in particular D90E, which had reverted at 6 d

536

p.t. in three out of six experiments. This suggests that these mutants exhibit a low

537

residual level of RNA synthesis that is the basis for these low-frequency events. In

543

studies will address the properties of these nsp14 ExoN knockout mutants and their

544

(pseudo) revertants in more detail.

545

In the only viable MERS-CoV ExoN active site mutant obtained, E191D, the catalytic

546

motif was changed from DEEDh to the DEDDh that is characteristic of all members of

547

the exonuclease family that ExoN belongs to (14, 15, 75). The phenotype of the E191D

548

virus mutant was comparable to that of wt virus (Fig. 4). Biochemical assays revealed

549

that E191D-ExoN enzyme is able to hydrolyze a dsRNA substrate with an activity level

550

approaching that of the wt protein (Fig. 9). Additionally, the E191D mutant behaved

551

similar as wt MERS-CoV upon treatment of infected cells with the mutagenic agent 5-

552

FU (Fig. 4C-D) (28, 71), again suggesting its ExoN activity is not dramatically altered

553

by this conservative substitution in the active site.

554

In this study, we developed an in vitro assay to evaluate MERS-CoV ExoN activity

555

using a largely double-stranded RNA substrate (Fig. 6 and 7). As previously observed

556

for SARS-CoV nsp14 (26), MERS-CoV ExoN activity was strongly enhanced by the

557

presence of nsp10 (Fig. 8), in line with the formation of an nsp10:nsp14 heterodimer

558

as observed in biochemical and structural studies (20, 26, 76). Slightly different

559

patterns of degradation of the H4 substrate were observed when comparing the SARS-

560

CoV and MERS-CoV ExoN enzymes in vitro. Likewise, the exchange of the nsp10 co-

561

factor for the nsp10 subunit of the other virus, using the same substrate and the same

562

nsp10:nsp14 ratio (1:4; Fig. 8), resulted in a slightly different pattern of substrate

563

degradation, suggesting minor differences in the interaction of the nsp10:nsp14

564

complex with this particular RNA substrate. Previously, it was demonstrated that nsp10

565

is interchangeable between CoV subgenera in its role as co-factor for the nsp16 2′-O-

566

methyltransferase, which was attributed to the high level of conservation of the nsp10-

567

nsp16 interaction surface (77). As nsp14 and nsp16 share a common interaction

568

surface on nsp10 (21, 26, 66), we explored whether a similar co-factor exchange was

569

possible in the context of nsp14’s ExoN activity, which was indeed found to be the case

570

(Fig. 8). Structurally, nsp14 interacts with nsp10 figuratively similar to a “hand (nsp14)

571

over fist (nsp10)” conformation (21). In the formation of this complex, nsp10 induces

572

conformational changes in the N-terminal region of ExoN that adjusts the distance

573

between the catalytic residues in the back of the nsp14 palm and, consequently, impact

574

ExoN activity (21). The exchange of the nsp10 co-factor between the two beta-CoVs

575

might affect this conformation and, consequently, modulate the ExoN activity of the

576

nsp14:nsp10 complex.

577

Alanine substitutions of active site residues severely reduced but did not completely

578

abrogated the in vitro activity of MERS-CoV ExoN (Fig. 7-9), as previously shown for

579

certain SARS-CoV nsp14 mutants (20, 36). Based on the two-ion-metal catalytic

580

mechanism underlying the exonuclease activity of DEDDh family members (17, 56)

581

and the SARS-CoV nsp14 structure, it was predicted that the various ExoN motifs

582

contribute differently to the excision of nucleosides monophosphates (20, 21). Mutation

583

of ExoN catalytic residues can alter ion binding (31) or disturb the fragile chemical

584

equilibrium, as shown for conservative mutations (corresponding to E191D and

585

D273E) in the Klenow fragment, a member of the DEDDh exonuclease family, which

586

reduced ExoN activity by >96% (78). In general, all DEEDh mutations that yielded non-

587

viable virus mutants exhibited similarly low levels of residual ExoN activity in vitro (Fig.

588

9), indicating that each of these residues is important for catalysis.

589

Our study suggests that, in addition to the active site residues, also other motifs in

590

MERS-CoV ExoN are important for virus viability, specifically the two ZF motifs that

591

were probed using two point mutations each (Fig. 2A). In previous ZF1 studies, a

592

mutation equivalent to H229A created solubility issues during expression of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.162529; this version posted June 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

593

recombinant SARS-CoV nsp14 (20) and resulted in a partially active ExoN in the case

594

of white bream virus, a torovirus that also belongs to the nidovirus order (79). It was

595

suggested that ZF1 contributes to the structural stability of ExoN, as it is close to the

596

surface that interacts with nsp10 (20). Here, we demonstrate that the more

597

conservative H229C replacement, which converts ZF1 from a non-classical CCCH

598

type ZF motif into a classical CCCC type (63), was tolerated during recombinant protein

599

expression and yielded an ExoN that is quite active in vitro (Fig. 7). This likely

600

contributed to the fact that the H229C virus mutant retained a low level of viability (Fig.

601

2), although its overall crippled phenotype and the non-viable phenotype of mutant

602

C201H clearly highlight the general importance of ZF1 for virus replication. In contrast,

603

the corresponding TGEV mutant (ZF-C) was not strongly affected and could be stably

604

maintained over several passages (34) The reverse genetics data suggest that ZF2,

605

which is in close proximity to ExoN catalytic residues (20), is equally important,

606

although technical complications with expression of the C261A and H264R nsp14

607

mutants prevented us to perform in vitro activity assays.

608

Like the ExoN domain of the arenavirus nucleoprotein (32, 33), the CoV ExoN was

609

proposed to be involved in innate immune evasion (34, 35, 80), possibly by degrading

610

viral ds RNA that in the case of CoVs is confined to characteristic double-membrane

611

vesicles (81, 82). For TGEV, this suggestion was based on the reduced accumulation

612

of dsRNA by the ZF-C mutant, which however remains to be characterized in more

613

detail. In the absence of a TGEV ExoN activity assay, and in view of our data for the

614

equivalent MERS-CoV ZF1 mutant, it seems premature to assume that the reduced

615

levels of dsRNA in infected cells are caused by increased exonuclease activity of the

616

ZF-C ExoN mutant (34).

617

In general, the properties of viable CoV ExoN mutants warrant further analysis. In

618

future studies, the repertoire of residues probed by site-directed mutagenesis should

619

be extended beyond active site and ZF motifs, which may help in particular to establish

620

how directly reduced ExoN activity, primary viral RNA synthesis and enhanced innate

621

responses are connected. Regardless of its possible interactions with host cell

622

pathways, nsp14 clearly is a key subunit of the multi-enzyme complex that drives CoV

623

genome

624

Understanding the structure-function interplay between ExoN and other (viral and/or

625

host) components will be key to elucidating its role in CoV RNA synthesis and evolution

626

(83, 84). Taking into account the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, understanding the

627

phenotypic differences between ExoN knockout mutants of different CoVs may

628

contribute to the design of improved antiviral approaches, including those relying on

‘lethal mutagenesis’ or direct interference with viral RNA synthesis.

Reverse genetics

645

Mutations in the MERS-CoV nsp14-coding region were engineered in a bacterial

646

artificial chromosome (BAC) vector (51, 52) containing the full-length cDNA copy of

647

MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 (44, 53), by two-step en passant recombineering in E.

648

coli (86). When designing the primers, a translationally silent marker mutation was

649

introduced near the site of mutagenesis in order to differentiate between the

650

occurrence of reversion and (possible) contamination with parental virus. For each

651

mutation, two mutant BACs were isolated independently, the nsp14-coding region was

652

verified by sequencing, and both BACs were used for in vitro run-off transcription and

653

virus launching.

654

Approximately 5 µg of BAC DNA was linearized with NotI and full-length RNA was

655

obtained by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase followed by lithium chloride

656

precipitation according to the manufacturer's protocol (mMessage-mMachine T7 Kit;

657

Ambion). 5 µg of RNA was electroporated into 5x106 BHK-21 cells using the Amaxa

658

nucleofector 2b (program A-031) and Nucleofection T solution kit (Lonza). Transfected

659

BHK-21 cells were mixed with HuH7 or Vero cells in a 1:1 ratio and plated for

intracellular RNA was isolated at 18 h post infection as described above. cDNA was

synthesized by reverse transcription using RevertedAid H minus reverse transcriptase

(ThermoFischer Scientific) and random hexamer primers (Promega), in combination

672

with a primer targeting the 3’ end of the MERS-CoV genome. The full-length genome

or the nsp14-coding region were amplified by PCR using MyTaq DNA polymerase

674

(Bioline) and after purification the PCR product was sequenced by Sanger sequencing.

675

Genome sequencing by NGS was performed as described before (70). All work with

To compare the effect of 5-FU treatment on the progeny titers of wt and nsp14-

716

E191D rMERS-CoV, confluent monolayers of HuH7 were incubated for 30 min at 37⁰C

717

with solvent or a range of 5-FU concentrations. The drug was then removed and cells

718

were infected at an MOI of 0.1 during 1 h at 37⁰C. After removal of the inoculum, EMEM

719

containing 2% FCS and solvent or a matching concentration of 5-FU was added to the

was kindly provided by Dr. Deyin Guo (77) (91) and purified according to their protocol.

729

All MERS-CoV nsp14 constructs were cloned into expression vector pDEST14 with an

N-terminal His6-tag using the Gateway system (25). MERS-CoV nsp14 mutant

731

expression plasmids were generated by Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis using

Next, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000xg for 30 min, and the soluble fraction was

741

column-purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using Nickel

746

molecular mass cut-off of 30 kDa (Millipore), and protein concentrations were

747

measured using spectrophotometry. All purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE

748

followed by Coomassie blue staining as well as by Western blot using a mouse
