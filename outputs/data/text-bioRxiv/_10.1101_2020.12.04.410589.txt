Abstract:
Background: SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 36,000,000 cases and 1,000,000 deaths globally.
Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted anti-viral antibody response is critical for diagnosis,
differentiation of severe disease, and characterization of long-term immunity. Initial observations suggest
that severe disease is associated with higher antibody levels and greater B cell/plasmablast responses. A
multi-antigen immunoassay to define the complex serological landscape and clinical associations is
essential.
Methods: We developed a multiplex immunoassay and evaluated serum/plasma from adults with RTPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections during acute illness (N=52) and convalescence (N=69); and prepandemic (N=106) and post-pandemic (N=137) healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM
against SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N), Spike domain 1 (S1), receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) and
S1-N-terminal domain (S1-NTD).
Results: To diagnose infection, the combined [IgA+IgG+IgM] or IgG for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded
AUC values &#8805;0.90 by ROC curves. From days 6-30 post-symptom onset, the levels of antigenspecific IgG, IgA or [IgA+IgG+IgM] were higher in patients with severe/critical compared to
mild/moderate infections. Consistent with excessive concentrations of antibodies, a strong prozone effect
was observed in sera from severe/critical patients. Notably, mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise
and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared to severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG
and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 months.
Conclusion: This SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity and
kinetics of the antibody response against multiple viral antigens. The IgG and combined-isotype SARSCoV-2 multiplex assay is highly diagnostic of acute and convalescent disease and may prognosticate
severity early in illness.

Introduction
Since SARS-CoV2 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the outbreak has evolved
into a global pandemic with 36,500,000 cases and over 1,000,000 fatalities as of October 2020.
Nasopharyngeal RT-PCR is the diagnostic gold standard but varies widely(1, 2) due to timing and quality
of sample acquisition. Serologic assays can fill gaps especially for asymptomatic infections and for
diagnosis later in disease course even when RNA is undetectable(3). Although most patients do well, a
small subset succumbs to severe life-threatening disease. Anti-virals and immunomodulatory therapies
can decrease disease duration and improve mortality(4, 5). Biomarkers to identify at-risk patients may
provide opportunities to intervene earlier and improve clinical outcomes.
SARS-CoV-2 Serology: Characterization of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production is essential for
identifying COVID-19 immunity(6-9). However, the dynamics of the antibody response and its
dependence on clinical severity are additional considerations for interpreting serological results. For
example, the evolution of B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 does not always follow the model of IgM
preceding IgG. Instead, many SARS-CoV-2-infected patients demonstrated a simultaneous rise in IgM
and class-switched IgG(10-12). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (S1-RBD)
showed correlation with viral neutralization(13) but other immunogenic viral proteins include: S1 and S2
subunits of the spike protein, spike N-terminal domain (S1-NTD), and the nucleocapsid protein (N)(14).
The spike protein mediates viral entry into the host cell through the S1 subunit that binds ACE2 receptors
on host cells and S2 that is involved in fusion. Monoclonal neutralizing antibodies have been generated
against the S trimer, RBD, and NTD domains(15-18). However, antibody-based diagnostics assays can
utilize antigens with neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes; thus, we examined anti-S1, anti-S1-RBD,
anti-S1-NTD and anti-N antibodies.
Higher antibody levels in severe/critical disease. The host response to SARS-CoV-2 varies
dramatically among individuals. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detectable in patients who have

recovered from infection; the magnitude and kinetics of serological responses correlate with clinical
severity(3, 19-23). Reports on SARS-CoV-1 infections showed a paradoxical rise of neutralizing
antibodies in critically ill patients(24). Similarly, in SARS-CoV-2, the induction of virus-specific antibody
responses in severe disease trend higher than in non-severe patients 8-20 days post-symptom onset
(DPSO)(10, 22). However, there was significant overlap of antibody levels between the two groups such
that it could not distinguish mild from severe illness. Other studies corroborated these findings with
binding and neutralizing antibodies, but the numbers were small and timing of sample collection was late
in disease course(25-27).
In this study, we developed a sensitive anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay using pre-pandemic
controls and RT-PCR-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and observed higher antibody levels
earlier in patients with severe/critical infections compared to those with mild/moderate disease. This
unexpected difference in the speed and magnitude of humoral responses may reflect important differences
in the immune response and provide early signs for patients who might benefit from targeted
immunomodulatory interventions.

Results
Acute and convalescent SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. 353 adults were enrolled for this study:
110 RT-PCR-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and 243 healthy adult controls (Table S1). The
pre-pandemic control group consisted of 106 adults whose samples were collected between July 2016 and
February 2019. The post-pandemic control group, who had no known exposure to SARS-CoV-2,
consisted of 137 adults whose blood samples were collected between March and June 2020.
We enrolled 69 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients after recovery from illness and at least 31 DPSO.
This convalescent population provided serum samples used for development and validation of the

immunoassay (Figs.1,3). Nineteen patients had severe/critical disease (10 severe; 9 critical) and 50
suffered mild/moderate infections (34 mild; 16 moderate) as defined by the NIH criteria(28).
We enrolled 52 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients during their acute infections (<31 DPSO). Eleven
patients were in both the acute and convalescent populations. There were 39 patients classified as
severe/critical (3 severe, 36 critical) and 13 as mild/moderate (13 mild, 0 moderate).
SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay. Using sera from 69 convalescent patients, we developed a
SARS-CoV-2 multiplex immunoassay to detect the combined [IgA+IgG+IgM] or individual IgA, IgG, or
IgM responses specific for four viral antigens nucleocapsid (N), S1, S1-RBD, and S1-NTD (Fig.1A). Cutoff values (C0) were set at the mean plus three standard deviations for each antigen:secondary antibody
combination using the pre-pandemic control population (N=106; Fig.1A).

Receiver operating

characteristic (ROC) curves, where the area-under-the-curve (AUC) provides an estimate of diagnostic
potential, are presented in Fig.1B.
For the combined isotype [IgA+IgG+IgM] detection, responses to three of the candidate antigens,
N, S1 and S1-RBD, had significant diagnostic potential (AUC≥0.98); the response to S1-NTD was
relatively poor (AUC=0.73) (Fig.1B).

Overall, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM antibodies were poor

predictors of convalescent infection; AUC values were low for IgM S1-NTD (AUC=0.52) and N
(AUC=0.54), although, IgM levels for S1 (AUC=0.88) and S1-RBD (AUC=0.93) were potentially useful.
IgA antibodies were fairly strong predictors of convalescent infection with AUC values greater than 0.95
for S1 and S1-RBD. However, IgG responses had the greatest diagnostic potential for each of the three
antigens N, S1 and S1-RBD (AUC≥0.98); anti-S1-NTD IgG was lower (AUC=0.85). In the convalescent
population, IgG responses against the S1 or the S1-RBD antigens were specific and sensitive for
identifying patients who had experienced SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Prozone effect in patients with severe disease. To assess sample limitations in the assay, we
titrated ten serum samples: four from patients with severe/critical disease, three from patients with

mild/moderate disease, and three from pre-pandemic controls. We observed the expected log-linear doseresponse curves in the mild/moderate samples, but we detected bell-shaped binding curves in the
severe/critical groups, indicative of the prozone effect in the antigen:antibody interactions for N, S1, and
S1-RBD (Fig.2A). Subsequent analyses were performed with samples diluted 1:500 to maximize the
measurement of low-responding mild/moderate patients while minimizing the potential impact of the
prozone effect in severe/critical patients.
Antibody concentrations in serum of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. To estimate a quantity of
antibodies using monoclonal antibody standards, we measured anti-S1 IgG concentrations were as high
as 45 µg/mL in sera from mild/moderate patients and 100-400 µg/mL in sera from severe/critical patients.
N-specific antibodies ranged from 1-20 µg/mL and 17-49 µg/mL in the same groups.
Serum and plasma samples yield similar results. Nearly identical binding curves from a small set
of paired serum and plasma samples were observed including the prozone effect (Fig.2B). Paired serum
and plasma samples from 50 subjects yielded similar MFI values with particularly high correlations
(R2>0.83) for S1 and S1-RBD antigens (Fig.2C). Measurement of antibody levels at a 1:500 dilution
resulted in comparable values for serum and plasma samples from severe/critical and mild/moderate
patients.
Elevated levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera from convalescent patients with
severe/critical infections compared to those with mild/moderate disease. We observed a correlation
between disease severity and the magnitude of the antibody response when the convalescent COVID-19
patients were divided into mild/moderate (N=50) and severe/critical (N=19) cohorts. (Fig.3).

The

combined isotype response and IgG alone against S1 and S1-RBD resolved the two populations
significantly (AUC>0.9; Fig.S1).

The IgA and IgM responses to the viral antigens were less

discriminating of the two groups (AUC<0.86). N and S1-NTD were not useful antigens for separating the
severe/critical from the mild/moderate groups (AUC<0.86), except for S1-NTD IgG (AUC>0.91).

Elevated antibody levels in convalescent severe/critical patients suggested that this striking difference
may be evident earlier during infection.
Elevated serum antibody levels early in infection of severe/critical patients. Among the 110
infected patients, sera were collected from 50 patients within 6-30 DPSO (39 severe/critical, 11
mild/moderate infections; median draw: 13 DPSO). As in the convalescent population, S1 and S1-RBD
antigens yielded the greatest diagnostic potential (AUC≥0.94) in combined or individual isotypes
(Fig.S2). In contrast to the convalescent serum samples, measurement of IgA, IgG or the combined
isotypes against N exhibited potential utility (AUC≥0.90). Furthermore, in acute illness, IgA specific to
N, S1 and S1-RBD as well as IgM to S1 and S1-RBD yielded significantly better AUC values than they
did in the convalescent patient population (Fig.1B). Thus, IgA, IgM or IgG could potentially be used for
detection of early infection.
Separating the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients by disease severity reveals striking differences
between the mild/moderate and severe/critical populations (Fig.4). As in the convalescent population, the
strongest predictors of severe/critical infections were the combined isotypes and IgG responses to the S1
and S1-RBD (AUC>0.91, Fig.S3). However, in the interval 6-30 DPSO, anti-S1, anti-S1-RBD, and antiN IgG or the combined isotypes showed comparably high AUC values (Fig.4, Fig.S3). IgG and IgA, but
not IgM, predominated in the patients with early severe/critical disease suggesting that early classswitched responses are evident in severe/critical infections.
Kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in severe/critical and mild/moderate groups. To
determine the kinetics, magnitude, and durability of serum antibody responses, we analyzed sera from 165
samples that included 53 severe/critical and 57 mild/moderate patients ranging from 2-150 DPSO (Fig.5).
There was an early significant increase in antibody responses in the severe/critical groups for nearly all
isotypes specific for N, S1, S1-RBD and S1-NTD. The only exception was IgM for S1-NTD (Table S2).
At later time points >90 days, the antibody responses were similar between the two groups. These results

suggest that for the severe/critical cohort, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies rise rapidly while in the
mild/moderate group antibodies rises slower. In summary, disease severity can affect magnitude, isotype,
specificity, and potentially durability of antibody responses.
Viral neutralization detected in serum with high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels. Neutralizing
antibodies are capable of blocking the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the ACE2 receptor
on the surface of target cells. To determine whether sera from infected patients had SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing activity, we tested a representative subset of 19 plasma samples drawn within 30 DPSO from
12 severe/critical patients, 4 mild/moderate patients, and 3 healthy pre-pandemic subjects using a
surrogate viral neutralization test (sVNT) (29).

Sera from patients in the severe/critical group

demonstrated inhibition of ACE2 receptor-binding activity by HRP-conjugated S1-RBD, achieving 50%
reductions at several hundred-fold dilutions (Log10 sIC50 median = 2.48), compared to little or no
measurable activity (Log10 sIC50 <0.5) in the mild/moderate and healthy control groups (Fig. 6A). Using
CR3022 (InvivoGen) and 6G9 (Amsbio) as controls, we also titrated the S1-RBD antibodies and found
concentrations of 0-45 ug/mL and 100-400 ug/mL in mild/moderate and severe/critical cohorts,
respectively. N-specific antibodies ranged from 1-20 ug/mL and 17-49 ug/mL in mild/moderate and
severe/critical groups, respectively. In a second population of severe/critical (N=15) and mild/moderate
(N=10) patients in Fig. 6B (p < 0.0001), we validated assessed neutralization using the sVNT. In
plasma/serum samples collected in the convalescent stage of the infection (days 37 to 140), the
neutralizing titers in severe/critical patients (N=8) decline slightly while those measured in the
mild/moderate patients (N=23) rise substantially to near equivalence with the severe/critical population.

Discussion
In order to visualize the comprehensive landscape of SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity, we
developed a sensitive, multiplex immunoassay for detection of acute infection and previous viral exposure.

This immunoassay detects individual or combined IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies against viral antigens N,
S1, S1-RBD, and S1-NTD. Due to its wide dynamic range, the assay can also distinguish severe/critical
from mild/moderate infections and potentially prognosticate severity early in infection. However, we
observed in severe/critical sera an unexpected prozone effect that may have been underappreciated in prior
studies. Additionally, neutralizing antibodies correlated with viral-specific antibody titers, particularly in
severe/critical patients early in disease and rose in mild/moderate patients only after recovery. For
diagnosis of acute and convalescent infections, the combined-isotype or IgG immunoassays for anti-S1RBD performed best, although anti-N and anti-S1 provided confirmation. To distinguish mild/moderate
from severe/critical infections, measurement of combined isotypes or IgG specific for S1-RBD, S1, or N
had high predictive values (AUC≥0.90). In particular, anti-S1-RBD was excellent for both diagnosis and
prognosis of severity.
Differences in longitudinal antibody responses and disease severity. Magnitude and kinetics of
SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses differed with disease severity. Severe/critical patients (nine of whom
died) reached very high titers against N, S1, and S1-RBD at 6-20 DPSO. These early responses consisted
of not only IgM but primarily of class-switched IgG and IgA antibodies.
The decline in antibody levels occurred at different rates for several antigen:isotype combinations.
The levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM against N and S1 decline rapidly after recovery in the severe/critical
group; thus, they would not useful for convalescent diagnosis. In contrast, the mild/moderate patients had
slower rises of antibody titers, mostly after 30 DPSO, and slower declines evident only after 3-4 months.
Patients with severe/critical disease have increased ASC expansions early in infection(12, 30, 31)
associated with higher antibody levels compared to those observed in mild/moderate patients. Together,
these results suggest different sources of B cells and ASC in the severe/critical and mild/moderate
infection groups.

Prozone effect and previous underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: We could discriminate
serum titers between severe/critical and mild/moderate patients early in illness due to the sensitivity of
this platform. It is well known that the prozone (or hook) effect occurs when an excess of antigen or
antibody inhibits the formation of cross-linked Ag-Ab complexes(32-35). In our assay, this effect was
observed at higher serum concentrations demonstrating abundant antibody levels in severe/critical
patients. Concentrations of anti-S1-RBD IgG rose to 100-400 µg/mL in severe/critical patients by 10
DPSO and approached similar levels in mild/moderates after 30 DPSO. Our results suggest that previous
studies may have underestimated titers in patients with severe disease due to the prozone effect. Thus,
the need for optimizing performance characteristics for these assays will be essential as we standardize
serologic testing.
Severe/critical and mild/moderate patients display striking differences in their humoral immune
responses: clinical significance and immunological basis. Severe/critical patients produce a vigorous early
antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 comprised primarily of IgG and IgA, and little IgM. In contrast,
mild/moderate patients develop a conventional immune response that develops over 4-6 weeks. The
striking early response produced by severe/critical patients may enable early detection of the patients most
likely to experience poor outcomes.
Conventional models of B cell responses to primary infections include an early extrafollicular
response that provides a short-lived IgM wave of antibodies with very low mutation load and antigen
affinity. This extrafollicular phase precedes subsequent germinal center reactions that generate memory
B cells and plasma cells that secrete higher affinity, isotype-switched antibodies(36). It is now evident
however that extrafollicular responses also generate isotype-switched antibody responses(37), and that
this process may indeed be prominent in SARS-CoV-2 infections as recently demonstrated by our groups
and others(12, 38). Moreover, our work showed that severe infection is strongly associated with intense
extrafollicular B cell responses producing IgG and IgA antibodies with very low levels of somatic

hypermutation despite the presence of high neutralizing antibody titers(12). In keeping with our results,
severe COVID-19 infections create profound disruption of germinal center structures(38). Combined, the
available evidence strongly suggests that early responses to SARS-CoV-2 may be comprised of
simultaneous early generation of IgM, IgG and IgA responses with low mutation rates through intense
extrafollicular responses and defective germinal center reaction. This profile would be exaggerated in
severe cases. Late and post-infection responses would depend on the degree of initial disruption and/or
subsequent restoration of proper germinal center responses.
In all, our sensitive, multiplex immunoassay is ideal for diagnosis of acute and convalescent
infections and important for predicting severity early in the disease course. We conclude that the virusspecific antibody kinetics vary depending on disease severity and we speculate that specific viral antigens
will have implications for long-term humoral protection to SARS-CoV-2 re-infection.

Materials and Methods
Institutional Approval for Patient Sample Collection. All blood and tissue samples were collected
under the Emory University Institutional Review Board approved protocols. Pre-pandemic samples were
collected from healthy adults prior to the pandemic between July 2016 and February 2019. After the start
of the pandemic, samples were collected from March-June 2020 from healthy adults with no known
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1). Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 infections were
enrolled from Emory University hospitals and outpatient facilities. Severity of SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients was determined according to NIH guidelines(28) (Table S1). Patients were categorized based on
their overall disease course as mild/moderate or severe/critical. Samples collected in the first 30 DPSO
were considered acute and those collected after 30 DPSO were designated convalescent. All samples were
processed within 4-12 hours of collection and stored at -80C for subsequent analysis.

Selection of Antigens. Four recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens were used in this study. The
Nucleocapsid protein (N; Cat. No. Z03480; expressed in E. coli), the S1 domain (S1; amino acids 16-685;
Cat. No. Z03485; expressed in HEK293 cells) of the Spike protein, and the S1-Receptor Binding Domain
(S1-RBD; Cat. No Z03483; expressed in HEK293 cells) were purchased from by GenScript. The S1-Nterminal domain (S1-NTD, amino acids 16-318) was custom synthesized by GenScript. Each protein was
expressed with an N-terminal His6-Tag to facilitate purification, greater than 85% pure and appeared as a
predominant single band on SDS-PAGE analysis.
Carbodiimide coupling of microspheres to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were
coupled to MagPlex® Microspheres of spectrally distinct regions (Luminex; Austin, TX, USA). Coupling
was carried out at room temperature following standard carbodiimide coupling procedures. Microspheres
were washed once with deionized water and incubated for 20 minutes in the dark in an end-over-end
rotator suspension of 0.1 M NaH2PO4 (VWR; Radnor, PA, USA), 5 mg/mL EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA), and 5 mg/mL
Sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA, USA). Activated
microspheres were washed twice in 0.05 M MES (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid, Boston
Bioproducts, Ashland, MA, USA) and incubated for two hours in the dark, in an end-over-end rotator 500
µL suspension of 0.05 M MES containing 300 nMol/L antigen and 1x106 microspheres (0.15 nMol antigen
per 106 microspheres). Coupled microspheres were washed four times in a blocking buffer consisting of
1% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin; Boston Bioproducts; Ashland, MA, USA), 1X PBS (VWR; Radnor,
PA, USA), 0.05 % sodium azide (VWR; Radnor, PA, USA), and 0.02 % Tween-20 (VWR; Radnor, PA,
USA). Coupled microspheres were then stored at a concentration of 106 spheres/mL at 4 ˚C in the same
blocking buffer. Concentrations of spheres were confirmed by counting on a Bio-Rad T20 Cell Counter.

(Greiner Bio-One North America Inc., Monroe, NC, USA) at a concentration of 1000 microspheres per
region per well. All wash steps and dilutions were accomplished using 1% BSA, 1X PBS assay buffer.
Except when assay parameters were under development (Fig. 2), serum was assayed at 1:500 dilution and
surveyed for antibodies specific for the four candidate antigens. After a one-hour incubation, in the dark,
on a plate shaker at 800 rpm, wells were washed five times in 100 µL of assay buffer, using a BioTek 405
TS plate washer. Then, the secondary reagent, PE-conjugated Goat Anti-Human IgA, IgG and/or IgM
(Southern Biotech; Birmingham, AL, USA), was added at 3 µg/mL. After 30 minutes of incubation at
800 rpm in the dark, wells were washed three times in 100 µL of assay buffer, resuspended in 100 µL of
assay buffer, and analyzed using a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D® instrument (Luminex; Austin, TX, USA)
running xPonent 4.3 software. Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI) using combined or individual detection
antibodies (anti-IgA/anti-IgG/anti-IgM) was measured using the Luminex xPONENT software. The
background value of assay buffer was subtracted from each serum sample result to obtain Median
Fluorescent Intensity minus Background (MFI-B or Net MFI).
Determination of Cut-off (C0) Values. Determination of cut-off values was based on quantitative
evaluation of the pre-pandemic healthy controls. The C0 for each antigen/secondary combination was
defined as the mean plus three standard deviations of the 106 pre-pandemic samples.
Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT) and antibody concentrations. Circulating antibodies
that block the interaction between ACE2 receptor and SARS-CoV-2 RBD were measured using a recently
described surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT)(29), following manufacturer's recommendations.
Briefly, plasma or serum samples were diluted with sample dilution buffer, followed by incubation with
HRP-conjugated SARS-CoV-2 RBD (HRP-S1-RBD); the mixtures were then transferred to 96-well plates
coated with immobilized, recombinant ACE2 receptor. Following washing and TMB development, the
optical density values at 450 nm were measured. The level of inhibition, i.e., the reduction of binding of
HRP-RBD to the immobilized ACE2 receptor, was calculated as: % Inhibition = (1-(OD sample/OD

reductions in the sVNT assay.

Monoclonal antibodies CR3022 (human IgG1 anti-S1-RBD(39);

InvivoGen) and 6G9 (human:mouse chimeric IgG anti-N; Amsbio) were used as calibrators for SARSCoV-2 antibody concentrations.
Data analysis. ANOVA, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and
Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) values were calculated. Comparisons among and between groups were
made using one-sided ANOVA or two-sided t-tests using GraphPad Prism.

Figure 1. Serum antibody responses distinguish convalescent, RT-PCR-confirmed, SARS-CoV-2infected patients from controls. A. Sera were collected from: i) 106 healthy subjects prior to March
2019 (Pre-pandemic Controls); ii) 137 healthy subjects between March and June 2020 (Post-pandemic
Controls) and iii) 69 RT-PCR-confirmed convalescent patients (PCR+) at least 31 days post-symptom
onset (DPSO). Each serum sample was diluted 1:500 and then measured for the presence of anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies: N, S1, S1-RBD and S1-NTD. Secondary antibodies were a combination of PEconjugated anti-IgA, anti-IgG, and anti-IgM (top row) or each individually (rows 2-4, respectively). Net
MFI is the mean fluorescence intensity with background subtracted. Horizontal, red, dashed lines indicate
the diagnostic cut-off (C0) values determined as the mean of the pre-pandemic population net MFI + 3
standard deviations. Significant differences between populations were determined by one-way ANOVA
and Tukey’s tests: * p<0.05; ** p<0.01; *** p<0.001; **** p<0.0001; p>0.05 not shown. B) Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare diagnostic potential of each SARS-CoV-2
antigen and antibody combination. The 69 RT-PCR-confirmed convalescent patients were compared
against the 106 pre-pandemic healthy control subjects. Diagonal, dashed, red lines represent the predicted
behavior when the test has no diagnostic value. The area-under-the-curve (AUC) measurement provides
an index of diagnostic potential. AUC near 0.5 suggest no diagnostic value and AUC near 1.0 indicate
strong diagnostic potential. Antigen:isotype combinations that yielded AUC values greater than 0.90 are
highlighted in green.

ROC curves distinguish severe/critical and mild/moderate SARS-CoV-2 infections

during convalescence. ROC curves were used to compare serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses
between the 19 severe/critical and 50 mild/moderate infected patients (from Fig. 3) during convalescence.
Diagonal, dashed, red lines represent the predicted behavior when the test has no diagnostic value. The
area-under-the-curve (AUC) measurements provides an index of potential diagnostic utility: AUC near
0.5 suggest no diagnostic value; AUC values near 1.0 indicate strong diagnostic potential. Antigen:isotype
combinations that yielded AUC values greater than 0.90 are highlighted in green.

Average net MFI was calculated for mild/moderate and severe/critical patients in 15-, 30-, and 60-day
intervals over a five-month period post symptom onset. T-tests of significance were performed to
compare the two groups at each time interval. Significant differences decreased between the two groups
over time.
