ABSTRACT
Background: ​Researchers are generating molecular data pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
genome and its proteins at an unprecedented rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result,
there is a critical need for rapid and continuously updated access to the latest molecular data in
a format in which all data can be quickly cross-referenced and compared. We adapted our
genome browser visualization tool to the viral genome for this purpose. Molecular data, curated
from published studies or from database submissions, are mapped to the viral genome and
grouped together into “annotation tracks” where they can be visualized along the linear map of
the viral genome sequence and programmatically downloaded in standard format for analysis.
Results: ​The UCSC Genome Browser for SARS-CoV-2 (​https://genome.ucsc.edu/covid19.html​)
provides continuously updated access to the mutations in the many thousands of SARS-CoV-2
genomes deposited in GISAID and the international nucleotide sequencing databases,
displayed alongside phylogenetic trees. These data are augmented with alignments of bat,
pangolin, and other animal and human coronavirus genomes, including per-base evolutionary
rate analysis. All available annotations are cross-referenced on the virus genome, including
those from major databases (PDB, RFAM, IEDB, UniProt) as well as up-to-date individual
results from preprints. Annotated data include predicted and validated immune epitopes,
promising antibodies, RT-PCR and sequencing primers, CRISPR guides (from research,
diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies), and points of interaction between human and viral genes.
As a community resource, any user can add manual annotations which are quality checked and
shared publicly on the browser the next day.
Conclusions: ​We invite all investigators to contribute additional data and annotations to this
resource to accelerate research and development activities globally. Contact us at
genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu​ with data suggestions or requests for support for adding data.
Rapid sharing of data will accelerate SARS-CoV-2 research, especially when researchers take
time to integrate their data with those from other labs on a widely-used community browser
platform with standardized machine-readable data formats, such as the SARS-CoV-2 Genome
Browser.

Introduction
The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Human Genome Browser ​(Kent et al., 2002)​ is
a web-based, interactive viewer for the human and other vertebrate genome sequences
featuring research data, clinical molecular data, annotations, and sequence alignments that has
been used for almost 20 years by hundreds of thousands of biomedical researchers and cited in
more than 37,500 scientific papers. To address the current COVID-19 epidemic, we have built a
similar browser for the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512v2, wuhCor1). The purpose
of this report is to introduce this tool to the international community racing to understand the
details of the virus, its evolution, its mechanisms of action in human cells, and its immunological
and molecular vulnerabilities.
A brief introduction to the Genome Browser
The SARS-CoV-2 browser displays the reference nucleotide sequence of the viral genome, and
provides an intuitive way to visualize annotations or data on specific parts of the genome
(Figure 1). The genome sequence is shown from left to right, 5’ to 3’, as an image with the label
“NC_045512.2”, which is the NCBI/INSDC accession ID for the reference sequence. This
reference sequence is the RNA genome isolated from one of the first cases in Wuhan and is
known as “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete
genome” ​(Wu et al., 2020)​. This sequence is widely used as a standard reference, and,
because of its early identification, it is used as the root genome in phylogenetic trees produced
by Nextstrain ​(Hadfield et al., 2018)​, The COG-UK ​(Rambaut et al., 2020)​ and the China
National Center for Bioinformation project ​(Zhao et al., 2020)​. Above this image are the
Navigation controls.​ Buttons in the navigation controls allow the user to move left and right
along the genomic sequence and zoom in and out by various factors. Clicking the zoom factor
“base” zooms in to show the nucleotide bases in the selected region. The ​Position Bar ​shows
the current region of the genome being viewed via a red box, and the ​Search Box​ allows a user
to manually enter a specific position to view. Coordinates in the Position Bar should be entered
with the prefix NC_045512v2 (the NCBI RefSeq accession of this genome) followed by the stop
and start nucleotide numbers (e.g. “NC_045512v2:25,341-25,401”). Users can also directly
enter a nucleotide sequence, or the name of a gene (corresponding to the NCBI/INSDC
annotation), to go directly to that region of the genome.
Genome annotations are shown underneath the Position Bar. At the top of the annotations the
genome sequence is shown (when zoomed in) as an ​RNA Sequence.​ At the time of this writing
there are 48 tracks with different kinds of molecular information of which 11 are shown by
default. The small ​grey buttons​ on the left of the image are the ​track configuration​ buttons
which allow users to configure the way track information is displayed. Alternatively, users can
also ​right-click ​to configure the track.

Figure 1:​ A
​ quick overview of the UCSC Genome Browser user interface structure​. Navigation
controls at the top allow users to move left and right and to zoom. The Position Bar shows a highlighted
red box illustrating the current portion of the genome being viewed. The Search Box allows users to
search for particular features or to move to exact genomic coordinates. The RNA sequence is only shown
when sufficiently zoomed in. Annotations are shown for data tracks that have been set to visible. Here,
the NCBI Genes track shows the annotation of the end of the Spike (S) protein and the start of ORF3a, as
well as the amino acid translation of their codons. Below that a track showing recurrent SARS-CoV-2
variants that have been observed around the world as reported by nextstrain.org. Bar graphs show the
frequency of each allele and mouseover gives the counts of each allele. The next track (Bat CoV multiz)
shows a multiple alignment of 44 bat coronaviruses aligned to the reference. Overall these viruses align
well to this region of SARS-CoV-2 (the dot means the amino acid is identical) although one
non-synonymous substitution (S1261P) is observed in one virus, Rs9401. The final track shows a CD8
positive epitope from IEDB (see Figure 7 for additional details). Tracks can be configured with a right-click
or alternatively by clicking on their name near the bottom of the page. Only 12 of the 48 currently
available track configuration buttons are shown in this figure due to space limitations. Custom data tracks
generated by users can be added directly via the “add custom tracks” button. Additional options can be
set via the Menu bar at the top (e.g. the “View” menu allows additional changes to the browser window).
(Live interactive session for this figure: ​http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure1​)

Under the genome sequence on the image, ​gene and protein annotations​ are shown by
default as blue rectangles, with the direction of transcription indicated by small arrows. If
activated, additional tracks displaying ​alignments​ and ​variants​ are shown underneath.
Under the annotations display, various buttons allow users to ​reset​ the currently shown tracks
back to the defaults. There are two buttons, ​add custom tracks​ and ​track hubs ​(Raney et al.,
2014)​, that allow experienced users to ​add their own data​. The ​configure​ button allows users
to make viewing adjustments (e.g. increase the font size). The ​reverse ​button reverse
complements the display to show the antisense sequence from 3’ to 5’ and the ​resize ​button fits
the image to the current screen size.

Below the buttons, the ​track list ​shows all available tracks (the first 12 are shown in Figure 1).
In order to provide a compact display, most tracks are hidden by default. For example, in Figure
1, only 4 of the more than 50 currently available tracks are visible. Hovering the mouse over the
title of a track for a few seconds will reveal a longer description of the track data. Clicking the
title of the track will show a full description and configuration page for that track data. On this
page, or in the track list, tracks can be set to one of the four visibility modes: ​dense​, ​squish​,
pack​ and ​full​ (Figure 2). Depending on the track, different viewing modes may emphasize
features of the data not immediately apparent in other modes (e.g. in Figure 2 individual ORFs
are hidden in “dense”, and names are hidden in “squish”) . In general, setting a track to “pack” is
a good starting point to explore the data.

Figure 2: The four visibility modes of annotation tracks.​ Four different ways to display the protein
products of the viral genome. Shown here are the “UniProt full-length proteins” track from the UniProt
track collection. “Dense” mode shows a single line highlighting any base that carries an annotation, while
“squish”, “pack” and “full” expand the annotations in more detail but use more screen space. (Live

Genomic Organization of SARS-CoV-2
The reference SARS-CoV-2 genome is a single strand of 29,903 RNA nucleotides, yet it, like
many viral genomes, encodes a surprising amount of molecular complexity, generating ~10
canonical RNA transcripts, ~14 ORFs, and ~29 proteins. This complex organization has several
features that are atypical for standard genomic analyses and therefore a careful understanding
of genomic annotations and viral nomenclature is necessary to accurately interpret the data on
the genome browser.
The SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome
Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA, and shares
many features with the mRNA of most human genes, including 5’ and 3’ UTRs as well as a
3’-poly-A tail ​(Chen et al., 2020)​. In infected cells, the first gene (orf1a/orf1ab) is directly
translated and cleaved into proteins that form the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs)
(Nakagawa et al., 2016)​ . These RTCs then use the same positive-strand RNA genome as a
template to generate negatively stranded RNAs that will serve as templates for additional
positive-strand mRNAs. During negative-strand transcription, RTCs will occasionally encounter
a body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-B). These occur at various positions within the
viral genome. These sequences work in combination with a single leader transcription
regulatory sequence (TRS-L) at the 5’ end of the genome. When RTCs encounter a TRS-B
sequence, they can “jump” to the TRS-L sequence, thereby generating a negative-strand RNA
that omits a large portion of the genome (Figure 3) ​(Sola et al., 2015)​. These negative-strand
RNAs then serve as templates for transcription of positive-strand subgenomic mRNAs. .
Positive-strand subgenomic RNAs created by this mechanism now have downstream AUGs in
an optimal start codon context, allowing ribosomes to initiate translation at locations normally
not available in the full length genomic RNA. These subgenomic RNAs serve as mRNAs for viral
proteins encoded downstream in the genome.
On the SARS-CoV-2 browser we have included a transcriptome track which annotates each
predicted TRS site in the reference genome using the presence of the motif ACGAAC, the
reported core TRS for SARS-CoV ​(Yount et al., 2006)​. The track also includes the canonical
mRNA produced from the full length positive-strand RNA, as well as the sub-genomic mRNAs
produced by TRS-B to TRS-L “jumps” that have been experimentally validated by transcriptomic
sequencing ​(Kim et al., 2020)​. Although discontinuous transcription is mechanistically quite
distinct from eukaryotic splicing, we annotate the “jump” from a TRS-B to the TRS-L in a manner
analogous to introns, as this allows proper interpretation of the transcript. In addition, we have

included annotations of several recently reported experimentally observed sub-genomic RNAs,
some of which have non-canonical junctions ​(Kim et al., 2020)​. As the SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome continues to be elucidated, we will update and add appropriate tracks. (Note in
press: we are currently adding similar data from ​(Nomburg et al., 2020)​ ).

Figure 3:​ M
​ olecular and Genomic Visualizations of SARS-CoV-2 Transcription on the browser.​ A)
SARS-CoV-2 produces mRNAs by discontinuous transcription. First replication-transcription complexes
(RTCs) initiate generation of (-) RNA strand (red strand) from the positive strand (black). When RTCs
encounter a body transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-B) they have a chance to “jump” to the
TRS-Leader (TRS-L) via long range RNA-RNA interactions. Alternatively they can proceed as usual
transcribing along the genome. The jumping process generates several different species of (-) RNA
strands that lack sequence between the various TRS-B sequences and the TRS-L. These (-) strands
then serve as templates for positive transcription from the TRS-L to generate a variety of viral mRNAs
that produce different viral proteins. B) A simple, compact and machine-readable genomic visualization

for this complex biological process. (Top) All viral mRNA species are shown as annotations on the
reference genome. Black bars represent nucleotides present in an mRNA species while arrows represent
the sequence that has been skipped during discontinuous transcription. Thick black bars represent the
coding sequence predicted to be translated in these RNA species. (Middle) The core TRS motif,
ACGAAC, annotated on the genome, corresponds to transcript junctions. (Bottom) Experimental data

directly upstream of the annotated bases in viral RNAs. The majority of these breakpoints correlate with
TRS-B motifs. (Live Interactive Session: h
​ ttp://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure3​)

The SARS-CoV-2 proteome
SARS-CoV-2 proteome consists of 2 polyproteins, 4 structural proteins, and possibly 9
accessory proteins ​(Brian & Baric, 2005; Fehr & Perlman, 2015; Wu et al., 2020)​. The two
polyproteins are processed into 16 non-structural proteins, leading to as many as 29 proteins
that should be considered when performing analyses (Figure 4).
Proteins pp1a and pp1ab are polyproteins that are products of ORF1a and ORF1ab respectively
which are both produced by translation of the full length genomic RNA. To generate pp1a the
ribosome initiates translation at the AUG at nucleotides 266-268. Translation continues in the
canonical manner until a UAA stop codon is encountered at nucleotides 13,481-13,483. That
produces the 4405 amino acid pp1a polyprotein. This polyprotein contains within itself two viral
proteases (nsp3/PL-PRO) and (nsp5/3CL-PRO) that cleave the pp1a polyprotein into 11 mature
non-structural proteins (nsp1-11, see Figure 4) ​(Barretto et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,
2020)​(Barretto et al., 2005).

Figure 4: Cleavage of viral polyproteins.​ (Above) Browser track showing all annotated viral ORFs from
the NCBI Genes track. Below the ORFs are the mature protein products that result from cleavage of the
viral polyproteins by the viral proteases nsp3/PL-PRO and nsp5/3CL-PRO, as well as a track showing
annotated cleavage sites. Also shown are two sites in the S (Spike) protein (furin_like_cleavage and
fusion_peptide_cleavage) that are recognized by host cellular proteases instead of the above two viral
proteases. Cleavage of coronavirus Spike protein generates mature subunits that allow the virus to enter
cells. (Below) Cartoon representation showing abstractly the cleavage of polyprotein peptide sequences
by the viral proteases to generate mature proteins. The viral polyproteins are cleaved by the PL-PRO
protease at 3 locations that match the amino acid pattern LXGGX (X = any amino acid) as indicated;
3CL-PRO cleaves many more sites, typically at the pattern LQSAG as shown. (Live Interactive Session:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure4​)

The pp1ab polyprotein is generated by initiating translation at the same start codon as pp1a;
however, the viral RNA contains within it a “slippery” sequence and structured RNA element that
occasionally causes the translation machinery to slip near nucleotide C13468 and therefore
read this nucleotide twice: once as the final nucleotide in the AAC codon for amino acid N4401,

and once again as the first nucleotide in the CGG codon for amino acid R4402) ​(Bekaert &
Rousset, 2005; Plant & Dinman, 2006)​. The result is a “programmed” -1 frameshift that means
the pp1a “stop” codon is no longer in frame, lengthening pp1ab by 2695 entirely different amino
acids. These additional amino acids encode essential non-structural proteins, (Figures 3 and 4),
meaning that pp1ab encodes nsp1-10 as well as nsp12-16. In order to properly display this
frameshift on the genome browser, we use specialized colored codons that lead to faithful
translation of each ORF (Figure 5).

Figure 5: Orf1a/Orf1ab Ribosomal Frameshifting.​ A) Genome Browser annotations detailing
translation of orf1a and orf1ab via ribosomal frameshifting. The red highlighted C is read twice by the
ribosome due to the upstream poly-U tract and downstream frameshifting RNA structure annotated in the
RFAM and RNA predictions track. Predicted base pairing reported by Ragan et al., 2020 and putative
secondary structures are visible upon clicking on annotations. Note that tertiary interactions are not
shown. (Live Interactive Session: ​http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure5)​ B) Schematic
representation of ribosomal frameshifting to generate distinct protein products from ORF1a and ORF1ab.
After the AAC in the A site of the ribosome recognizes its cognate tRNA, N4401 is added to the nascent
peptide and the ribosome prepares to move N4401 to the P site of the ribosome and read the next codon
at the A site of the ribosome. Normally this will occur canonically (above) with the ribosome moving +3
nucleotides on the mRNA (GGG) leading to addition of G4402 and normal translation of pp1a. However,
occasionally (~10% of the time in SARS-CoV reporter constructs (​ Plant & Dinman, 2006)​) the ribosome
will slip due to the highly structured frameshifting element (depicted here as a simple cartoon stem loop)

with the bound tRNAs slipping -1 nucleotide, and causing C13468 to remain in the A site of the ribosome.
This results in +2 movement along the mRNA and an overall -1 frameshift. Therefore the next codon
read is CGG and R4402 is added. Since the pp1a stop codon at 4406 is no longer in frame, ~2700
additional amino acids encoding nsp12-16 are added to the polyprotein.

The remaining proteins are produced through traditional ribosomal recognition of AUG
sequences on sub-genomic RNAs as shown in Figure 3. Of particular interest is the Spike
protein (S), which is the target of most immune-based therapies, governs the entry of the virus
into the cell and is cleaved by host proteases as described in Figure 4. Other therapeutic targets
include the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein that makes copies of the viral RNA
genome (also known as Pol/nsp12), the virally encoded proteases 3CL-PRO and PL-PRO, the
viral envelope protein E, and membrane protein M, and the nucleocapsid protein N, which
organizes the RNA genome of the virus in viral particles.
SARS-CoV-2 has at least 5 accessory proteins encoded by ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b,
and ORF8. Additional accessory ORFs, not in the NCBI and Uniprot SARS-CoV-2 annotations,
have been observed in other coronaviruses (ORF3b, ORF9b, ORF9c), although it is not clear
whether these ORFs produce functional proteins in SARS-CoV-2 ​(Gordon et al., 2020;
Schaecher & Pekosz, 2010)​. Additionally, ORF10, present in most annotation sets, has little
experimental support as a protein-coding gene. ​(Davidson et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020)​. A
variety of variant ORFs have also been recently reported by non-canonical sub-genomic
mRNAs ​(Nomburg et al., 2020)​.
An overview of SARS-CoV-2 genome annotation tracks
We provide several standard annotation tracks based on molecular data generated by
experimental and computational analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. These annotations are
sorted into groups as described below.
Mapping and Sequencing​: Tracks in this group are all based on short segments of local
nucleotide composition. For instance, users can immediately analyze inherent features of the
sequence such as GC-content, and DNA restriction enzyme recognition sites. We have also
added tracks that are specific for this viral genome: Covid-19 qPCR primers from WHO-listed
detection kits ​(​Open COVID-19​, 2020)​, Nanopore sequencing primers from the ARTIC Network
(​artic-ncov​, 2019)​ and high-scoring and validated Cas13 CRISPR guides ​(Abbott et al., 2020;
Wessels et al., n.d.)​. The Crowd-sourced annotations track (see below) contains CRISPR
guides used in SARS-CoV-2 detection via Cas12 ​(Broughton et al., 2020)​, and Cas13 ​(Metsky
et al., 2020; Wessels et al., 2020)​, a
​ s well as LAMP primers from various sources, e.g. ​(Park et
al., 2020)​. These tracks can be used in combination with the Variants tracks to determine if
specific primers or detection methods might be less effective at detecting certain viral clades
(Figure 6).

Figure 6: Variation in regions covered by CRISPR guides and PCR primers.​ Browser view of a
portion of the viral genome coding for the S protein. CRISPR guide sequences for two Cas13-based
detection kits developed by the Broad Institute (​ Metsky et al., 2020)​ and NYU are visible. Also visible is
the right (3’ end) primer of primer-pair number 73 for whole genome assembly using the nanopore
protocol from the ​ARTIC network​ Version 3. Although the Variants track reports three mutations in this
region, non-reference alleles have been observed only 7 (C>T), 2(G>T), and 2(A>T) times in 4353
sequences (observed when mousing over, data not shown), suggesting that these regions are reasonable
targets for primers and guides. The 7 instances of C>T are not alarming. An excess of C>T mutations
from sequencing is observed throughout the viral genome, and is likely due to spontaneous deamination
of cytosine into uracil or APOBEC RNA editing ​(Simmonds, 2020)​ (Live Interactive Session:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure6​)

Genes and Gene Predictions​: These tracks contain information centered around the genes in
the viral genome, as illustrated in figures above. For instance, the NCBI Gene track contains
annotations of viral gene models from NCBI. As viral genes often have many names (e.g.
nsp12/RdRp/Pol), many of these tracks list synonyms or notes in additional fields (viewable
upon clicking an annotation) so that researchers can compare the annotations with the
nomenclature that they are most familiar with. Additional tracks contain information such as
interactions between viral proteins and human proteins from affinity-purification and
mass-spectrometry experiments (​ Gordon et al., 2020)​, PDB structures (Figure 7), and RFAM
and other predicted RNA structure annotations ​(Rangan et al., 2020)​ (Figure 5).
UniProt Protein Annotations: ​Protein annotations from SwissProt/UniProt ​(UniProt
Consortium, 2019)​ are an essential complement to the NCBI RefSeq gene annotations ​(Pruitt
et al., 2007)​ . These tracks display a variety of protein annotation data including: special
regions highlighted by SwissProt curators (e.g. the region of the S protein that binds the human
receptor protein ACE2, see Figure 8), the mature proteins that result from polypeptide cleavage
(Figure 4), as well as protein domains and sites of post-translational modification, such as
glycosylation (Figure 6) and phosphorylation sites.
Immunology: ​These tracks contain SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes from publications. Included
are epitopes that are predicted and/or validated to be immunogenic (Figure 7). The data

on conformational epitopes ​(Pinto et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020)​ (recorded in Crowd-sourced
annotations track, data not shown). These tracks also display epitopes recognized by
CD8-positive or CD4-positive T-cells when presented by HLA molecules on host cells ​(Grifoni et
al., 2020a; Poran et al., 2020)​. Where possible, the latter are organized according to the HLA
allele of the host used in their presentation. Note that the four structural proteins, Spike (S)
protein, the Membrane (M) protein, Envelope (E), and the Nucleocapsid protein (N) are the
most frequent targets of the host immune system ​(Fast et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020b)​ and
many of these datasets are restricted to one of these regions, usually the Spike protein. For the
track “CD8 RosettaMHC”, interactive 3D models from Rosetta are available after clicking on the
annotated epitope (​ Nerli & Sgourakis, 2020)​. We will continue to update this track group as
validation and identification of epitopes continues.

from the original Wuhan outbreak ​(Andersen et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020)​. Additional tracks display
peptides within the virus that are predicted to be immunogenic. It is clear that the D614G mutation is
contained within a predicted immunogenic peptide. Also shown is an annotated glycosylation site at
amino acid 616 (highlighted in aqua) which can affect epitope recognition. B) Structure of the Spike (PDB

complex with HLA-A*02:01. D614 (red) is nestled within the binding groove, leading to a hypothesis that
the G614 mutation may alter binding. Note that although browser-based comparisons of this data lend
insight into possible models for the increased frequency of G614, further evolutionary and experimental
analyses are required to make definitive statements about the functional consequences of this mutation.

Comparative Genomics: ​This group contains two tracks that show multiple alignments built
from sequences provided by NCBI/INSDC: 1) “119 Vertebrate CoVs”, an alignment of 119
sequences, most of which are human coronaviruses (though not necessarily SARS-CoV-2), with
various animal viruses and 2) “44 Bat CoVs”, an alignment of 44 various bat coronaviruses most
closely related to human SARS CoV-2. The mutations in the alignments are colored by their
effect on the protein (white: no difference, red:nonsynonymous, green:synonymous,
blue:noncoding, yellow:missing data due to unalignable, absent or unknown sequence).
Analysis of evolutionary rates derived from comparative genomics, including insertions and
deletions, can pinpoint functionally interesting sections of the viral genome. For instance,
comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with less pathogenic coronaviruses suggest features of the
genome that may be related to increased pathogenicity ​(Gussow et al., 2020)​. Features
identified in that analysis currently appear in the Crowd-sourced annotations track, but will
eventually be displayed in the Comparative Genomics group. Similarly, comparison of
coronaviruses across species and across host genomes can clearly illustrate evolutionary
features such as accelerated evolution at receptor-spike binding regions (Figure 8) ​(Demogines
et al., 2012)​.

Figure 8: Comparative Genomic Analyses of SARS-like Coronaviruses.​ A view of the “44 Bat CoVs”
track in the ACE2 binding region of the Spike protein. Red indicates a nonsynonymous change, green a
synonymous change, and pale yellow (occasionally with blue border) indicates regions where no
alignable sequence exists. The high divergence (red and pale yellow) in the amino acids within the ACE2
binding site (upper track) relative to those outside of the binding site is an indication of positive selection
within the binding site. The “Bat PhastCons” track immediately above the multiple alignment summarizes
per-base evolutionary rates for the nucleotide positions in the virus, light gray regions are more rapidly
evolving (less conserved) than the black (very conserved) regions. This region of S is expected to
experience selection as the ACE2 protein itself rapidly evolves between species in a “genetic arms race”
with viruses that use this site. (Live Interactive Session: ​http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/SARS_CoV2/Figure8a​)

Variant and Repeats: ​These tracks contain information on the variation and evolutionary
patterns observed in SARS-CoV-2 sequences from different samples taken over the world.
“NextstrainVars” (Figure 9) contains the time-stamped molecular phylogenetic tree produced by
the Nextstrain team ​(Hadfield et al., 2018)​ based on complete and quality-controlled viral
genomes from GISAID ​(Shu & McCauley, 2017)​. The tree is shown in pack and squish views.
Dense and full mode display the frequencies at which these variants are found (data not
shown). In the tree, samples are sorted according to their order in the JSON file produced by
Nextstrain describing the phylogenetic tree, and appear in different colors according to clades
identified by Nextstrain. Because data were collected by GISAID from labs all over the world the
mutation calls do contain occasional errors. To avoid noise in the display, tools are provided to
filter these data to show only the well-supported mutation calls. Additional filters allow users to
set thresholds for minor allele frequency and to display data for specific clades.

Figure 9: Phylogenetic Analyses of Clade-Specific Variation in SARS-CoV-2.​ SARS-CoV-2 mature
protein products are shown at the top of the display for context. Below that are three tracks containing
Nextstrain phylogenetic trees and clades for selected SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from samples
deposited in GISAID. Each row represents a single viral genome, black bars represent the presence of a
mutation in the genome submitted to GISAID compared to the reference at that genomic position. As
expected, many mutational patterns cluster with branches of the phylogenetic tree. The first track contains
data from all 4147 sequences available from Nextstrain as of April 30, 2020. Clades identified by
Nextstrain are colored by the same scheme used on the N
​ extstrain site.​ The middle track shows only
samples from the Nextstrain B clade (warm colors) with increased vertical resolution, and the bottom track
shows only samples from the Nextstrain B2 subclade of B (red-orange color) with even greater vertical
resolution. At this resolution the sample identifier and additional sample information become visible,
including time and location of the sample collection. (Live Interactive Session:

Custom tracks: ​ Users can add annotations for their own use or to share with other groups by
clicking the “Custom tracks” button. Annotation data can be pasted directly into a text box (e.g.
entering “NC_045512v2 509 515 binding-site” and clicking “Submit” will show an annotation at
the nucleotide position 510-515 with the label “binding-site”) or annotations can be uploaded in
a standard genomic file format. To share a custom track, users can create a link via the menu
“My Data > My Sessions” and share this link directly. Session links can be shared multiple times
and will always load the data exactly as originally saved.
Track Hubs:​ Track Hubs are similar to Custom Tracks but give the user more control over the
display and make managing large collections of tracks easier ​(Raney et al., 2014)​. The files are
hosted on a user’s web server and must be in binary formats such as BAM, VCF, bigBed or
bigWig. The user defines the display parameters in configuration files
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/hgTrackHubHelp.html). Track Hubs are displayed
alongside the native annotation tracks for that assembly. They appear under the hub's own track
group on the main browser page. Track Hubs of sufficient general interest can be submitted for
inclusion in our public hubs list at https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgHubConnect#publicHubs.
Crowd-sourced data: ​To encourage shared community annotation of the viral genome without
requiring that the submitter have detailed knowledge of genomic data type formats, a
“Crowd-sourced annotations” track has been created. Its documentation includes a link
(​http://bit.ly/cov2annots​) to a spreadsheet where anyone can enter the start and end position of
some annotation, descriptive text and a link to a website or paper with the source information. A
special link on the track description page adds a version of the track with all changes from
today. Every night all new user annotations from the previous day undergo a brief manual check
and are added to the public “Crowd-sourced annotations” track.
Data Access for Programmers: ​We maintain a public MySQL server (top menu bar
“Downloads -> MySQL”) for accessing our annotation data and a JSON REST API (“Downloads
-> JSON API”). We encourage data creators to contact us with requests for help with data
conversion and about having their track hubs added to our list of public track hubs.
Outreach and Contact information: ​We offer free training for the Genome Browser over video
calls. Outreach is supported by updates to the training documentation
(https://genome.ucsc.edu/training/) with links to videos and in-depth descriptions of new
Browser features. The training page includes information on how to submit a request for a
webinar. General contact information for the UCSC Genome Browser can be found at
https://genome.ucsc.edu/contacts.html, including information for accessing our email support
list.

Discussion
The rapid pace of SARS-CoV-2 research is generating a wealth of molecular and genomic data
across a variety of databases. The UCSC Genome Browser is an established and
highly-accessed web-based viewer and standardized repository of genomic data with extensive
functionality and a 20 year track record of serving the genomics community. Here, we
demonstrate the utility of this genomic viewing and downloading environment for the
visualization and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 molecular data.
Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 browser has more than 50 tracks of various kinds of data, ​from
gene annotations to phylogenetic trees of thousands of viral sequences. These data can be
analyzed together in combinations chosen by the user to see named viral clades and keep track
of viral strains as they emerge, gain easy access to both protein and RNA structures, survey
predicted and validated immune epitopes, reveal mutational patterns in these immune epitopes,
study glycosylation patterns that may affect antibody recognition, find locations of PCR primers
and CRISPR guides and mutations that may affect them, compare SARS-CoV-2 to other viruses
and analyze evolutionary patterns suggesting functional importance for particular regions, and
to perform a variety of other analyses. We have carefully enhanced the display of certain
annotations - such as the viral RNA’s ribosomal frameshift element - so that the browser
correctly handles genomic features that are uncommon in most non-viral genomes, yet at the
same time maintains reliable programmatic data access and automatic data updates.
The browser, and its underlying data organization, is a familiar environment for hundreds of
thousands of biomedical researchers who use the human genome, allowing these scientists to
download standardized data formats from a single source for custom analyses. Here we hope to
also introduce these tools to virologists, epidemiologists, vaccinologists, antiviral therapy
developers, and those seeking to repurpose existing biomedical resources and therapies to
combat the virus and its pathological effects. In order to leverage the expertise of scientists who
lack familiarity with genomic analyses but possess expertise in other areas, we have developed
a “Crowd-Sourced Data” track in which users can simply enter the coordinates and name of a
feature. This annotation is then displayed and shared with others on the browser, where it will
be viewed and compared to the many existing data tracks. Together these features make the
SARS-CoV-2 browser a simple but powerful tool for researchers to track developments in
SARS-CoV-2 science, to detail the changes in the viral genome over the course of the
pandemic, and to develop testable hypotheses and novel strategies to combat it.
As scientists continue to generate SARS-CoV-2 data, we will continue to rapidly process,
display, and share these data on the ​SARS-CoV-2 browser​. We urge authors to contact us at
genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu​ ​for help in properly citing, annotating and displaying their data
in a clear, accurate, and intuitive manner on the browser so that it can reach the widest possible
audience of researchers. Through this type of open collaboration, we believe the ​SARS-CoV-2
browser will facilitate the analysis and display of the collective molecular information needed to
defeat the virus.
