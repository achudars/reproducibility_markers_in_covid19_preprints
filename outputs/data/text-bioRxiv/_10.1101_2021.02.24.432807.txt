Abstract
Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is a 180-residue protein that blocks translation of host mRNAs in SARSCoV-2-infected cells. Although it is known that SARS-CoV-2’s own RNA evades nsp1’s
host translation shutoff, the molecular mechanism underlying the evasion was poorly
understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to
investigate the mechanism of the viral RNA evasion. Simulation results showed that the
stem loop structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5’-untranslated region (SL1) is recognized
by both nsp1’s globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The recognition

presumably enables selective translation of viral RNAs. Cluster analysis of the binding
mode and detailed analysis of the binding poses revealed several residues involved in
the SL1 recognition mechanism. The simulation results imply that the nsp1 C-terminal
helices are lifted from the 40S ribosome upon the binding of SL1 to nsp1, unblocking
translation of the viral RNA.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) belongs to Betacoronaviridae, and is the causative pathogen of COVID-19. Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) resides at
the beginning of SARS-CoV-2’s genome, and it is the first protein translated upon SARSCoV-2 infection. After self-cleavage of open reading frame 1a (orf1a) by an orf1a-encoded
protease (nsp3; PLpro), nsp1 is released as a 180-residue protein. SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 is
homologous to nsp1 of SARS-CoV-1, the causative pathogen of SARS, sharing 84 % sequence identity with the SARS-CoV-1 protein. Nsp1 functions to suppress host gene expression 1–6 and induce host mRNA cleavage, 1,2,7,8 effectively blocking translation of host
mRNAs. The translation shutoff hinders the host cell’s innate immune response icluding
interferon-dependent signaling. 1,9 Multiple groups have recently reported cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1–40S ribosome complexes. 10–12 The
structural analysis showed that two α-helices are formed in the C-terminal region (153-160,
166-179) of nsp1 and binds to the 40S ribosome. These helices block host translation by
shutting the ribosomal tunnel used by the mRNA. This blockade inhibits formation of the
48S ribosome pre-initiation complex, which is essential for translation initiaion. 3,12 But while
nsp1 shuts down host mRNA translation, it is nown that the viral RNAs are translated even
in the presence of the nsp1, and that they evade degradation. 2–4
These mechanisms force infected cells to produce only viral proteins instead of normal
host cell proteins; indeed, in a transcriptome analysis, 65 % of total RNA reads from Vero
cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were mapped to the viral genome. 13 It has also been shown

that nsp1 recognizes the 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of the viral RNA 4,6,11 and selectively enables translation of RNAs that have a specific sequence. The first stem loop in the
5’-UTR 4,6,14 has been shown to be necessary for translation initiation in the presence of nsp1.
Specifically, with SARS-CoV-1, 4 bases 1-36 of the 5’-UTR enable translation of viral RNA;
with SARS-CoV-2, bases 1-33 14 or 1-40 6 of the 5’-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 enable translation.
However, the precise molecular mechanism remains poorly understood.
In the present research, therefore, our aim was to describe the detailed mechanism by
which SARS-CoV-2 RNA evades nsp1. We modeled and simulated a complex complsed of
SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and the SARS-CoV-2 5’-UTR’s first stem loop using an extended ensemble
molecular simulation. A detailed analysis of the simulation suggests the molecular basis of
nsp1 recognition of the 5’-UTR, whereby interaction of nsp1 and the stem loop prevents
nsp1’s C-terminal helices from binding to the ribosomal tunnel.

Methods
Simulation setup. We constructed a complex of nsp1 and 5’-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Nsp1 is a partially disordered 180-residue protein, in which the structures of residues 12127 and 14-125 have been solved by X-ray crystallography in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
respectively. The structures of other residues (1-11, 128-180) are unknown, and residues
130-180 are thought to be an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). 15,16 We constructed
the SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 structure using homology modeling based on the SARS-CoV-1 nsp1
conformation (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 2HSX 15 ). Modeling was performed using
MODELLER. 17 We noted that SARS-CoV-1 nsp1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 are aligned without
gaps. The structure of the IDR was constructed so as to form an extended structure. For
nsp1, we used the AMBER ff14SB force field 18–21 in the subsequent simulations.
The initial structure of the RNA stem was constructed using RNAcomposer. 22,23 Bases
numbered 1-35 from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NCBI reference sequence ID NC 045512.2) 24

were used in the present research. This sequence corresponds to the first stem loop of the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5’-UTR. Hereafter, we will call this RNA “SL1.” SL1 was capped by
7-methyl guanosine triphosphate (m7G-ppp-). The first base (A1) after the cap was methylated at the 2’-O position to reflect the viral capped RNA. Charges and bonded force field
parameters for these modified bases were respectively prepared using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) method 25 and analogy to existing parameters. For SL1, we used a
combination of AMBER99 + bsc0 + χOL3. 18,19,26,27 To maintain the structural stability of
the stem loop, we employed distance restraints between the G-C bases. Specifically, between
residues G7–C33, G8–C32, C15–G24 and C16–G23, distance restraints were applied such
that the distances between the N1, O6 and N2 atoms of guanosine and the N3, N4 and O2
atoms of cytidine, did not exceed 4.0 Å. Between these atoms, flat-bottom potentials were
applied, where each potential was zero when the distance between two atoms was less than

4.0 Å, and a harmonic restraint with a spring constant of 1 kJ mol−1 A

−2

was applied when

it exceeds 4.0 Å. We used acpype 28 to convert the AMBER force field files generated by
AmberTools 29 into GROMACS.
The nsp1 and SL1 models were then merged and, using TIP3P 30 water model with JoungCheatham monovalent ion parameters 31 (73,468 water molecules, 253 K ions, 209 Cl ions),
were solvated in 150 mM KCl solution. The initial structure is presented in Fig. 1A. A
periodic boundary condition using a rhombic dodecahedron unit cell was used with a size of
ca. 140 Å along the X-axis. Note that we started the simulation from the unbound state;
that is, nsp1 and SL1 were not directly in contact with each other. The total number of
atoms in the system was 224,798.
Although it is possible to perform a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of an nsp1-SL1
complex, due to the excessive charges on both molecules, the model tends to be trapped
around the initial configuration of the complex in conventional MD simulations. Authors
have previously shown that the sampling for nucleic acid–protein systems can be effectively
solved by extended ensemble simulations. 32–34 In this work, we used replica exchange with

solute tempering (REST) version 2 to sample various configurations of SL1 and the nsp1
IDR. 35 We set both the disordered region (nsp1 1-11 and 128-180) and the entire SL1 as
the “hot” region of the REST2 simulation. Note that in addition to the charge scaling for
nsp1 and SL1, we also scaled the charges of counter-ions to prevent unneutralized system
charge in the Ewald summation. The total number of replicas used in the simulation was
192. The replica numbered 0 corresponds to the simulation with the unscaled potential. In
the final replica (numbered 191), nonbonded potentials between “hot”-“hot” groups were
scaled by 0.25. Exchange ratios were 53-78 % across all replicas. To prevent numerical
errors originating from the loss of significant digits, we used a double-precision version of
GROMACS as the simulation software. 36 We also modified GROMACS to enable the replica
exchange simulation with an arbitrary Hamiltonian. 37 The patch representing modifications
is supplied in the supporting information.
The simulation was performed for 50 ns (thus, 50 ns×192 = 9.6 µs in total), and the first
25 ns were discarded as an equilibration time. The simulation was performed with NVT
and the temperature was set to 300 K. The temperature was controlled using the velocity
rescaling method. 38 The timestep was set to 2 fs, and hydrogens attached to heavy atoms
were constrained with LINCS. 39

Simulation analysis. To obtain the proper structural ensemble under the unmodified
potential function, we used the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio (MBAR) method. 40,41
With that method, we obtained a weighted ensemble corresponding to the canonical ensemble
(trajectory with a weight assigned on each frame) from multiple simulations performed with
different potentials. Only eight replicas corresponding to the eight lowest replica indices (i.e.,
the one with the unscaled potential function and seven replicas with the potentials closest
to the unscaled potential) were used in the MBAR analysis. The weighted ensemble of the
trajectory was used in the subsequent analyses. The ensemble of structures with the weight
information is available online at https://bsma.pdbj.org/entry/26. Visualization was

performed using VMD 42 and pymol. 43 The secondary structure of nsp1 was analyzed using
the secondary structure definition of DSSP 44 with mdtraj. 45 We tested the convergence of
the ensemble using the secondary structure distribution and the stability of the hydrogen
bonds between nsp1 and SL1 (see the supplementary material for details).

Interactions between nsp1-SL1. We applied three criteria to detect interactions between nsp1 and SL1. (i) Inter-residue contacts were detected with the criterion that the
inter-atomic distance between the Cα of an amino acid residue and C4’ of a nucleotide
residue was less than or equal to 12 Å. (ii) Hydrogen bonds were detected with the criteria
that the hydrogen-acceptor distance was less than 2.5 Å and the donor–hydrogen–acceptor
angle was greater than 120 degrees. (iii) Salt-bridges were detected with the criterion that
the distance between a phosphorous atom in the RNA backbone and the distal nitrogen
atom of Arg or Lys was less than 4.0 Å.

Clustering. On the basis of the inter-residue contact information, the binding modes of
the nsp1–SL1 complex observed in the ensemble were evaluated by applying the clustering
method. The inter-residue contact information in each snapshot was represented as a contact
map consisting of a 180 × 36 binary matrix. The distance between two snapshots was
then calculated as the Euclidian distance of vectors with 180 × 36 = 6480 elements. We
applied the DBSCAN method 46 to classify the binding modes. We arbitrarily determined
two parameters, eps and minPts, for the DBSCAN method to obtain a reasonable number
of clusters each of which had distinct binding modes. Note that the DBSCAN generates
clusters each of which has more than minPts members based on the similarity threshold
eps. The clusters with fewer than minPts members (including singletons) were treated as
outliers. We used eps = 6 and minPts = 200 in this research. We also tested another
clustering algorithm, OPTICS, 47 and confirmed that the two different methods generate
qualitatively similar results (data not shown).

Results and discussion
The IDR partially forms secondary structure and binds to SL1. Although we did
not restrain the RNA-nsp1 distance in the simulation and started the simulation with the
two molecules apart, they formed a complex within the canonical ensemble. Figure 1 (B)
shows a representative snapshot of the complex at the end of the simulation. The RNA
stem binds to the C-terminal disordered region. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (C), when the
N-terminal domain of nsp1 was superimposed, the RNA structures did not have a specific
conformation. This implies that there was no distinct, rigid structure mediating nsp1-RNA
binding.
We next investigated the secondary structure of the nsp1 region. Although we started
the simulation from an extended configuration, the C-terminal region at residues 153-179
partially formed two α-helices, which is consistent with the fact that the C-terminal region
forms two helices (residues 153-160, 166-179) and shuts down translation by capping the pore
that mRNA goes through in the Cryo-EM structural analysis. The result also indicates that
the cap structure may be formed before nsp1 binds to the ribosome, reflecting a pre-existing
equilibrium, although the ratio of the helix-forming structures is only up to 50%. In addition
to these known helices, residues 140-150 also weakly formed a mixture of α-helix and 3-10
helix. Residues at other regions (1-11, 128-139) remained disordered.

Distance between the nsp1 N-terminal domain and C-terminal helices. Recent
cryo-EM structures suggest that the N-terminal domain of nsp1 reside on the 40S ribosome,
though the density map is ambigous (Fig. 3). Inspired by the structures, we investigated the
geometric restraints on nsp1 in the presence of SL1. The distance between the center-of-mass
of the nsp1 N-terminal domain (defined by residues 14-125) and that of the C-terminal helices
(residues 153-179) was calculated and its histogram is plotted in Fig. 3(C). The distance
distribution had two peaks at 27 and 33 Å, which is below 49.8 Å estimated from the cryoEM structure (see supporting information for details). Indeed, 90.7% of the trajectory had

a distance less than the experimentally estimated distance of 49.8 Å. This indicates that the
configuration observed in the cryo-EM structure, which does not include SL1, is unlikely to
happen when nsp1 is complexed with the SL1.

SL1’s hairpin is recognized by the nsp1 IDR. Inter-residue contact probabilities
between nsp1 and SL1 in the canonical ensemble are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 4.
Based on the distribution of the interactions, we categorized the binding interface of nsp1 into
five regions (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Table S1): (i) the N-terminus (residues 1–18), (ii)
the α1 helix (residues 31–50), (iii) the disordered loop between β3 and β4 (residues 74–90),
(iv) the N-terminal side of the IDR (residues 121–146), and (v) the C-terminal side of the
IDR (residues 147–180). These five regions interacted primarily with bases around C20 of the
RNA fragments, which compose the stem loop. The most important region for recognition of
SL1 was region (iv), the N-terminal side of the IDR. The probability of contacts between any
residue in this region and SL1 was 97.4%. In particular, contact between Asn126 and U18
was observed in 84.1% of the canonical ensemble. The most frequently observed hydrogen
bond in the canonical ensemble was Arg124–U18, the probability of which was 26.0% (Table
1). The second most important interface region was region (ii), α1 helix, which has two basic
residues (Arg43 and Lys47), that frequently formed salt-bridges with the backbone of SL1.
At least one salt-bridge in this region was included in 69.8% of the canonical ensemble. The
third most important was region (iii), consisting of the loop between β3 and β4; 63.2 % of
the canonical ensemble included at least one contact in this region. Asp75 sometimes formed
hydrogen bonds with the bases of SL1. Regions (i) and (v) tended not to form hydrogen
bonds or salt-bridges, but frequently contacted residues in these regions; the probability for
interactions with regions (i) and (v) were 72.1% and 59.2%, respectively.
As an overall shape, the nsp1 surface consists of positive and negative electrostatic surface
patches separated by a neutral region (Fig. 6A). 48 The α1 helix in region (i) forms the
interface between these two patches; one side of the helix contains basic residues (Arg43

and Lys47), and the other side contains some hydrophobic residues (Val38, Leu39, Ala42,
and Leu46). The positive side of the α1 helix assumes a mound-like shape with a positively
charged cliff (Fig. 6(B)). The bottom of the valley formed by the N-terminus and β3-β4
loop, or regions (i) and (iii), respectively, also contains positive electrostatic potentials. The
positively charged cliff and valley attract and fit to the negatively charged backbone of SL1.
Eventually the IDRs in region (iv) and (v) grab SL1.
Although the binding site for SL1 on nsp1 can be characterized as an interface consisting
of regions (i) through (v), SL1 did not assume a stable conformation, even when it was bound
to these regions. Diverse binding modes were observed in the canonical ensemble. Although
SL1 nearly always interacted with residues in the region (iv), its conformation was diverse
and fluctuated greatly. In addition, the nsp1 IDR was also highly flexible.

Clustering analysis of the binding poses. The diversity of the binding modes was
further investigated using cluster analysis based on the contact map for each snapshot (see
the Methods section). We determined the clustering threshold using the criterion that any
cluster has at least one inter-residue contacts with more than 80 % in each cluster. As
a result, the binding modes could be categorized into 14 clusters and outliers, which had
34.2% of the statistical weight in the canonical ensemble. In even the most major cluster,
the statistical weight was only 15.5%; those for the second, third, and fourth clusters were
9.9%, 7.4%, and 5.0%, respectively. Each cluster had a unique tendency to use a set of
binding regions (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Figure S3). We also analyzed
the differences in surface areas of the interacting interfaces in the ordered and disordered
regions of nsp1 among the 14 clusters (Supplementary Figure S4). The distribution shows
the unique characteristics of each cluster. These results indicate that recognition of SL1 by
nsp1 is established by multimodal binding modes.
The representative structure of cluster 1, which had the largest population among all
clusters, is presented in Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table S3. Nsp1 recognized SL1 via re-

gions (ii), (iii) and (iv). In the region (ii), the basic residues in H2 formed the Arg43–C17
and Lys47–U16 salt-bridges.

Region (iii) recognized SL1 via the Asp75–U18 hydrogen

bond. Residues Arg124 through Gly137 in region (iv) attached to SL1 via the Arg124–U17,
Ala131–C19, and Ser135–C16 hydrogen bonds; Tyr136 stacks between C21 and G23 instead
of A22, which was flipped out. Representative structures of clusters 2 and 3 are also presented in the supporting material (Supplementary Figures S5 and S6 and Supplementary
Tables S4 and S5).

Model of the mechanism. Based on the simulation results, we suggest a model of the
mechanism in Fig. 8. Without SL1, both the N-terminal domain and C-terminal helices bind
to the 40S ribosome, blocking human mRNAs. With the SL1, the binding between SL1 and
nsp1 at both the N-terminal domain and part of the IDR results in the C-terminal helices
being pulled such that they can no longer maintain their binding to the 40S ribosome. The
5’-end of the viral RNA will then be loaded into the ribosome, initiating the translation.

Relation to other experimental results. It has been reported that the Arg124Ala–
Lys125Ala double nsp1 mutant lacks the ability to recognize viral RNA. 3 This can be explained by the results of our simulation, which showed that sidechain of Arg124 strongly
interacts with the phosphate backbone of U18 (Table 1 and Figs. 5 and 7). An Arg124Ala
mutation would eliminate the ionic interaction between the sidechain and the backbone, and
nsp1 would lose its ability to recognize viral RNA.
The circular dichroism spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 C-terminal region (residues
130-180) 16 in solution had only a single peak at 198 nm and did not show ellipticities at
208 nm and 222 nm. This indicates that the nsp1 C-terminal region did not form α-helices
or β-sheets and was disordered. Although in our simulation we found that nsp1 partially
forms the α-helix in the IDR, our simulation also indicated that the percentage of the helix
formed was low and the structure was unstable, which may explain the difference from the
experimental results. The difference may also be attributable to the presence of RNA and

other solvent conditions and the force field inaccuracies. Further study will be needed before
a conclusion can be drawn.
Whether SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and SL1 bind without the ribosome is controversial. It has
been reported that nsp1 and bases 7-33 of SARS-CoV-2 bind with a binding constant of
0.18 µM, 49 but it has also been reported that a gel shift does not occur with the 5’-UTR
of SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations up to 20 µM when tRNAs was used to exclude the nonspecific binding. 6 The present simulation results indicate that the binding mode observed
herein did not have a specific, defined structure. Typically, with such binding modes, the
binding is expected to be weak; we therefore do not think these simulation results contradict
the results from either of the aforementioned experiments.
Mutations to SL1 bases 14-25, which disrupt the Watson-Crick pairs of the stem loop,
reportedly cause translation to be shut off. 6 That observation is consistent with our finding
that the hairpin structure of bases 18-22 in SL1 is recognized by nsp1. Hydrogen-bond
interaction analysis showed that the RNA phosphate backbone is mainly recognized within
the C15-C20 region (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Moreover, our finding is consistent with the fact
that the sequence of the hairpin region (corresponding to U18-C21 in our simulation) is not
well conserved among SARS-CoV-2 mutational variants, whereas that of the stem is well
conserved. 50 Our simulation shows that the interaction between nsp1 and the SL1 backbone
is stronger than that between nsp1 and the SL1 sidechains (Table 1), which highlights the
importance of the backbone interaction.

Limitations of this study. Our simulation was performed based on several assumptions.
Here, we list the limitations of the present study.
First, our simulation was performed without the ribosome. This was mainly because
the simulation started before the structure of the nsp1-ribosome complex was deposited.
Furthermore, the orientation of the nsp1 N-terminal domain attached to the 40S ribosome is
still ambiguous in density maps. With the 40S ribosome, the environment around nsp1 may

be altered and so be the interaction between the RNA and nsp1. Specifically, the ribosome
consists mostly of ribosomal RNAs and are therefore strongly negatively charged, which may
change the interaction environment significantly.
To maintain the stability of the hairpin loop structure, we performed the simulation with
restraints on the G-C pairs in the 5’-UTR. These restraints may have hindered RNA forming
structures other than the initial hairpin structure. However, in the secondary structure prediction using CentroidFold, 51 these base pairs were predicted to exist in more than 92% of
the ensemble. Furthermore, a recent study 52 showed that, even with a rigorous extended ensemble simulation, the hairpin structure remained intact. Given these results, the drawback
of structural restraints to SL1 is expected to be minimal.
Finally, as is always the case with a simulation study, the mismatch between the simulation force field and the real world leaves a non-negligible gap. In addition, some residues
may have alternative protonation states upon binding to RNA (e.g., histidine protonation
state).

Future research and conclusions. The present simulation was performed with only
nsp1 and SL1. Arguably, simulation of a complex consisting of the 40S ribosome, nsp1 and
SL1 will be an important step toward further understanding the details of the mechanism
underlying the evasion of nsp1 by viral RNA. Our results show that nsp1-SL1 binding has
multimodal binding structures. The addition of the 40S ribosome to the system may restrict
the structure to a smaller number of possible binding poses and possibly tighter binding poses
may be obtained.
In addition to a simulation study, mutational analysis of nsp1 will be informative. In
addition to the already known mutation at Arg124, current simulation results predict Lys47,
Arg43, and Asn126 are important to nsp1-SL1 bninding. Mutation analyses of these residues
will help us to understand the molecular mechanism of nsp1.

the current pandemic. Although the present results imply that a specific binding structure
might not exist, important residues in nsp1 and bases in SL1 were detected. Blocking or
mimicking the binding of these residues/bases, could potentially nullify the function of nsp1.
In conclusion, using MD simulation, we investigated the binding and molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and the 5’-UTR stem loop of SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest
that the interaction between nsp1 and the 5’-UTR stem loop prevents the C-terminal helices
from binding to the ribosome, thereby avoiding translation shutoff. The interaction analysis
further revealed that the hairpin loop structure of the 5’-UTR stem loop is recognized by
both the N-terminal domain and the intrinsically disordered region of nsp1. Multiple binding poses were obtained, and the largest cluster of binding poses included interactions that
coincide with the results of the previous mutational analysis.

Figure 6: (A) Surface electrostatic potential of the nsp1 and (B) annotated surface structure
of the nsp1 recognition sites for SL1. In (A), units are in kB T /e, where kB is the Boltzmann
factor, T is the temperature of the system (= 300 K), and e is the unit charge of a proton.
Color coding in (B) corresponds to the region defined in Fig. 1 D.

Figure 8: Schematic model of the nsp1 translation shutoff evasion suggested by our simulation. (A) Without SL1, the C-terminal helices of nsp1 obstruct the tunnel for mRNA. (B)
With SL1, the N-terminal domain and the nsp1 IDR bind to SL1, and the C-terminal helices
dissociate from the ribosome, opening the tunnel to mRNA.
