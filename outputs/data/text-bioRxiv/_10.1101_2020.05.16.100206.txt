Abstract
With an increasing fatality rate, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)
has emerged as a promising threat to human health worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the
Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being
contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as
coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are
available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential
vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the
nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes
with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of
SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through
phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell
as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules. Further, molecular
docking analysis unveiled that NTASWFTAL possessed a greater affinity towards HLA and also
available in a greater range of the population. Our study provides a consolidated base for vaccine
design and we hope that this computational analysis will pave the way for designing novel
vaccine candidates.

Introduction

The present world has witnessed the outbreak of many life-threatening human pathogens
including Ebola, Chikungunya, Zika, Severe Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the 21st century. More
recently in late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in the city of Wuhan,
Hubei province, China which was of unknown cause. Later it was confirmed that these
pneumonia cases were due to a novel coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 (previously named as
2019-nCoV) and the disease condition of this virus is referred to as COVID-19 (1–3). On March
11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has assessed that COVID-19 can be
characterized as a pandemic. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a global concern and is
spreading at an alarming rate and as of April 12, 2020, more than 1.6 million cases and over
105,000 deaths have been reported globally (4).
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are phenotypically and genotypically diverse group viruses that can adapt
to the new environment through mutation and recombination, probably even more than
influenza. Coronaviruses often infect mammals, birds and can transmit to humans. Six strains of
coronaviruses were found in the last few decades but this is a completely new strain and of
zoonotic origin. COVID-19 virus belongs to the Coronaviridae family of the Genus
Betacoronavirus, pleomorphic or spherical particles, 150 to 160 nm in size, associated with
positive single-strand RNA (ssRNA) which is surrounded by crown-shaped, club-like spikes
projection on the outer surface. Among all RNA viruses, Coronaviruses have the largest genome
typically ranging from 27 to 32 kb. After the two previously reported coronavirus-SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV, this is the third coronavirus that has already infected humans and the
preliminary investigations revealed that some environmental specimens of the Huanan seafood

market in Wuhan were positive for COVID-19 (3). Although the seafood market was reckoned
positive for COVID-19, no specific association with an animal is confirmed yet based on the
WHO report. Researchers are working to establish a possible animal reservoir for COVID-19
(5).
As COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory disease, in most cases it might affect the lungs only. The
primary mode of infection is human-to-human transmission through close contact, which occurs
via spraying droplets from the infected individual through their cough or sneeze. The symptoms
of this coronavirus can be mild to moderate or severe including, fever, cough, and shortness of
breath or pneumonia. Respiratory, hepatic and neurological complications can be seen in case of
severe cases that can lead to death. It seems that the severity and fatality rate of COVID-19 is
milder than that of SARS and MERS. Although diarrhea was presented in about 20-25% of
patients with SARS and MERS, intestinal symptoms were rarely reported in patients with
COVID-19 (6–8). Multi-organ failure, especially in elderly people and people with underlying
health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, are exhibiting a
higher mortality rate in COVID-19.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has 82% similarity with the original SARS-CoV virus attributed to
the outbreak in 2003 (9). A mature SARS-CoV-2 virus generally has a polyprotein (the open
reading frame 1a and 1b, Orf1ab), four structural proteins such as envelope (E) protein;
membrane (M) protein; nucleocapsid (N) protein; spike (S) protein and five accessory proteins
(Orf3a, Orf6, Orf7a, Orf8, Orf10), and particularly, SARS-CoV-2 encodes an additional
glycoprotein having acetyl esterase and hemagglutination (HE) attributes, which identified it
distinct than its two predecessors (10). The functions of accessory proteins may include signal
inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest (11). The S protein on the surface of the viral

particle enables the infection of host cells by binding to the host cell receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), utilizing the S-protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD).
The N protein binds to the RNA genome of the COVID-19 and creates a shell or capsid around
the enclosed nucleic acid. N protein is involved in viral RNA synthesis and folding which
interacts with the viral membrane protein during viral assembly affects host cell responses
including cell cycle and translation . An epitope-based peptide vaccine has been raised in this
aspect. The core mechanism of the peptide vaccine is based on the chemical method to
synthesize the recognized B-cell and T-cell epitopes that can induce specific immune responses
and are immune-dominant. T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments (8-20 amino acids) while
the B-cell epitopes can be proteins (12,13).
Once a mutated virus infects the host cells by escaping the antibodies, it then relies upon the Tcell mediated immunity to fight against the virus. Viral proteins are processed into short peptides
inside the infected cells and then loaded onto major histocompatibility complexes (MHC)
proteins. After that, the MHC-peptide complexes are presented on the infected cell surface for
recognition by specific T cells. Activated CD8+ T cells then recognize the infected cells and clear
them. T-cell immunity also depends strictly on the MHC-peptide complexes which are similar to
the antigen-antibody association. MHC proteins are encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
which is located among the most genetically variable regions on the human genome. Each HLA
allele can only present a certain set of peptides that can be presented on the infected cell surface
and recognized by T cells are called T-cell epitopes. For a vaccine, it is essential to identify Tcell epitopes that originate from conserved regions of the virus T cell responses against the S and
N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (14).

To develop effective diagnostic tests and vaccine, the identification of B-cell and T-cell epitopes
for SARS-CoV-2 proteins are critical especially for structural N and S proteins. Both humoral
immunity and cellular immunity provided by B-cell antibodies and T-cells respectively are
essential for effective vaccines (15,16). Although humans may mount an antibody response
against viruses normally, only neutralizing antibodies can block the entry of viruses into human
cells completely (17). Antibody binding site’s location on a viral protein strongly affects the
body’s ability to produce neutralizing antibodies(18). It is important to understand whether
SARS-CoV-2 has potential antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes) near their interacting surface
with its known human entry receptor, ACE2. Besides neutralizing antibodies, human bodies also
depend on cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells and helper CD4+ T-cells to clear viruses completely from the
body. For anti-viral T-cell responses, presentation of viral peptides by human MHC class I and
class II is essential (19). MHC-I analysis includes common alleles for HLA-A, HLA-B, and
HLA-C. Multiple investigations have indicated that antibodies generated against the N protein of
SARS-CoV are highly immunogenic and abundantly expressed protein during infection (20).
The purpose of our present study is to promote the designing of a vaccine against COVID-19
using in silico methods, considering SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The reason for focusing
particularly on the epitopes in the N structural proteins is due to their dominant and long-lasting
immune response which was reported against SARS-CoV previously. For the identified T-cell
epitopes, we incorporated the information on the associated MHC alleles so that we can provide
a list of epitopes that seek to maximize population coverage globally. Therefore, we designed an
epitope-based peptide vaccine to potentially narrow down the search for potent targets against
SARS-CoV-2 using the computational approach with an expectation that the wet laboratory
research will validate our result.

Materials and Methods

The methodologies used for peptide vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 N protein are shown
in Figure 1.
2.1

Protein sequence retrieval

The SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence was extracted from NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information) protein database (Accession no.: QIC53221.1, GI: 1811294683) in
FASTA format.
2.2

Sequence analysis

The understanding of the features, function, structure, and evaluation is mainly based on the
process of sequence analysis which depicts the process of subjecting DNA, RNA, or peptide
sequences to wide ranges of analytical methods. We implied NCBI BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) (21) that screens homologous sequences from its database and selects
those sequences that are more similar to our SARS-CoV-2 N protein; we also performed multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) using the ClustalW web server with default settings, and a
phylogenetic tree was assembled using MEGA6 software and a web logo was also generated for
the conserved peptide sequences using WebLogo based on this alignment (21–23).
2.3

Protein antigenicity and toxicity prediction

To determine the potent antigenic protein of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein, we used the online
server VaxiJen v2.0, with a default threshold value (24). All the antigenic proteins of SARSCoV-2 N protein with their respective scores were obtained then sorted in Notepad++. A single

antigenic protein with maximum antigenicity scores was selected for further evaluation. The
toxicity of epitopes was analyzed using the Toxinpred web server (25).
2.4

Protein secondary and tertiary structure prediction

The secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was predicted by using CFSSP (Chou &
Fasman Secondary Structure Prediction) because the antigenic part of the protein is more likely
to belong to the β-sheet region (26). Also, we predicted the 3D structure of the protein using
EasyModeller, a graphical user interface (GUI) version of MODELLER, where we designed the
three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein using template proteins from Protein
Data Bank. The model was validated using PROCHECK and PROSA web servers (27–30).
2.5

T-cell epitope prediction

2.5.1 CD8+ T-cell epitope prediction
For the de novo prediction of T-cell epitope, NetCTL 1.2 server was used in this experiment,
using a 0.95 threshold to maintain sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. The
tool expands the prediction for 12 MHC-I supertypes and integrates the prediction of peptide
MHC-I binding, proteasomal C-terminal cleavage with TAP transport efficiency. These
predictions were performed by an artificial neural network, weighted TAP transport efficiency
matrix and a combined algorithm for MHC-I binding and proteasomal cleavage efficiency was
then used to determine the overall scores and translated into sensitivity/specificity. Based on this
overall score, five best peptides (epitopes) were selected for further evaluation.
For the prediction of peptides binding to MHC-I, we used a tool from the Immune Epitope
Database (IEDB) and calculate IC50 values for peptides binding to specific MHC-I molecules

(31). For the binding analysis, all the frequently used alleles were selected with a word length of
nine residues and binding affinity < 200 nm for further analysis. Another tool (named as MHCNP) provided by the IEDB server was used to assess the probability that a given peptide was
naturally processed and bound to a given MHC molecule (32).
2.6

Epitope conservancy and immunogenicity prediction

The degree of similarity between the epitope and the target (i.e. given) sequence is elucidated by
epitope conservancy. This property of epitope gives us the promise of its availability in a range
of different strains. Hence for the analysis of the epitope conservancy, the web-based tool from
IEDB analysis resources was used (33). Immunogenicity prediction can uncover the degree of
influence (or efficiency) of the respective epitope to produce an immunogenic response. The Tcell class I pMHC immunogenicity predictor at IEDB, which uses amino acid properties as well
as their position within the peptide to predict the immunogenicity of a class I peptide MHC
(pMHC) complex (34).
2.7

Prediction of population coverage and allergenicity assessment

The population coverage tool from IEDB was applied to determine the population coverage for
every single epitope by selecting HLA alleles of the corresponding epitope.
Allergenicity of the predicted epitope was calculated using AllerTop v2.0(35), which is an
alignment-free server, used for in silico based allergenicity prediction of a protein-based on its
physiochemical properties.

2.8.1 Epitope model generation
The 3D structures of the selected epitopes were predicted by PEP-FOLD, a web-based server
(36). For each sequence, the server predicted five probable structures. The energy of each
structure was determined by SWISS-PDB VIEWER and the structure with the lowest energy was
chosen for further analysis.
2.8.2 Retrieval of HLA allele molecule
The three-dimensional structure of the HLA-A*68:02 (PDB ID: 4I48) was retrieved from Protein
Data Bank (RCSB-PDB).
2.8.3 Molecular docking analysis
Molecular docking analysis was performed using Autodock vina in PyRx 0.8, by considering the
HLA-A*68:02 molecule as receptor protein and identified epitopes as ligand molecule (37).
Firstly, we used the protein preparation wizard of UCSF Chimera (Version 1.11.2) to prepare the
protein for docking analysis by deleting the attached ligand, adding hydrogens and Gasteiger–
Marsili charges (38,39). The prepared file was then added to the Autodock wizard of PyRx 0.8
and converted into pdbqt format. The energy form of the ligand was minimized and converted to
pdbqt format by OpenBabel (40). The parameters used for the docking simulation were set to
default. The size of the grid box in AutoDock Vina was kept at 50.183 × 50.183 × 50.183 Å
respectively, for X, Y, and Z-axis. AutoDock Vina was implemented via the shell script offered
by AutoDock Vina developers. Docking results were observed by the negative score in kcal/mol,
as the binding affinity of ligands (41).

The prediction of B-cell epitopes was performed to find the potential antigen that assures
humoral immunity. To detect B-cell epitope, various tools from IEDB were used to identify the
B-cell antigenicity, together with the Emini surface accessibility prediction, Kolaskar and
Tongaonkar antigenicity scale, Karplus and Schulz flexibility prediction, Bepipred linear epitope
prediction analysis and since antigenic parts of a protein belonging to the beta-turn regions, the
Chou and Fasman beta-turn prediction tool was also used (42–47).

Results

3.1

Sequence retrieval and analysis

We retrieved the SARS-CoV-2 N protein sequence from the NCBI database (Accession No.:
QIC53221.1). Then we performed BLASTp using NCBI-BLAST for the nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV-2. We searched for a total of 100 homologs with > 60% identical sequences.
Multiple sequence alignment was then performed (Supplementary data 1), and a phylogenetic
tree was constructed (Supplementary Figure S1). From multiple sequence alignment, it has
been confirmed that the protein sequences have a close relationship. A web logo was designed
using the WebLogo server to demonstrate the conserved region (Figure 2).
3.2

Antigenic protein prediction

The most potent antigenic protein of SARS-CoV-2 N protein was predicted by VaxiJen v2.0,
which is based on the auto-cross covariance transformation of protein sequences into uniform
vectors of principal amino acid properties (Table 1). The overall antigen prediction score was
0.5002 (probable antigen) at 0.4 threshold value.
3.3

Toxicity prediction

The toxicity of the selected peptide sequences was assessed using the ToxinPred web server. The
results from the ToxinPred server represented that all of our probable epitopes were found nontoxic (Table 1).
3.4

Protein structure prediction and validation

The secondary of a protein describes the α-helix, β-sheets, and random coil. Our SARS-CoV-2 N
protein has 419 residues, of which 213 residues (50.8%) from the helix, 187 residues from sheets
(44.6%) and 66 (15.8%) residues from the coil (Figure 3). For 3D structure, we built a model
using EasyModeller, which was validated using PROCHECK and PROSA web server. The
discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score was calculated -19585.62653. PROSA predicts
the z-score of the model which was depicted 0.56 and the PROCHECK server was used for
Ramachandran plot calculations. Ramachandran plot of the model protein indicated that 76% of
residues in the most favorable region, 22% in the allowed region and 0.4% in the disallowed
region (Figure 4).
3.5

CD8+ T-cell epitope identification

Based on high combinatorial and MHC binding, the top eight epitopes were predicted by the
NetCTL server from the selected protein sequence were selected for further analysis. Using the
MHC-I binding prediction tool, which is based on SMM, we selected those MHC-I alleles for
which the epitopes showed the highest affinity (IC50 < 200 nm). Proteasomes play an important
role in cleaving the peptide bond, resulting in the conversion of protein into the peptide. The
peptide molecules that are homogeneous to class I MHC molecules and the peptide-MHC
molecule after the proteasomal cleavage were presented as T-helper cells after the transportation
into the cell membrane. The total score of each epitope-HLA interaction was taken into
consideration and higher processing efficiency was meant by obtaining a higher score. The
epitope NTASWFTAL interacted with most of the MHC-I alleles including, HLA-A*68:02,
HLA-C*16:01, HLA-C*03:03, HLA-C*03:04, HLA-C*12:03, HLA-A*02:06, HLA-C*03:02,
HLA-A*26:01 and HLA-C*14:02 (Table 2). Moreover, the MHC-NP prediction tool was used
to find the highest probable score of our predicted epitope NTASWFTAL, with a score of 1.11,

for HLA-A*68:02. Furthermore, all the predicted epitopes had a maximum identity for
conservancy hit and 100% maximum identity was found (Table 2). Also, the I-pMHC
immunogenicity prediction analysis of the epitope NTASWFTAL was found 0.22775 (Table 2).
3.6

Population coverage

The cumulative amount of the population coverage was obtained for the predicted epitope
NTASWFTAL Results from the population coverage demonstrated that with 57.16% coverage,
East Asia found the highest coverage region. The results of the population coverage were shown
in Table 3 and Supplementary Figures S2-S5.
3.7

Allergenicity assessment

The AllerTop server was used for the identification of the allergic reaction caused by a vaccine
in an individual which might be harmful or life-threatening. The allergenicity of the selected
epitope was calculated using the AllerTop tool and predicted as probable non-allergen.
3.8

Molecular docking analysis for HLA and epitope interaction

In this study, the verification of the interaction between the HLA molecules and our predicted
potential epitope was done by molecular docking simulation using Autodock Vina in PyRx 0.8
software. Among all the MHC class I alleles, only HLA-A*68:02 had a maximum probable score
for our most potent epitope NTASWFTAL (Figure 5). Therefore, we carried out the molecular
docking study using HLA-A*68:02 (PDB ID: 4I48). We found that our predicted epitope
NTASWFTAL interacted with HLA-A*68:02 with strong binding affinities of -9.4 kcal/mol
(Figure 6). The selected epitope interacted with Arg6, Ser4, Ser2, Asp30 residues of chain-A
and Lys59, Asp60, Ser58, Gly30 of chain-B through hydrogen bonding (H-bond), whereas Lys7

residue of chain-B form bonds as a result of sharing electrons (which may happen as a result of
charge distribution) (Figure 6).
3.9

B-cell epitope prediction

In this study, using the amino acid scale-based method, we predicted the B-cell epitope
identification. Different analysis methods were used for the prediction of continuous B-cell
epitope. The results of the B-cell predictions were shown in Table 4 and Figures 7-9.
Firstly, Bepipred linear epitope prediction was used, which is regarded as the best single method
for predicting linear B-cell epitopes using a Hidden Markov model. Our analysis revealed that
the peptide sequences from 232 to 269 amino acid residues were able to induce the desired
immune response as B-cell epitopes.
The β-turns were predicted by Chaus and Fasman β-turn prediction method. The region 233-239
residues were predicted as a β-turn region with a score of 1.164, which was higher than the
average score.
For antigenicity prediction, the Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenicity prediction methods were
implied. The method evaluates the antigenicity based on the physicochemical properties of
amino acids and their abundances in experimentally known epitopes. The average antigenic
propensity of our SARS-CoV-2 N protein was 0.988 with a maximum of 1.197 and a minimum
of 0.874. Region 243-249 residues were found prone to antigenicity. Also, the average flexibility
of 1.035 and a minimum of 0.874 was predicted by the Karplus and Schulz flexibility prediction
method. The residues from 238 to 244 were found to be most flexible with the highest score of
1.161. The Parker Hydrophilicity Prediction tool predicts the hydrophilicity of SARS-CoV-2 N

protein with an average score of 2.80, a minimum of 0.874 and the region 235-241 possessed a
score of 5.943, which found moderately similar with the maximum value.
For predicting the surface ability, this study includes the Emini surface accessibility prediction
method. The average surface accessibility was 1.0 and a minimum 0.050. In alignment with the
previous B-cell epitope results, we predicted the peptide sequence from 237 to 242 had the
better surface ability.

Discussion

As yet, it has been reported that the reproduction rate of SARS-CoV-2 is greater than SARS and
MERS and the symptoms of the COVID-19 infection include fever with more than 38 °C body
temperature along with alveolar edema, leading to difficulty in breathing, whereas mild
symptoms perhaps not engender high fever (48). Surprisingly, with a high fatality rate, the
severity of the infection was found more than the infection caused by both SARS and MERS,
with multiple organ damage, which was reported not long ago (49).
At present, researchers are examining repurposed compounds from other viral infections to treat
SARS-CoV-2. For example, both lopinavir and ritonavir are HIV protease inhibitors but in a
lopinavir-ritonavir clinical trial report, the treatment benefit derived was dubious (50). From
recovering patients, several convalescent immunoglobulins are derived which is currently
investigated as a potential treatment for the disease (51). As there have been no approved
treatments for COVID-19 that exists until now, these treatments are the best hope for striving to
keep the mortality rate low before vaccines become widely available.
Despite many potential challenges, vaccine development is a crucial factor in modern
biotechnology as vaccines are the most important prerequisites for defending the burden of
diseases over the world (52). With the divulgement of sequence-based technology in genomics
and proteomics, enough pieces of information are available regarding different eukaryotic and
prokaryotic organisms including viruses. Therefore, utilizing various bioinformatics tools, it is
possible to design peptide-based vaccines through comprehensibly studying the epitopes and
several studies suggested epitope-based vaccines against different diseases including dengue,
chikungunya, Saint Louis encephalitis virus (53–55). Although epitope-dependent vaccine

design is quite familiar, a little research works are done in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Being an
RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is different from the DNA virus as well as the rate of mutation is
higher than the DNA viruses and according to various research, it can be assumed that the
mutations might occur in the N protein (56). Recently, N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are regarded
as a primary target for vaccine development as its function includes viral replication and directly
associated with the infection process (57), as a consequence related to the pathogenesis of
COVID-19. Previous research works have already established that N proteins of several viruses
as well as SARS are considered as a potential target for the development of vaccines (58–61).
Moreover, we have already mentioned the detrimental role of SARS-CoV-2 in host-cell
responses. This aspect leads us to conduct in silico experiments for designing a peptide-based
vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2.
Earlier, it has been thought that vaccine development primarily relies on B-cell immunity, but
recent discovery unveiled that T-cell epitopes are more propitious as a result of more long-lasting
immune response mediated by CD8+ T-cells and due to the antigenic drift, by which an antibody
is not able to respond against an antibody (62). In this study, focusing on MHC class I potential
peptide epitopes, we predicted T-cell as well as B-cell epitopes which were able to show immune
responses in various ways. Many characteristics including antigenicity, toxicity need to take into
consideration for identifying a protein sequence-based epitope into a vaccine candidate and the
predicted eight epitopes were fulfilled the entire criterion. However, only five potent epitopes
have been predicted from the NetCTL 1.2 server and the epitopes were further taken for the
progressive analysis. Besides, all peptides except SSPDDQIGY were able to interact with the
MHC class I alleles, and NTASWFTAL interacted with the most MHC class I alleles. Amongst
them, HLA-A*68:02 possessed the highest probable score. Further, the conservancy of the

epitopes which was predicted by the IEDB conservancy analysis tool delineated that all of our
predicted epitopes had the maximum identity of 100%. Therefore, we have taken the epitope
NTASWFTAL for further analysis due to its maximum interaction with MHC class I alleles and
the highest conservancy.
Allergenicity is regarded as one of the most noteworthy obstacles in vaccine development.
Importantly, T-cells not CD4+ T-cells are involved in an allergic reaction and an allergic reaction
is stimulated by type 2 T helper cell along with immunoglobulin E (63). In this experiment, we
assessed the allergenicity using AllerTop 2.0, which is well recognized for its high sensitivity,
and able to identify structurally diverse allergens in comparison with the known allergens.
AllerTop predicted our selected epitope as non-allergen.
It has been proposed that the T-cell epitopes bind with the MHC molecules and MHC class I
molecules generally presented short peptides that are 8-11 amino acid long, whereas MHC class
II molecules present longer peptides with 13-17 amino acid residues (64). In this experiment, we
determined the binding (presence of the antigen on the surface) affinity of the predicted epitope
using molecular docking analysis and demonstrated that NTASWFTAL interacted with HLAA*68:02 and found a binding affinity of -9.4 kcal/mol, which depicted a greater interaction with
the epitope and the HLA molecule as the more negative energy implied to more binding affinity
(65). The results from the molecular docking studies also revealed that epitope NTASWFTAL
formed H-bond with both chain-A and chain-B of the HLA molecule and attractive charges were
also responsible for the binding.
Another factor that is considered as the most prominent one during the process of vaccine
development is population coverage, as the distribution of HLA varies according to ethnicity and

geographical region. Our experiment showed that the epitope NTASWFTAL covered almost all
regions of the world, where the highest coverage was observed in East Asia, where COVID-19
first reported. Interestingly, our findings indicated that our predicted epitope specifically binds
with the widespread HLA molecules and the vaccine will be easily employed.
In addition, the B-cell epitope provides a strong immune response without causing any adverse
effects. As a result, we also calculated the B-cell epitope prediction and found that the protein
sequences from 232 to 249 amino acid residues as B-cell epitope. The identified region might be
able to stimulate the desired immune response and also important for developing a vaccine.

Conclusions

The advancement in immunoinformatic has now emerged as a potential field for the prediction of
epitope-based vaccines. As viruses can delineate both T-cell and humoral immunity, our
predicted epitope might suggest enhancing the immunity against SARS-CoV-2. The assumption
is based on the basic principles of immunity, which confers the attachment of virus with the host
cell, evoking immune responses and transfers the information to a broad spectrum of T cells and
B cells. Our investigated epitopes mimic the interaction to CD8 cells antigen presentation using
computational approaches. However, our study is an introductory design to predict epitope-based
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and we hope that this predicted epitope will assist the further
laboratory analysis for designing and predicting novel candidates against COVID-19.
