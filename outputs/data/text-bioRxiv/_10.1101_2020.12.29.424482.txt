Three highly pathogenic β-coronaviruses crossed the animal-to-human species
barrier in the past two decades: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARSCoV-2 has infected more than 64 million people worldwide, claimed over 1.4 million
lives and is responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We isolated a
monoclonal antibody, termed B6, cross-reacting with eight β-coronavirus spike
glycoproteins, including all five human-infecting β-coronaviruses, and broadly
inhibiting entry of pseudotyped viruses from two coronavirus lineages. Cryoelectron microscopy and X-ray crystallography characterization reveal that B6
binds to a conserved cryptic epitope located in the fusion machinery and indicate
that antibody binding sterically interferes with spike conformational changes
leading to membrane fusion. Our data provide a structural framework explaining
B6 cross-reactivity with β-coronaviruses from three lineages along with proof-ofconcept for antibody-mediated broad coronavirus neutralization elicited through
vaccination. This study unveils an unexpected target for next-generation structureguided design of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.

Introduction
Four coronaviruses mainly associated with common cold-like symptoms are
endemic in humans, namely OC43, HKU1, NL63 and 229E, whereas three highly
pathogenic zoonotic coronaviruses emerged in the past two decades leading to
epidemics and a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)
was discovered in the Guangdong province of China in 2002 and spread to five continents
through air travel routes, infecting 8,098 people and causing 774 deaths, with no cases
reported after 2004(Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003). In 2012, Middle-East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Arabian Peninsula, where
it still circulates, and was exported to 27 countries, infecting a total of ~2,494 individuals
and claiming 858 lives as of January 2020 according to the World Health

Organization(Zaki et al., 2012). A recent study further suggested that undetected zoonotic
MERS-CoV transmissions are currently occurring in Africa(Mok et al., 2020). A novel
coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, was associated with an outbreak of severe pneumonia
in the Hubei Province of China at the end of 2019 and has since infected over 64 million
people and claimed more than 1.4 million lives worldwide during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic(Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b).
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats(Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al.,
2017; Li et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020) with masked palm civets and
racoon dogs acting as intermediate amplifying and transmitting hosts for SARSCoV(Guan et al., 2003; Kan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005). Although MERS-CoV was
also suggested to have originated in bats, repeated zoonotic transmissions occurred from
dromedary camels(Haagmans et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013). The identification of
numerous coronaviruses in bats, including viruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV, along with evidence of spillovers of SARS-CoV-like viruses to humans
strongly indicate that future coronavirus emergence events will continue to occur(Anthony
et al., 2017; Ge et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019; Li et al., 2005; Menachery et
al., 2015; Menachery et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020).
The coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein mediates entry into host cells and
comprises two functional subunits mediating attachment to host receptors (S1 subunit)
and membrane fusion (S2 subunit)(Ke et al., 2020; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Turoňová et
al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2016a; Walls et al., 2017; Wrapp et al., 2020).
As the S homotrimer is prominently exposed at the viral surface and is the main target of
neutralizing antibodies (Abs), it is a focus of therapeutic and vaccine design
efforts(Tortorici and Veesler, 2019).

We previously showed that the SARS-CoV-2

receptor-binding domain (RBD, part of the S1 subunit) is immunodominant, comprises
multiple distinct antigenic sites, and is the target of 90% of the neutralizing activity present
in COVID-19 convalescent plasma(Piccoli et al., 2020). Accordingly, monoclonal Abs
(mAbs) with potent neutralizing activity were identified against the SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV and MERS-CoV RBDs and shown to protect against viral challenge in vivo (Alsoussi

et al., 2020; Rockx et al., 2008; Rockx et al., 2010; Rogers et al., 2020; Seydoux et al.,
2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a; Zost et al., 2020). The
isolation of S309 from a recovered SARS-CoV individual which neutralizes SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV through recognition of a conserved RBD epitope demonstrated that
potent neutralizing mAbs could inhibit β-coronaviruses belonging to different lineage B
(sarbecovirus) clades (Pinto et al., 2020). An optimized version of S309 is currently under
evaluation in phase 3 clinical trials in the US. Whereas a few other SARS-CoV-2 crossreactive mAbs have been identified from either SARS-CoV convalescent sera (Huo et al.,
2020; ter Meulen et al., 2006; Wec et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) or immunization of
transgenic mice (Wang et al., 2020a), the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 S-specific mAbs
isolated exhibit narrow binding specificity and neutralization breadth.
Although the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the development of SARSCoV-2 vaccines at an unprecedented pace(Case et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2020;
Folegatti et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020b; Jackson et al., 2020; Mulligan et al., 2020;
Sahin et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020a; Yu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a), worldwide
deployment to achieve community protection is expected to take many more months.
Based on available data, it appears unlikely that infection or vaccination will provide
durable pan-coronavirus protection due to the immunodominance of the RBD and waning
of Ab responses, leaving the human population vulnerable to the emergence of
genetically distinct coronaviruses(Edridge et al., 2020; Piccoli et al., 2020). The
availability of mAbs and other reagents cross-reacting with and broadly neutralizing
distantly related coronaviruses is key for pandemic preparedness to enable detection,
prophylaxis and therapy against zoonotic pathogens that might emerge in the future.
We report the isolation of a mAb cross-reacting with the S-glycoprotein of at least
eight β-coronaviruses from lineages A, B and C, including all five human-infecting βcoronaviruses. This mAb, designated B6, broadly inhibits entry of viral particles
pseudotyped with the S glycoprotein of lineage C (MERS-CoV and HKU4) and lineage A

(OC43) coronaviruses, providing proof-of-concept of mAb-mediated broad β-coronavirus
neutralization. A cryoEM structure of MERS-CoV S bound to B6 reveals that the mAb
recognizes a linear epitope in the stem helix within a highly dynamic region of the S2
fusion machinery. Crystal structures of B6 in complex with MERS-CoV S, SARSCoV/SARS-CoV-2 S, OC43 S and HKU4 S stem helix peptides combined with binding
assays reveal an unexpected binding mode to a cryptic epitope, delineate the molecular
basis of cross-reactivity and rationalize observed binding affinities for distinct
coronaviruses. Collectively, our data indicate that B6 sterically interferes with S
conformational changes leading to membrane fusion and identify a key target for nextgeneration structure-guided design of a pan-coronavirus vaccine.
Results
Isolation of a broadly neutralizing coronavirus mAb
To elicit cross-reactive Abs targeting conserved coronavirus S epitopes, we
immunized mice twice with the prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer and
once with the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimer (Figure 1A). We
subsequently generated hybridomas from immunized animals and implemented a
selection strategy to identify those secreting Abs recognizing both MERS-CoV S and
SARS-CoV S but not their respective S1 subunits (which are much less conserved than
the S2 subunit(Walls et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2016a)), the shared foldon trimerization
domain or the his tag. We identified and sequenced a mAb, designated B6, that bound
prefusion MERS-CoV S (lineage C) and SARS-CoV S (lineage B) trimers, the two
immunogens used, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S (lineage B) and OC43 S (lineage A) trimers
with nanomolar to picomolar avidities. Specifically, B6 bound most tightly to MERS-CoV
S (Figure 1B), followed by OC43 S (with one order of magnitude lower apparent affinity,
Figure 1C) and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S (with three orders of magnitude reduced
apparent affinity, Figure 1D-E). These results show that B6 is a broadly reactive mAb
recognizing at least four distinct S glycoproteins distributed across three lineages of the
β-coronavirus genus.

To evaluate the neutralization potency and breadth of B6, we assessed Smediated entry into cells of either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Kaname et al., 2010)
or murine leukemia virus (MLV) (Millet and Whittaker, 2016; Walls et al., 2020b)
pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S, OC43 S, SARS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S and HKU4 S in
the presence of varying concentrations of mAb. We determined half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations of 1.7 ± 0.9 µg/mL, 4.0 ± 0.9 µg/mL and 2.4 ± 0.9 µg/mL for MERS-CoV
S, OC43 S and HKU4 S pseudotyped viruses, respectively (Figure 1F-G) whereas no
neutralization was observed for SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure S1). B6
therefore broadly neutralizes S-mediated entry of pseudotyped viruses harboring βcoronavirus S glycoproteins from lineages A and C, but not from lineage B, putatively due
to lower-affinity binding (Figure 1B-E).

B6 targets a linear epitope in the fusion machinery
To identify the epitope recognized by B6, we determined a cryo-EM structure of
the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein in complex with the B6 Fab fragment at 2.5 Å overall
resolution (Figure 2A-B, Figure S2 and Table 1). 3D classification of the cryoEM data
revealed incomplete Fab saturation, with one to three B6 Fabs bound to the MERS-CoV
S trimer, and a marked conformational dynamic of bound B6 Fabs, yielding a continuum
of conformations. Although these two factors compounded local resolution of the S/B6
interface, we identified that the B6 epitope resides in the stem helix (i.e. downstream from
the connector domain and before the heptad-repeat 2 region) within the S2 subunit (socalled fusion machinery) (Figure 2A-B). Our 3D reconstructions further suggest that B6
binding disrupts the stem helix quaternary structure, which is presumed to form a 3-helix
bundle (observed in the NL63 S(Walls et al., 2016b) and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S
structures(Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2020b; Walls et al.,
2019; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017)) but not maintained in the B6-bound MERSCoV S structure (Figure 2A).
Based on our cryoEM structure, we identified a conserved 15 residue sequence at
the C-terminus of the last residue resolved in previously reported MERS-CoV S

and confirmed by biolayer interferometry that it encompasses the B6 epitope using
synthetic MERS-CoV S biotinylated peptides (Figure 2C-E and Figure S3). We further
found that B6 bound to the corresponding stem helix peptides from all known humaninfecting β-coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the sequence is strictly
conserved among the two viruses, OC43 and HKU1 as well as mouse hepatitis virus and
two MERS-CoV-related bat viruses (HKU4 and HKU5) in mAb and Fab formats (Figure
2D-E). B6 interacted most efficiently with the MERS-CoV S peptide, likely due to its major
role in elicitation of this mAb, followed by all other coronavirus peptides tested, which
bound with comparable affinities, except for HKU1 which interacted more weakly than
other stem helix peptides.

B6 recognizes a conserved epitope in the stem helix
To obtain an atomic-level understanding of the broad B6 cross-reactivity, we
determined five crystal structures of the B6 Fab in complex with peptide epitopes derived
from MERS-CoV S (residues 1230-1240 or 1230-1244), SARS-CoV S (residues 11291143), SARS-CoV-2 S (residues 1147-1161), OC43 S (residues 1232-1246) and HKU4
S (residues 1231-1245), at resolutions ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 Å (Figure 3 A-F, Figure
S4 and Table 2). In all five structures, the stem helix epitope folds as an amphipatic ɑhelix resolved for residues 1230-1240 (MERS-CoV S numbering) irrespective of the
peptide length used for co-crystallization. B6 interacts with the helical epitope through
shape complementarity, hydrogen-bonding and salt bridges using complementarity
determining regions CDRH1-H3, framework region 3, CDRL1 and CDRL3 to bury ~600Å2
at the paratope/epitope interface. The stem helix docks its hydrophobic face, lined by
residues F1231MERS-CoV, L1235MERS-CoV, F1238MERS-CoV and F1239MERS-CoV, into a
hydrophobic groove formed by B6 heavy chain residues Y35, W49, V52 and L61 as well
as light chain Y103 (Figure 2C and 3A, B and D). Moreover, B6 binding leads to the
formation of a salt bridge triad, involving residue D1236MERS-CoV, CDRH3 residue R104
and CDRL1 residue H33.
Comparison of the B6-bound structures of MERS-CoV, HKU4, SARS-CoV/SARSCoV-2 and OC43 S stem helix peptides explains the broad mAb cross-reactivity with βcoronavirus S glycoproteins as shape complementarity is maintained through strict
conservation of 3 out of 4 hydrophobic residues whereas F1238MERS-CoV is conservatively
substituted with Y1137SARS-CoV/Y1155SARS-CoV-2 or W1240 OC43/W1237HKU1 (our structures
demonstrate that all three aromatic side chains are accommodated by B6). Furthermore,
the D1236MERS-CoV-mediated salt bridge triad is preserved, including with a non-optimal
E1237HKU4 side chain, with the exception of S1235HKU1 which abrogates these interactions
and explains the dampened B6 binding to the HKU1 peptide (Figure 2C-E and 3 B-F).

B6 heavy chain residue L61 and CDRL1 residue H33 are mutated from germline and
make major contributions to epitope recognition, highlighting the key contribution of

Mechanism of B6-mediated neutralization
We set out to elucidate the molecular basis of the B6-mediated broad neutralization of
multiple coronaviruses from lineages A and C and lack of inhibition of lineage B
coronaviruses. Our biolayer interferometry data indicate that although the B6 mAb
efficiently interacted with the stem helix peptide of all but one of coronaviruses evaluated
(HKU1, Figure 2D-E), the SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S ectodomain trimers bound
to B6 with three orders of magnitude reduced avidities compared to MERS-CoV S (Figure
1B-E). Whereas the B6 epitope is not resolved in any prefusion coronavirus S structures
determined to date, the stem helix region directly upstream is resolved to a much greater
extent for SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S, indicating a rigid structure(Gui et al., 2017;
Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Walls et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2017)
compared to MERS-CoV S (Pallesen et al., 2017; Park et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2019;
Yuan et al., 2017), OC43 S (Tortorici et al., 2019), HKU1 S (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) or
MHV S (Walls et al., 2016a) (Figure 4A-C). Furthermore, we determined B6 Fab binding
affinities of 0.3 µM and 1.5 µM for MERS-CoV S and OC43 S, respectively, whereas
SARS-CoV S recognition was too weak to accurately quantitate (Figure S5). These
findings along with the largely hydrophobic nature of the B6 epitope, which is expected to
be occluded in the center of a 3-helix bundle (Figure 4 D-E) (as is the case for the region
directly N-terminal to it), suggest that B6 recognizes a cryptic epitope and that binding to
S trimers is modulated (at least in part) by the quaternary structure of the stem. The
reduced conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S stem helix
quaternary structure is expected to limit B6 accessibility to its cryptic epitope relative to
other coronavirus S glycoproteins (Figure 4A-E). This hypothesis is supported by the
correlation between neutralization potency and binding affinity which likely explains the
lack of neutralization of lineage B β-coronaviruses.
Analysis of the postfusion mouse hepatitis S (Walls et al., 2017), SARS-CoV-2 S
(Cai et al., 2020) and SARS-CoV S (Fan et al., 2020) structures show that the B6 epitope
is buried at the interface with the other two protomers of the rod-shaped trimer. As a
result, B6 binding appears to be incompatible with adoption of the postfusion S
conformation (Figure 4F). Collectively, the data presented here suggest that B6 binding

Discussion
The high sequence variability of viral glycoproteins was long considered as an
unsurmountable obstacle to the development of mAb therapies or vaccines conferring
broad protection(Corti and Lanzavecchia, 2013). The identification of broadly neutralizing
mAbs targeting conserved HIV-1 envelope epitopes from infected individuals brought
about a paradigm shift for this virus undergoing extreme antigenic drift(Huang et al., 2012;
Kong et al., 2016; Scheid et al., 2009; Walker et al., 2011; Walker et al., 2009; Wu et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2010). Heterotypic influenza virus neutralization was also described for
human cross-reactive mAbs recognizing the hemagglutinin receptor-binding site or the
fusion machinery(Corti et al., 2011; Dreyfus et al., 2012; Ekiert et al., 2011; Ekiert et al.,
2012; Kallewaard et al., 2016; Whittle et al., 2011). These findings were paralleled by
efforts to identify broadly neutralizing Abs against respiroviruses(Corti et al., 2013),
henipaviruses(Dang et al., 2019; Mire et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2006), Dengue and Zika
viruses(Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Dejnirattisai et al., 2015; Rouvinski et al., 2015) or
ebolaviruses(Bornholdt et al., 2016; Flyak et al., 2018; King et al., 2019; West et al.,
2018).
The genetic diversity of coronaviruses circulating in chiropteran and avian
reservoirs along with the recent emergence of multiple highly pathogenic coronaviruses
showcase the need for vaccines and therapeutics that protect humans against a broad
range of viruses. As the S2 fusion machinery contains several important antigenic sites
and is more conserved than the S1 subunit, it is an attractive target for broad-coronavirus
neutralization(Tortorici and Veesler, 2019; Walls et al., 2016a). Previous studies
described conserved epitopes targeted by neutralizing Abs, such as the fusion peptide or
heptad-repeats, as well as a variable loop in the MERS-CoV S connector domain (Daniel
et al., 1993; Elshabrawy et al., 2012; Pallesen et al., 2017; Poh et al., 2020; Walls et al.,
2016a; Wec et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2004; Zheng et al., 2020). The discovery of the B6
mAb provides proof-of-concept of mAb-mediated broad β-coronavirus neutralization and
uncovers a previously unknown conserved cryptic epitope that is predicted to be located
in the hydrophobic core of the stem helix. B6 cross-reacts with at least eight distinct S
glycoproteins, from β-coronaviruses belonging to lineages A, B and C, and broadly

neutralize two human and one bat pseudotyped viruses from lineages A and C. B6 could
be used for detection or diagnostic of coronavirus infection and humanized versions of
this mAb are promising candidate therapeutics against emerging and re-emerging βcoronaviruses from lineages A and C. Our data further suggest that affinity maturation of
B6 using SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S might enhance recognition of and extend
neutralization breadth towards β-coronaviruses from lineage B. Finally, the identification
of the conserved B6 epitope paves the way for epitope-focused vaccine design(Azoitei et
al., 2011; Correia et al., 2014; Sesterhenn et al., 2020) that could elicit pan-coronavirus
immunity, as supported by the elicitation of the B6 mAb through vaccination and the
recent findings that humans and camels infected with MERS-CoV, humans infected with
SARS-CoV-2 and humanized mice immunized with a cocktail of coronavirus S
glycoproteins produce antibodies targeting an epitope similar to the one targeted by
B6(Song et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b).

Methods
Identification of the B6 broadly neutralizing mAb
Ten-week-old CD-1 mice were injected twice with 50 µg of MERS-CoV S formulated with
Adjuplex at weeks 0 and 2 and once with 50 µg of SARS-CoV S formulated with Adjuplex
at week 8 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Antibody Technology
Resource. 3 days after the final injection splenocytes were isolated from high titer mice
and electrofused with P3x63-Ag8 myeloma cell line (BTX, Harvard Apparatus).
Hybridoma supernatants were tested for binding to prefusion SARS-CoV S, MERS-CoV
S, SARS-CoV S1 subunit, MERS-CoV S1 subunit and respiratory syncytial virus F (which
harbors a foldon motif and a his tag similar to the SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S
ectodomain trimer constructs) using a high throughput bead-based binding array.
Hybridomas from wells containing supernatants that were positive for binding to prefusion
SARS-CoV S and MERS-CoV S but negative for SARS-CoV S1, MERS-CoV S1, and
respiratory syncytial virus F were sub-cloned by limiting dilution and re-screened for
binding as above. The VH and VL sequences of B6 were recovered using the mouse iG
primer set (Millipore) using the protocol outlined in (Siegel, 2009), and Sanger sequenced
(Genewiz). The VH/VL sequences were codon-optimized and cloned into full-length pTT3
derived IgG1 and IgL kappa expression vectors containing human constant regions using
Gibson assembly (Snijder et al., 2018).
Protein expression and purification
MERS-CoV 2P S, OC43 S, SARS-CoV 2P S and SARS-CoV-2 2P S were produced as
previously described (Tortorici et al., 2019; Walls et al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2019). Briefly,
all ectodomains were produced in HEK293F cells grown in suspension using FreeStyle
293 expression medium (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in a humidified 8% (v/v) CO2
incubator rotating at 130 r.p.m. The cultures were transfected using 293fectin
(ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a density of 106 cells/ml and cultivated for
three days. The supernatants were harvested and cells resuspended for another three
days, yielding two harvests. For MERS-CoV 2P S, SARS-CoV 2P S and SARS-CoV-2 2P
S, clarified supernatants were purified using a 5 ml Cobalt affinity column (Takara). HCoVOC43 S was purified using a StrepTrap HP column (GE healthcare). Purified proteins

were concentrated, flash-frozen in Tris-saline (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 (25°C), 150 mM NaCl)
and stored at -80°C. The MERS-CoV S1-Fc and SARS-CoV S1-Fc were previously
described (Raj et al., 2013), produced as aforementioned for the prefusion S trimers and
purified using protein A affinity chromatography.
For mAb B6 production, 250 µg of B6 heavy and 250 µg of B6 light chain encoding
plasmids were co-transfected per liter of suspended HEK293F culture using 293Free
transfection reagent (Millipore Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were transfected at a density of 106 cells/ml. Expression was carried out for 6 days after
which cells and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g followed by
filtration through a 0.22 µm filter. Clarified cell supernatant containing recombinant mAb
was passed over Protein A Agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein A resin was
extensively washed with 25 mM Phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl (PBS) and eluted with
IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific). Purified B6 was extensively dialyzed against PBS,
concentrated, flash-frozen and stored at -80°C.
DS-Cav1-foldon-SpyTag (McLellan et al., 2013) was produced by lentiviral transduction
of HEK293F cells using the Daedalus system (Bandaranayake et al., 2011). Lentivirus
was produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells (ATCC) using linear 25 kDa
polyethyleneimine (PEI; Polysciences). Briefly, 4×10^6 cells were plated onto 10 cm
tissue culture plates. After 24 h, 3 mg of psPAX2, 1.5 mg of pMD2G (Addgene plasmids
#12260 and #12259, respectively), and 6 mg of lentiviral vector plasmid were mixed in
500 mL diluent (5 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and 42 mL of PEI (1 mg/mL) and
incubated for 15 minutes. The DNA/PEI complex was then added to the plate dropwise.
Lentivirus was harvested 48 h post-transfection and concentrated 100× by centrifugation
at 8000×g for 18 h. Transduction of the target cell line was carried out in 125 mL shake
flasks containing 10×10^6 cells in 10 mL of growth media. 100 μL of 100× lentivirus was
added to the flask and the cells were incubated with 225 rpm oscillation at 37°C in 8%
CO2 for 4–6 hours, after which 20 mL of growth media was added to the shake flask.
Transduced cells were expanded every other day to a density of 1×10^6 cells/mL until a
final culture size of 4 L was reached. The media was harvested after 17 days of total
incubation after measuring final cell concentration (~5×10^6 cells/mL) and viability (~90%

viable). Culture supernatant was harvested by low-speed centrifugation to remove cells
from the supernatant. NaCl and NaN3 were added to final concentrations of 250 mM and
0.02%, respectively. The supernatant was loaded over one 5 mL HisTrap FF Crude
column (GE Healthcare) at 5 mL/min by an AKTA Pure (GE Healthcare). The 5 mL
HisTrap column was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer (2× GIBCO 14200075 PBS, 5 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5) followed by 6 column volumes of elution buffer (2×
GIBCO 14200-075 PBS, 150 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5). The nickel elution was applied to a
HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) and run in dPBS (GIBCO
14190-144) with 5% glycerol (Thermo BP229-1) to further purify the target protein by sizeexclusion chromatography. The purified protein was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C.
Kinetics of B6 mAb binding to coronavirus S proteins
The avidities of complex formation between B6 mAb and selected coronavirus S proteins
were determined in PBS supplemented with 0.005 % Tween20 and 0.1% BSA (PBSTB)
at 30 °C and 1,000 RPM shaking on an Octet Red instrument (Fortebio). Curve fitting was
performed using a 1:1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. KD ranges
were determined with a global fit. AHC biosensors (ForteBio) were hydrated in water and
subsequently equilibrated in PBSTB buffer. 10 μg/mL B6 mAb was loaded to the
biosensors to a shift of approximately 1nm. Then, the system was equilibrated in PBSTB
buffer for 300 s prior to immersing the sensors in the respective coronavirus S protein (0
- 218 nM) for up to 600 s prior to dissociation in buffer for additional 600 s.
Binding of B6 to different synthetic coronavirus S stem peptides
B6 binding analysis to selected biotinylated coronavirus S stem helix peptides was
performed in PBS supplemented with 0.005 % Tween20 (PBST) at 30 °C and 1,000 RPM
shaking on an Octet Red instrument (Fortebio).
1 µg/ml biotinylated stem peptide (15- or 16-residue long stem peptide-PEG6-Lys-Biotin
synthesized fom Genscript) was loaded on SA biosensors to a threshold of 0.5 nm. Then,
the system was equilibrated in PBST for 300 s prior to immersing the sensors in 0.1 µM
B6 mAb or 1 µM B6 Fab, respectively, for 300 s prior to dissociation in buffer for 300 s.

Kinetics of B6 Fab binding to different coronavirus S proteins
The rate constants of binding (kon) and dissociation (koff) for the complex between the B6
Fab and selected coronavirus S proteins were performed in PBST at 30 °C and 1,000
RPM shaking on an Octet Red instrument (Fortebio). Global curve fitting was performed
using a 1:1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. For MERS-CoV S and
SARS-CoV S, HIS1K or Ni-NTA biosensors (ForteBio) were hydrated in water and
subsequently equilibrated in PBST buffer. 20 μg/mL SARS-CoV S or 10 μg/mL MERSCoV S, respectively, were loaded to the biosensors for up to 1800 s (1- 4nm shift). The
system was equilibrated in PBST for 300 s prior to immersing the sensors in B6 Fab (0 16 µM) for up to 1800 s prior to dissociation in buffer for 1800 s. For OC43 S, ARG2
biosensors were hydrated in water then activated for 300 s with an NHS-EDC solution
(ForteBio) prior to amine coupling. 20 μg/mL OC43 was amine coupled to AR2G
(ForteBio) sensors in 10 mM acetate pH 6.0 (ForteBio) respectively for 300 s and then
quenched with 1M ethanolamine (ForteBio) for 300 s. The system was equilibrated in
PBST for 300 s prior to immersing the sensors in B6 Fab (0 - 4 µM) for 75 s prior to
dissociation in buffer for 75 s.

Pseudovirus entry assays
Production of OC43 S pseudotyped VSV virus and the neutralization assay was
performed as described previously (Hulswit et al., 2019; Tortorici et al., 2019). Briefly,
HEK-293T cells at 70~80% confluency were transfected with the pCAGGS expression
vectors encoding full-length OC43 S with a truncation of the 17 C-terminal residues (to
increase cell surface expression levels) along with fusion to a flag tag and the Fc-tagged
bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin esterase protein at molar ratios of 8:1. 48 h after
transfection, cells were transduced with VSV∆G/Fluc (bearing the Photinus pyralis firefly
luciferase) (Kaname et al., 2010) at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Twenty-four hours later,
supernatant was harvested and filtered through 0.45 μm membrane. Pseudotyped VSV
virus was titrated on monolayer on HRT-18 cells. In the virus neutralization assay, serially
diluted mAbs were pre-incubated with an equal volume of virus at room temperature for

1 h, and then inoculated on HRT-18 cells, and further incubated at 37˚C. After 20 h, cells
were washed once with PBS, lysed with cell lysis buffer (Promega) and firefly luciferase
expression was measured on a Berthold Centro LB 960 plate luminometer using Dluciferin as a substrate (Promega). Percentage of infectivity was calculated as the ratio of
luciferase readout in the presence of mAbs normalized to luciferase readout in the
absence of mAb, and half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined using
4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism v8.0).
MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped VSV were prepared using
293T cells seeded in 10-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep
and transfected with plasmids encoding for the corresponding S glycoprotein (24 µg/dish)
using lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. One day post-transfection, cells were infected with VSV(G*ΔG-luciferase).
After 2 h, infected cells were washed four times with DMEM before medium supplemented
with anti-VSV-G antibody (I1- mouse hybridoma supernatant diluted 1 to 50, from CRL2700, ATCC). Particles were harvested 18 h post-inoculation, clarified from cellular debris
by centrifugation at 2,000 x g for 5 min and used for neutralization experiments.
MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV S, and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes MLV were prepared as
previously described (Walls et al., 2020b).
For viral neutralization, Huh7 cells (for MERS-CoV S pseudotyped virus) or stable 293T
cells expressing ACE2 (Crawford et al., 2020) (for SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S
pseudotyped viruses) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep were seeded
at 40,000 cells/well into clear bottom white walled 96-well plates and cultured overnight
at 37°C. Twelve-point 3-fold serial dilutions of B6 mAb were prepared in DMEM and
pseudotyped VSV were added 1:1 to each B6 dilution in the presence of anti-VSV-G mAb
from I1- mouse hybridoma supernatant diluted 50 times. After 45 min incubation at 37 ̊C,
40 µl of the mixture was added to the cells and 2 h post-infection, 40 μL DMEM was
added to the cells for 17-20 h. Following infection, medium was removed and 80 μL OneGlo-EX substrate (Promega) was added to the cells and incubated in the dark for 10 min
prior reading on a Varioskan LUX plate reader (ThermoFisher).

SDS–PAGE (4x) loading buffer was added to all concentrated pseudovirus samples. The
samples were run on a 4–20% (wt/vol) gradient Tris-glycine gel (BioRad) and transferred
to PVDF membranes. B6 was used as primary Ab (1:500 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor
680-conjugated goat anti-human secondary Ab (1:50,000 dilution, Jackson Laboratory)
were used for western blotting. A LI-COR processor was used to develop images.
CryoEM sample preparation and data collection.
Lacey carbon copper grids (400 mesh) were coated with a thin-layer of continuous carbon
using a carbon evaporator. 1 mg/ml MERS-CoV S was incubated with 100 mM
neuraminic acid (to promote the closed trimer conformation), 150mM Tris pH 8 (25°C)
150 mM NaCl for 16 h at 4°C. Then a 2-fold molar excess of B6 Fab over MERS-CoV S
protomer was added to the solution and incubated for 1h at 37°C. The sample was diluted
to 0.2 mg/ml S protein with 100 mM neuraminic acid-150mM Tris pH 8 (25°C) 150mM
NaCl before 3 µl sample were applied on to a freshly glow discharged grid. Plunge
freezing was performed using a TFS Vitrobot Mark IV (blot force: -1, blot time: 2.5 s,
Humidity: 100 %, temperature: 25 °C). Data were acquired using an FEI Titan Krios
transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2
Summit direct detector and Gatan Quantum GIF energy filter, operated in zero-loss mode
with a slit width of 20 eV. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon
(Suloway et al., 2005) at a nominal magnification of 130,000x with a pixel size of 0.525Å.
The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in superresolution mode fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms. 2,180 micrographs were collected
in a single session with a defocus range comprised between -0.5 and -3.0 μm.
CryoEM data processing
Movie frame alignment, estimation of the microscope contrast-transfer function
parameters, particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp (Tegunov and
Cramer, 2019). Particle images were extracted with a box size of 800 pixels2 binned to
400 pixels2 yielding a pixel size of 1.05 Å. Two rounds of reference-free 2D classification
were performed using Relion3.0 (Zivanov et al., 2018) to select well-defined particle
images. Subsequently, two rounds of 3D classification with 50 iterations each (angular

sampling 7.5° for 25 iterations and 1.8° with local search for 25 iterations), using the
previously reported closed MERS-CoV S structure without the G4 Fab (PDB 5W9J) as
initial model were carried out using Relion without imposing symmetry.
For the high resolution map, particle images were subjected to Bayesian polishing
(Zivanov et al., 2019) before performing non-uniform refinement, defocus refinement and
non-uniform refinement again in cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017). Finally, two rounds of
global CTF refinement of beam-tilt, trefoil and tetrafoil parameters was performed before
a final round of non-uniform refinement to produce the 2.5Å resolution map.
For the lower resolution map, one additional round of focused classification in Relion with
50 iterations using a broad mask covering the region of interest (B6/stem) was carried out
to further separate distinct B6 Fab conformations. 3D refinements of the best subclasses
were carried out using homogenous refinement in cryoSPARC (Punjani et al., 2017).
Reported resolutions are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of
0.143 criterion and Fourier shell correlation curves were corrected for the effects of soft
masking by high-resolution noise substitution (Chen et al., 2013).
CryoEM model building and analysis
UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) were used to fit
atomic models into the cryoEM maps. The MERS-CoV S EM structure in complex with 5N-acetyl neuraminic acid (PDB 6Q04, residue 18-1224) and the B6-MERS-CoV11
(residue 1230-1240) crystal structure were fit into the cryoEM map. Subsequently the
linker connecting the stem helix to the rest of the MERS-CoV S ectodomain (residue
1225-1229) was manually built using Coot. N-linked glycans were hand-built into the
density where visible and the models were refined and relaxed using Rosetta using both
sharpened and unsharpened maps (Frenz et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2016). Models were
analyzed using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010), EMringer (Barad et al., 2015), Phenix
(Liebschner et al., 2019) and privateer (Agirre et al., 2015) to validate the stereochemistry
of both the protein and glycan components. Figures were generated using UCSF
Chimera.

All crystallization experiments were performed at 23 °C in hanging drop vapor diffusion
experiments with initial concentrations of 20 mg/ml and 1.5-fold molar excess of peptide
ligand. Crystal trays were setup with a mosquito using 100 nL mother liquor solution and
100 or 150 nL B6/peptide complex solution, respectively. Crystals of B6/MERS-CoV11
and B6/OC4315 appeared after several weeks in 0.2 M Potassium Thiocyanate and 20%
(w/v) PEG3350, B6/MERS-CoV15 in 0.2 M Magnesium Chloride and 20% (w/v) PEG3350,
B6/HKU415 in 0.6 M Sodium Chloride, 0.1 M MES-NaOH, pH 6.5 and 20% (w/v) PEG
4000, B6-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-216 in 0.2 M Potassium Chloride and 20% (w/v)
PEG3350. Crystals were cryoprotected by addition of glycerol to a final concentration of
25% (v/v) and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the
beamlines 8.2.1 and 5.0.1 (Advanced Light Source, Berkeley, USA). All data were
integrated, indexed and scaled using mosflm (Battye et al., 2011) and Aimless (Evans
and Murshudov, 2013) or XDS (Kabsch, 2010). The structures were solved by molecular
replacement using Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) and the S230 Fab (PDB 6NB8) or B6 Fab
without ligand as a search model. Model building was performed with Coot (Emsley et
al., 2010) and structure refinement with Buster (Blanc et al., 2004) and Phenix
(Liebschner et al., 2019). Validation used Molprobity (Chen et al., 2010) and Phenix
(Liebschner et al., 2019).
