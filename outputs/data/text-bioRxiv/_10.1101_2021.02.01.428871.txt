Highlights:
 Nanotraps block interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and host

ACE2 receptors
 Nanotraps trigger macrophages to engulf and clear virus without becoming infected
 Nanotraps showed excellent biosafety profiles in vitro and in vivo
 Nanotraps blocked infection to living human lungs in ex vivo lung perfusion system

Progress and Potential:
To address the global challenge of creating treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
devised a nanomedicine termed “Nanotraps” that can completely capture and eliminate
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The Nanotraps integrate protein engineering, immunology,
and nanotechnology and are effective, biocompatible, safe, stable, feasible for mass
production. The Nanotraps have the potential to be formulated into a nasal spray or
inhaler for easy administration and direct delivery to the respiratory system, or as an
oral or ocular liquid, or subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection to target
different sites of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, thus offering flexibility in administration and
treatment. More broadly, the highly versatile Nanotrap platform could be further
developed into new vaccines and therapeutics against a broad range of diseases in
infection, autoimmunity and cancer, by incorporating with different small molecule
drugs, RNA, DNA, peptides, recombinant proteins, and antibodies.

Summary
SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through its viral spike protein binding to angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the host cells. Here we show functionalized
nanoparticles, termed “Nanotraps”, completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by
blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of
host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either
recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and
phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARSCoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell
lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis
of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance
of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated
excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the Nanotraps inhibited
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in live human lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion
system. In summary, Nanotraps represent a new nanomedicine for the inhibition of
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the global
pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of January 8, 2021, SARSCoV-2 has spread to over 180 countries and has resulted in more than 88.2 million
infections and over 1.9million deaths globally(Dong et al., 2020). Despite tremendous
efforts devoted to drug development, safe and effective medicines to treat SARS-CoV2 infection are largely lacking. Given that the virus is within nanoscale, nanomaterial
based delivery systems are expected to play a paramount role in the success of
prophylactic or therapeutic approaches(Florindo et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020). To
combat this highly contagious virus, here we set out to devise a nanomedicine termed
“Nanotraps” to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To gain entry to host cells for infection, SARS-CoV-2 surface spike protein
binds to its receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high
affinity(Shang et al., 2020b, 2020a; Vabret et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Blocking
entry of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells is one of the most effective ways to prevent infection.
To achieve this goal, both soluble recombinant ACE2 proteins(Lei et al., 2020; Monteil
et al., 2020) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies(Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al.,
2020b; Chi et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) have been developed to
inhibit the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and cell-surface ACE2,
although they show limited potency(Chen et al., 2020a; Lei et al., 2020; Monteil et al.,
2020). Inspired by tumor cells secreting PD-L1 exosomes to attenuate T-cell effector
functions(Daassi et al., 2020), here we designed a therapeutic nanoparticle termed
“Nanotrap” to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The Nanotrap surfaces were
functionalized with either ACE2 recombinant proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibodies with high surface density. This design endowed the Nanotraps

with high-avidity to outperform its soluble ACE2 or antibody counterparts to capture
and contain SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the high avidity, small size, and high diffusivity of our
newly engineered Nanotraps efficiently blocked the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2expressing host cells including epithelial cells in the respiratory system, resulting in
abrogation of SARS-CoV-2 entry.
Furthermore, we aimed to clear the virus after containment by the Nanotrapmediated macrophage phagocytosis. The role of macrophages in the control of
infections has long been documented(Gordon, 2016), and recent single-cell RNA
sequencing found abundant monocyte-derived macrophages in the bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients(Liao et al., 2020). As professional phagocytes,
macrophages engulf apoptotic cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine on the outer
leaflet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells(Aderem and Underhill, 1999; Fadok
et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2006). Phosphatidylserine coatings have been previously
employed to enhance the uptake of liposomal nanoparticles by macrophages(Johnstone
et al., 2001; Shah et al., 2019). Thus, our Nanotraps were further designed to guide the
phosphatidylserine-specific phagocytosis by macrophages, enabling not only the
containment but also the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 through binding and subsequent
phagocytosis.
Herein, we engineered Nanotraps composed of a Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved polylactic acid (PLA) polymeric core, a liposome shell, surface
ACE2/neutralizing antibodies, and phosphatidylserine ligands. Our Nanotraps
completely blocked pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 entry into susceptible ACE2overexpressing HEK293T cells, lung epithelial A549 cells, and human primary lung
cells, as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells. Subsequently,
macrophages efficiently engulfed and neutralized virus-bound, biodegradable

Nanotraps through phosphatidylserine-guided phagocytosis without causing infection
to macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, in vitro cell culture and in vivo intratracheal
administration of Nanotraps to immunocompetent mice demonstrated an excellent
biosafety profile. Lastly, the Nanotraps completely inhibited infection of SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus in live human lungs maintained under normothermic physiologic
conditions on a clinically applicable ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) system(Cypel et al.,
2008; Divithotawela et al., 2019), confirming the therapeutic efficacy. Our Nanotraps
are safe, effective, biocompatible, ready for mass production, and convenient to use. It
presents a new type of nanomedicine to effectively contain and clear SARS-CoV-2 for
the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
RESULTS
Design, synthesis, and characterization of Nanotraps
SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via surface spike proteins that bind to human
ACE2 receptors on host cells with very high affinity(Hwang et al., 2020; Lan et al.,
2020; Shang et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020a). To inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
set out to engineer a family of nano-enabled virus-trapping particles, termed
“Nanotraps”, to contain and clear SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1A). We used an FDAapproved, biodegradable PLA polymeric core and liposome shell materials to
synthesize the Nanotraps. Nanotraps with different diameters (200, 500, and 1200 nm)
were synthesized by varying polymer concentrations (see Methods for details) (Figure
S1A). The solid PLA core acts as a ‘cytoskeleton’ to provide mechanical stability,
controlled morphology, biodegradability, and large surface area for nanoscale
membrane coating and surface modification. The lipid shell enveloping the PLA core
exhibits behavior similar to that of cell membranes. The lipid shell provides a
nanoscopic platform and can interact with a wide variety of molecules(Allen and Cullis,

2013; Riley et al., 2019; Torchilin, 2005) either within the membrane or on the
surface(Suk et al., 2016; Torchilin, 2014). Thus, we aimed to functionalize the Nanotrap
surface with a molecular bait (a recombinant ACE2 protein or an anti-SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibody) and a phagocytosis-inducing ligand (phosphatidylserine). We
hypothesized that (1) the high-density ACE2 or neutralizing antibodies on the
Nanotraps can outcompete low-expression ACE2 on host cells in capturing SARSCoV-2, thus enabling selective virus containment by the Nanotraps, and that (2) surface
phosphatidylserine ligands on suitably sized Nanotraps can trigger subsequent
phosphatidylserine-mediated phagocytosis by professional phagocytes, such as
macrophages, thus enabling viral clearance (Figure 1A). The resultant structures were
monodispersed and significantly smaller than mammalian cells, yet still large enough
to bind several SARS-CoV-2 virions (Figure 1B-F).
To characterize the Nanotraps, we first used dynamic light scattering to measure
the size dispersity of the constituent nanoparticles. Controlling particle size is important
for tuning the phagocytosis efficacy, reproducible mechanical characteristics, and
material biocompatibility(Champion et al., 2008; He et al., 2010). The hydrolyzed
diameter of the Nanotraps was measured by dynamic light scattering, which increased
with the addition of each molecule (Figure 1B). The zeta potential, which reflects the
surface charges of the Nanotraps(Doane et al., 2012), was found to change slightly with
the addition of each molecule to the Nanotrap surface (Figure 1C). We next used
fluorescent labeling and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to
confirm the presence of the ACE2 moiety on the Nanotraps. The PLA polymeric core
of each Nanotrap was labelled with a lipophilic carbocyanine dye: 1,1'-dioctadecyl3,3,3',3'- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiD, red).
The Nanotrap-ACE2 were further stained with an anti-ACE2 antibody labelled with

Alexa fluor-488 dye (AF488, green). The TIRFM images clearly showed excellent colocalization between the Nanotrap core and surface ACE2 at the single particle level,
confirmed by line scans of the fluorescent channels corresponding to each component
(Figure 1D). These results demonstrated that we have successfully functionalized the
Nanotraps with recombinant ACE2 protein. Finally, we employed scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) to image the Nanotraps at the sub-nanometer level. SEM images
showed that the Nanotraps were spherical and well-dispersed (Figure S1B). The
Nanotraps appeared slightly crenellated in the SEM images, as the lipid layer may have
shrunk due to the drying sample preparation procedure before imaging (Figure 1E). As
expected, after incubation with the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37 ℃, the
Nanotraps effectively captured the virus as evidenced by single virions clearly
visualized on the surface of a Nanotrap; no freestanding virions were observed outside
of the Nanotrap (Figure 1F).
Phagocytosis of Nanotraps by macrophages
Macrophages are a class of phagocytes that engulf and clear cell debris, pathogens,
microbes, cancer cells and other foreign intruders(Gordon, 2016). Macrophages
specialize in the removal of dying or dead cells by recognizing phosphatidylserine on
the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells(Aderem and Underhill, 1999;
Fadok et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2006). Phosphatidylserine coatings have been previously
employed to enhance macrophage uptake of liposomal nanoparticles(Han et al., 2016;
Harel-Adar et al., 2011; Toita et al., 2016). Because phagocytosis by macrophages is
highly dependent on size and surface phosphatidylserine, we determined the optimal
size and surface phosphatidylserine density of Nanotraps. We first synthesized

nm (Figure S2A). After incubating Nanotraps with differentiated THP-1 (dTHP-1)
macrophages(Lund et al., 2016) for varying time durations, we examined the sizedependent phagocytosis by dTHP-1 macrophages using flow cytometry. We found that
the 500-nm Nanotraps outperformed the 200-nm and 1200-nm counterparts after 24and 48-hour incubations, as demonstrated by the percent uptake (Figure 2A) and the
mean fluorescent intensity of DiO dye (Figure 2A and Figure S2) in dTHP-1
macrophages. Accordingly, 500-nm PLA-core Nanotraps were chosen for all further
experiments.
We next functionalized the Nanotraps with varying surface densities of
phosphatidylserine to induce phagocytosis by macrophages. The overall negative
charge of the Nanotraps increases as the percentage of phosphatidylserine ratio
increases, confirming the presence of phosphatidylserine (Figure S2B). We found that
phagocytosis by macrophage was roughly correlated to the percentage of
phosphatidylserine (Figure 2C-D). The phosphatidylserine-dependent phagocytosis of
Nanotraps by dTHP-1 macrophages were further demonstrated by three-dimensional
lattice light-sheet microscopy images (Figure 2E-F and Supplemental Video 1). These
experiments not only confirmed successful functionalization of the Nanotraps, but also
identified the optimal surface density of phosphatidylserine on the Nanotrap surfaces.
Thus, we utilize the 500-nm core size and 15% surface phosphatidylserine Nanotraps
for the following experiments to maximize viral capture and macrophage phagocytosis.

Nanotraps neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro
We next generated multiple types of Nanotraps to test their efficacy. First, avi-tagged
biotinylated ACE2 was conjugated to the Nanotrap surface via biotin-streptavidin
interactions to make Nanotrap-ACE2. In addition, we synthesized Nanotrap-Antibody

by conjugating a SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody to the Nanotrap surface via Nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters (see details in Experimental procedures). Finally, in
order to test the specificity of the Nanotraps, we made Nanotrap-Blank without a virusbinding epitope.
We next examined whether the Nantraps could effectively capture and contain
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. All three Nanotraps were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 spike
pseudotyped lentivirus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for 1 hour before adding to
HEK293T-ACE2 cells for 24 hours and 72 hours, respectively. Both Nanotrap-ACE2
and Nanotrap-Antibody completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, while
the Nanotrap-Blank did not, indicating both the specificity and functionality of our
Nanotraps (Figure 3A-B and Figure S3A-B). In sharp contrast, soluble recombinant
ACE2 protein only partially inhibited infection to HEK293T-ACE2 cells with both
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus (Figure 3C and Figure S3C) and VSV
(Figure 3D and Figure S3D), despite the previous use of soluble ACE2 protein to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection(Lei et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020).
Macrophages play a key role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection(Lund et al.,
2016). We thus further determined whether human macrophages could efficiently
engulf and degrade the virus-bound Nanotraps-ACE2 without becoming infected
(Figure 1E-F). Importantly, after incubating SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped VSV with
dTHP-1 macrophages for 24 hours, no infection was found in the macrophages (Figure
3E-F, comparing “MФ” with “MФ +V”). This experiment demonstrated the feasibility
of utilizing macrophages to clear the viral infection. We then infected a human lung
epithelial cell line A549, which expresses physiological levels of surface ACE2, with
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped VSV in the absence or presence of dTHP-1
macrophages. These data suggest that macrophages significantly reduced the viral

infection but could not completely eradicate it (Figure 3E-F, comparing “E+V” with
“E+ MФ+V”). Finally, we determined whether our engineered Nanotraps triggered
phosphatidylserine-mediated phagocytosis by dTHP-1 macrophages for the clearance
of virus. After adding Nanotrap-ACE2 into the co-culture of epithelial cells,
macrophages, and SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped VSV, the viral infection was
completely inhibited (Figure 3E-F, comparing “E+V+NT” and “E+MФ +V+NT” with
“E+MФ+V”). We further observed incorporation of Nanotrap-ACE2 into the
macrophage cell body, indicating successful phagocytosis (Figure 2E, Figure 3E
“E+MФ+V+NT” inset, Supplemental Video 1).
In brief summary, our in vitro neutralizing experiments demonstrated that our
Nanotraps not only served as a sponge to capture and contain SARS-CoV-2, but also
utilized the phagocytosis and sterilization machinery of macrophages to defend the host
cells from infection, as we depicted in our original experimental design (Figure 1A).

In vivo local delivery to lungs and biosafety profile of Nanotraps in mice
In order to assess the safety of Nanotrap treatment, we first examined in vitro
cytotoxicity on human cell lines. Neither A549 nor HEK293T-ACE2 cells displayed
significant cytotoxicity with the addition of Nanotrap-Blank, Nanotrap-ACE2, or
Nanotrap-Antibody, as evaluated by a CCK8 cytotoxicity assay (Figure S4).
We next examined the delivery of Nanotraps to mouse lungs and evaluated the
biosafety of Nanotraps in vivo. We intratracheally injected immunocompetent mice
with Nanotrap-ACE2 (labelled with DiD) at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Mice were sacrificed
3 days post-injection. Delivery of Nanotraps to mouse lungs was confirmed with
cryosectioned mouse lung tissues: significant Nanotrap accumulation and distribution
were found in the lung tissues, particularly in regions around bronchioles in the
11

respiratory tracts. As expected, no Nanotraps were found in the lungs of PBS-treated
mice (Figure 4A-B).
In vivo safety was next analyzed. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of
major organs including lung, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney showed no histological
differences in the Nanotrap-treated mice when compared to the PBS-treated control
group (Figure 4C). Furthermore, complete blood counts were performed to evaluate
white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs). The cell counts
were similar between Nanotrap- and PBS-treated groups (Figure 4D). Next,
comprehensive metabolic panels of mouse blood sera were examined to provide an
overall picture of the chemical balance and metabolism. No statistical differences were
found between Nanotrap- and PBS-treated mice for glucose levels, electrolyte and fluid
balance, kidney function, or liver function (Figure 4E). These results demonstrated the
safety of Nanotraps when delivered in vivo.
The therapeutic efficacy of Nanotraps in ex vivo human lungs
We next examined their therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2
infection in healthy, non-transplantable human donor lungs using an ex vivo lung
perfusion (EVLP) system (Figure 5A and Supplemental Video 2). EVLP allows a lung
to be perfused and ventilated ex vivo after organ retrieval by maintaining lungs at
normothermic physiologic conditions and is thus an excellent platform to model lung
diseases(Doane et al., 2012).
The infection potential of the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus at
different doses over time in primary human lung cells was first tested in vitro, and
infection was observed within 8 hours (Figure S5A-B). After confirming infection
potential, we tested our Nanotraps on an EVLP system with a pair of healthy lungs.

Static lung compliance and oxygenation capacity was measured over time (Figure S5C).
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus carrying a luciferase reporter gene was injected into the
lingula of left upper lung lobe, and pseudovirus plus Nanotrap-Antibody was injected
into the right middle lobe; the right upper lung lobe was used as an untreated control
(Figure 5C, arrows). Human lung tissue samples were collected after perfusing for 8
hours. Single-cell suspensions were generated, and luciferase expression was
determined (Figure 5B). The results showed that (1) the pseudovirus infected the lung
tissues and (2) the Nanotraps completely inhibited the viral infection. Furthermore,
H&E staining showed significant RBC infiltration in the virus-treated sample, which
was not present in the virus plus Nanotrap-treated region (Figure 5C).
As our EVLP system maintains lung viability for less than 12 hours, we treated
single-cell suspensions of healthy, untreated lung from the right upper lobe in vitro for
48 hours to confirm the Nanotraps can function for longer term incubations in human
tissue. Again, Nanotrap-Antibody was able to fully inhibit the virus (Figure 5D). Finally,
since the EVLP could not be conducted under BSL-3 conditions in order to use
authentic SARS-CoV-2, we tested the ability of the Nanotraps to prevent authentic
SARS-CoV-2 from infecting Vero E6 cells, which are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection(Matsuyama et al., 2020). Indeed, Nanotrap-Antibody was able to
completely inhibit infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2, as expected (Figure 5E).
Taken together, our EVLP experiments demonstrated that (1) SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus can infect human lung, and (2) our newly engineered Nanotraps can
completely block the viral infection, thus paving the way for future clinical trials using
Nanotraps for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Discussion
The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic, so
effective and safe treatments are urgently needed. Remdesivir has been approved by the
FDA to treat severe COVID-19(Beigel et al., 2020), despite its inconsistent clinical
benefits and various reported adverse effects(Grein et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020b).
Transfusion of convalescent plasma from recovered patients has shown clinical benefits
in some COVID-19 patients(Shen et al., 2020), however, this approach is challenged
by the limited availability of donor plasma and appropriate medical facilities(PérezCameo and Marín-Lahoz, 2020). Simultaneously, tremendous efforts have been
devoted to the development of vaccines, neutralizing antibodies, and other drugs for the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19. While recently developed vaccines are being
dispersed to the population, safe and effective medicines to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection
are largely lacking. For example, Nanosponges have been developed (Zhang et al.,
2020), but they cannot completely inhibit infection. They are also not a viable treatment
option: as each patient’s human leukocyte antigen is different, Nanosponges would
have to be personalized for each patient. Large amounts of uninfected primary cells
would have to be collected from each patient to make personalized Nanosponges,
similar to CAR-T therapy, which has resulted in exorbitant costs and is thus unattainable
by many patients(Fiorenza et al., 2020). In addition, recombinant soluble ACE2 or
ACE2-IgG proteins have been proposed for use as treatments (Chen et al., 2020b; Lei
et al., 2020), but soluble proteins are known to be much more liable to degradation than
nanoparticles (Yu et al., 2016). Here we aimed to develop Nanotraps to effectively
inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. The design of our Nanotraps was inspired by the ability
of tumor cells to secrete PD-L1 exosomes, which bind to and suppress T-cell immune
functions and thus prevent the killing and clearance of the tumor cells(Chen et al., 2018;

Daassi et al., 2020). In a similar fashion, the synthetic Nanotraps can mimic the target
cells to ensnare the virus. Meanwhile, the synthetic polymer-lipid complexes takes
advantage of both the stability from polymers and surface flexibility of
lipids(Mukherjee et al., 2019), thereby providing a well-controlled nanomaterial with a
high capacity to trap the virus by mimicking target cells. We thus created Nanotraps to
bind and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells.
To block the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host
ACE2 receptors, we coated the Nanotrap surfaces with a high molecular density of
either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (Figure
1A). In principle, the high binding avidity, high diffusivity, and small size of Nanotraps
should enable them to easily outcompete low ACE2-expressing host cells in capturing
the SARS-CoV-2, thus effectively containing the viruses on their surfaces. Indeed, our
experiments demonstrated that viral infection of both pseudotyped and authentic
SARS-CoV-2 across human cell lines, lung primary cells and lung organs can be
completely inhibited by Nanotrap-ACE2 or Nanotrap-Antibody (Figure 3 and Figure
5). Notably, Nanotrap-ACE2 was superior to the soluble recombinant ACE2 proteins in
containing SARS-CoV-2(Lei et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020), attributing to their high
binding avidity (Figure 3C-D).
Furthermore, our Nanotraps harness the immune system to clear the SARSCoV-2 (Figure 2 and Figure 3). By incorporating the phagocyte-specific
phosphatidylserine ligands onto the Nanotrap surfaces, macrophages readily engulfed
the virus-bound Nanotraps without becoming infected themselves (Figure 3E-F). While
macrophages were used as a proof-of-principle in this study, other professional
phagocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells should be able to
similarly clear the virus-bound Nanotraps. In particular, macrophages and dendritic

cells are professional antigen presenting cells, which present engulfed antigens to the
adaptive immune system(Janeway, 2008). Since the Nanotraps are able to engage
antigen presenting cells, it is possible that they may also elicit virus-specific adaptive
immune responses. Future studies will evaluate whether Nanotraps can prime adaptive
immune responses, thereby promoting vaccine-like protection(Klichinsky et al., 2020).
In addition, we purposely designed Nanotraps to be biocompatible,
biodegradable and safe. The Nanotraps were composed of FDA-approved polymers and
lipids, which provides the possibility for safe administration in a clinical setting. Indeed,
our biosafety experiments have demonstrated excellent safety profile in vitro and in
vivo (Figure 4).
Lastly, we tested the efficacy of the Nanotraps in a human EVLP system.
Superior to lung organoids which cannot reproduce whole-organ response to viral
infection(Han et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020; Suzuki et al., 2020), and non-human
primate models which are extremely costly(Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Rockx et al.,
2020; Yu et al., 2020), the EVLP system is a clinically relevant model. We showed that
our Nanotraps can completely inhibit viral infection in living human lungs (Figure 5).
As current biosafety regulations preclude the testing of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the
EVLP, we further confirmed our Nanotraps can inhibit authentic virus in vitro (Figure
5E). These experiments together suggest our Nanotraps could potentially be used to
treat SARS-CoV-2 infection in the clinic.
In summary, we developed a new type of potent, effective nanomedicine
“Nanotraps” to contain and clear SARS-CoV-2 by harnessing and integrating the power
of nanotechnology and immunology. The Nanotraps completely inhibited the SARSCoV-2 infection to human cells and lung organs. The Nanotraps are effective,

biocompatible, safe, stable, feasible for mass production. It is reasonable to hypothesize
that the Nanotraps could be easily formulated into a nasal spray or inhaler for easy
administration and direct delivery to the respiratory system, or as an oral or ocular liquid,
or subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous injection to target different sites of
SARS-CoV-2 exposure, thus offering flexibility in administration. Furthermore, the
design of our Nanotrap is highly versatile: they can be modified to incorporate small
molecule drugs or protein/mRNA vaccines to their core, and different human ACE2
recombinant proteins(Lei et al., 2020; Monteil et al., 2020), human anti-SARS-CoV-2
neutralizing antibodies(Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Chi et al., 2020; Rogers et
al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020), or any newly-developed therapeutic proteins or peptides can
be conjugated to the surface, thus easily extending their applications beyond our current
study. Overall, we thus expect continuous development of this nanomedicine for
clinical use of preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Synthesis of Nanotraps
To synthesize the Nanotraps, we employed a two-step method developed for polymerlipid hybrid nanoparticles, in which the polymer and lipid components were prepared
separately and combined at the end of the process. The PLA nanoparticles were
prepared in accordance with existing methods(Li et al., 2020) through an oil-in-water
emulsion solvent evaporation process. 100 mg of PLA and 100 µL of PFOB were
dissolved in 3.5 mL of dichloromethane. The organic phase was mixed with 20 mL of
2.0% PVA solution. The mixture was emulsified by sonication (Fisher Sonics) on ice
for 2 minutes. The dichloromethane in the emulsified mixture was evaporated under
magnetic stirring at 300 rpm for 3-4 hours at room temperature. The resulting solution
was centrifuged and the pellets were washed with PBS 3 times (5,000×g for 10 minutes),
and then the pellets were lyophilized and stored at 4 °C before use. For any fluorescence
labeling, 0.05 mg DiD or DiO was added into the 100 mg PLA organic phase when

preparing the Nanotraps. For PLA nanoparticles with size 200 nm, 100 mg of PLA was
emulsified with 2.0% PVA and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. For
PLA nanoparticles with size 500 nm, 100 mg of PLA and 100 µL PFOB were mixed,
then emulsified with 2.0% PVA and the pellets were collected after centrifugation. For
PLA nanoparticles with size 1200 nm, 100 mg of PLA and 100 µL PFOB were mixed
and emulsified with 1.0% PVA and the pellets were collected after centrifugation.

Functionalized PLA-nanoparticles composed of 15% phosphatidylserine and 0.5%
DSPE-PEG2000-biotin were prepared by dissolving DOPS (0.388 μmol), DSPC (1.292
μmol), cholesterol (0.775 μmol), DSPE-mPEG2000 (0.166 μmol) and DSPE-PEG2000biotin (0.013 μmol) at a molar ratio of 10:120:60:9:1 in dichloromethane. The
dichloromethane solvent was slowly evaporated by heating the lipid solution at 55 C
to remove the solvent and further dried in a vacuum drying oven to produce a dried
lipid film. The lipid film was reconstituted in 2 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 mg
PLA nanoparticles and the contents were hydrated at 60 C under ultrasonication
(Branson CPX5800H). Then the mixture was sonicated with a sonicator probe (Fisher
Sonics) for 2 minutes (100 W, 22.5 kHz, 30% amplitude). Formulations for Nanotraps
with different phosphatidylserine surface densities were listed in Table S1.
To synthesize Nanotrap-ACE2, 1 mg of the biotin functionalized PLA nanoparticles
were then incubated with streptavidin (34.25 μL, 2 g/L) on ice for 40 minutes under
magnetic stirring. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 5,000×g for 10 minutes and
washed with 1 mL PBS for 3 times to remove excess streptavidin. The pellet was
resuspended in 100 μL PBS and incubated with biotinylated ACE2 (Bioss Antibodies)
for 30 minutes on ice. The resulting PLA@DOPS/ biotin~SA~ACE2 nanoparticle was
termed as Nanotrap-ACE2.

Nanotrap-Antibody was synthesized by combining 15% DOPS (0.313 mg, 0.386 μmol),
50% DSPC (1.018 mg, 1.287 μmol), 30% cholesterol (0.300 mg, 0.773 μmol) and 5%
DSPE-PEG2000-NHS (0.370 mg, 0.129 μmol) in dichloromethane. The lipids mixtures
were vacuum dried overnight, and the resulting thin film was hydrated with PLA-NPs
PBS solution under ultrasonic water bath and further reacted with 100 μg of SARSCOV-2 neutralizing antibody for 4 hours at 4 ℃.

Characterization of Nanotraps
The sizes of Nanotraps were measured by a dynamic light scattering particle size
analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer). Briefly, 1 µL of Nanotraps were dispersed in 0.1× PBS
and further dispersed in ultrasonic water bath for 10 minutes before testing. The size
measurement was carried at 25 ℃ with count rates within 300-500 kcps and measured
3 times. The zeta potentials of Nanotraps were performed by a Möbiuζ system (Wyatt
Technology). The data were presented as mean ± SD.
AF488-labeled anti-ACE2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the
Nanotrap-ACE2 for 30 minutes on ice and centrifuged at 5,000×g for 10 min, the pellet
was washed with PBS for 3 times. The resulting Nanotraps were resuspended in 50%
glycol and imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (Nikon) with
488 nm and 647 nm excitation lasers and 200 milliseconds exposure. Line scans were
performed in Fiji.
The sizes and morphologies of the Nanotraps were studied by scanning electron
microscopy. Briefly, 10 μL of Nanotrap-ACE2 were diluted in MiliQ water and further
dispersed on ultrasonic water bath for 10 minutes before adding onto a silicon chip. 40
μL of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus was fixed by 4% PFA at 37 ℃ for 30
minutes, the virus was then washed by PBS 3 times using an Amicon Ultra-15

Centrifugal Filter (pore size 100 KDa) at 3,000×g, 10 minutes. The resulting fixed virus
was incubated with 10 μL Nanotraps-ACE2 at 37 ℃ for 1 hour and added onto the 1
cm2 silicon chip followed by airdrying overnight. After dehydration, the samples were
coated with 8 nm platinum/palladium by sputter coater (Cressington 208HR). The
scanning electronic microscope (Carl Zeiss Merlin) was used to image the morphology
of the Nanotraps with an accelerating voltage of 2.0 kV. For each sample, more than 10
measurements with different magnification were performed to ensure the repeatability
of the results.

Flow cytometry analysis of Nanotraps phagocytosis
Macrophage differentiation was conducted as follows(Hsu et al., 1996): THP-1 cells
were treated with 150 nM PMA for 24 hours and replaced by fresh culture medium for
another 24 hours. The differentiated THP-1 cells were harvested as dTHP-1
macrophages and maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PenicillinStreptomycin. The dTHP-1 macrophages were then released from the plate with
Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) and cell number was counted by a hemocytometer. 1 million
dTHP-1 macrophages were seeded into each 6-well plate overnight, and DiO-labeled
Nanotraps (200, 500, and 1200 nm) were incubated with dTHP-1 macrophages for 0,
24, or 48 hours. For phosphatidylserine investigation, dTHP-1 macrophages were
incubated with Nanotraps containing different phosphatidylserine molar ratios (0%, 5%,
10%, 15%) for 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, or 48 hours. The cells were harvested and washed 3 times
with PBS at 300×g for 5 minutes, and stained with Zombie NIR™ Fixable Viability Kit
(BioLegend) on ice for 10 minutes. Then cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS,
10% FBS, 0.1% NaN3) 2 times and resuspended in 200 µL FACS buffer. Flow
cytometry was carried on a BD LSRFortessa™ Flow Cytometer. Live and single cells

were gated and DiO fluorescence channel was used to indicate the phagocytosis
efficiency of different Nanotraps. The data were further analyzed by FlowJo (BD) and
Prism (Graphpad) softwares.

Lattice light-sheet microcopy imaging analysis of Nanotrap phagocytosis
For lattice light-sheet imaging, 4×104 dTHP-1 macrophages were seeded onto each
coverslip and DiD-labeled Nanotraps with different phosphatidylserine molar ratios
(0%, 10%, and 15%) were added for 24- or 48-hour incubation. The cells were washed
by PBS for 3 times, fixed with 4% PFA, stained with (5 μg/mL) CF488 Wheat Germ
Agglutinin (WGA) Conjugates (Biotium), and washed 3 times with HBSS. Coverslips
were imaged by lattice light-sheet microscopy (3i) using z+objective scanning. Imaging
was conducted with 488 nm and 647 nm lasers, with dither set to 3 and 20 millisecond
exposures. Z-steps (60) were collected with a 0.4 µm step size. Resulting images were
deconvolved as described previously(Rosenberg and Huang, 2020; Rosenberg et al.,
2020) using LLSpy (cudaDeconv) used under license from Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, Janelia Research Campus. Image reconstruction videos were made in Imaris
(Bitplane).

Production of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped VSV
Packaging cells (HEK293T) in serum-free DMEM were transfected with 9 μg
pCAGGS SARS-CoV-2 spike expression plasmid using polyethylenimine (PEI). After
24 hours, 3×107 FFU VSVdG*G-GFP virus was added to the HEK293T cells and
incubated for another 48 hours. Media were collected and spun at 500×g for 3 minutes
to remove cell debris, then passed through a 0.45 μm pore filter. The virus was then
stored in -80 C. To check the infection rate, HEK293T-ACE2 cells (Integral Cat# C-

HA102) were incubated with the final VSVdG-GFP*CoV2 pseudovirus and visualized
by the presence of GFP positive cells through direct microscopic imaging or flow
cytometry.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralizing assay
For SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped VSV neutralizing assay, 4×104 HEK293T-ACE2
cells (maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PenicillinStreptomycin) were seeded in a 96-well plate overnight. Different concentrations of
ACE2 proteins or Nanotraps (containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0,
12, 15 µg/mL ACE2) were incubated with 500 FFU SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped
VSV for 1 hour in 37 C. The virus-Nanotrap solution was added into the HEK293TACE2 cells and incubated for 24 hours (n=3 for each group). The cells were imaged
with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) using 10×/0.30 NA objective. The excitation
wavelengths were 470 ± 25 nm (Spectra X, Lumencor). The emissions of GFP were
captured by an Andor iXon Ultra 888 back-illuminated EMCCD camera (Oxford
Instruments). The number of GFP-positive cells were counted manually by objective
three times. The viral infection rates were calculated as the ratio of GFP-positive cells
in the group incubated to that of the group incubated with virus alone.
For SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus neutralizing assay, 1×104 HEK293TACE2 cells were seeded onto a 384-well plate overnight. Nanotraps or ACE2 was added
to SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (4 µL per well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. The
virus-Nanotrap solution was added to each well (n = 3 for each group). 72 hours later,
the plate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500×g to prevent cell loss. Supernatant was
aspirated and 35 µL of PBS was added. PBS was carefully aspirated, leaving ~15 µL of
liquid behind. Renilla-Glo assay substrate was added to the Assay Buffer at a 1:100

dilution, then 15 µL of the substrate:buffer was added to each well of a 384-well plate.
The bioluminescence was recorded by a microplate reader (Fisher Scientific BioTek
Cytation 5) with an exposure of 200 milliseconds. Wells infected with pseudovirus only
were normalized as 100%.

Co-culture assay
THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages as described above. Coculture was
carried out in a macrophage to A549 cell ratio of 1:5. 4×104 A549 cells were seeded in
an 18-well microslide (Vivid) overnight and 8×103 dTHP-1 macrophages were added
onto the A549 cells for another 6 hours. 500 FFU SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped VSV
was incubated with Nanotraps or PBS in 37 °C for 1 hour before adding to the coculture
cells. 24 hours later, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with CF532 Wheat
Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Conjugates (Biotium) and DAPI and imaged under a confocal
microscope (Leica SP8). Percent infectivity was quantified in FIJI by dividing GFP+
cells by total cell number (DAPI-stained nuclei). Each channel was processed as
follows: Image>Threshold (“Huang” preset(Huang and Wang)); Image>Binary>Fill
Holes; Image>Binary>Watershed; Analyze>Count Particles.

In vitro cytotoxicity assay
A549 or HEK293T-ACE2 cells (both maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin) were seed in a 96-well plate at a density of 1×104
cells/well in 100 μL of culture medium overnight. Nanotraps (3.8×107 particles/mL)
were added into cells and the cells were cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 72
hours.10 μL of CCK-8 (MedChem Express) solution was added to each well of the plate.
The plate was incubated for 2 hours in the incubator. Then it was put into a microplate

reader (Fisher Scientific BioTek Cytation 5) and the plate was gently shaken for 1
minute before measuring the absorbance at 450 nm. The cytotoxicity was calculated by
cell viability, that the relative absorbance from the control wells without Nanotraps
were normalized as 100%.

In vivo biosafety assays
C57BL/6NHsd mice at the age of 6 weeks were purchased from Envigo and maintained
at the Animal Facility of the University of Chicago. The animal study protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of University
of Chicago. To evaluate the safety of the Nanotraps, 2 male and 2 female 6-10-weekold C57BL/6NHsd mice were intratracheally administered with 10 mg/kg NanotrapACE2 in 50 µL PBS. Blood samples were collected by submandibular vein via cheek
punch using a commercially available 4 mm point lancet after three days. A small
aliquot of approximately 100 µL blood was collected into EDTA-containing
heparinized tubes, and red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets were counted by
a Hematology Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Act Diff 5 CP) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. For the comprehensive chemistry panels, blood was
allowed to coagulate in 4 C for 2 hours, and serum was collected after centrifugation
(1,000×g for 15 minutes) for analysis. Serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine
aminotransferase, amylase, urea nitrogen, calcium, cholesterol, glucose, total bilirubin,
total proteins were determined by a Vet Axcel blood chemistry analyzer (Alfa
Wasserman). Lungs, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney were collected from the same mice,
fixed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin. The resulting blocks were
cut in 5 μm sections and further stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by the
University of Chicago Human Tissue Research Center. Fluorescent imaging samples

were collected in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound on dried ice and stored in -80 C
before cryosectioning on a cryostat (Leica). The obtained 10 μm thick tissue slides were
then further stained with DAPI. The histology and fluorescence slides were scanned by
a CRi Pannoramic MIDI 20× whole slide scanner and analyzed on the QuPath software.

Ex vivo lung perfusion assay
Non-transplantable human lungs were obtained from deceased individuals provided by
the organ procurement organization Gift of Hope. All specimens and data were deidentified prior to receipt. This study was deemed exempt by the University of Chicago
Institutional Review Board (IRB19-1942).
Lung Harvest. Living lungs unsuitable for transplantation were harvested in standard
clinical fashion(Hsu et al., 1996) from deceased patients. Figure 5A shows the lung of
a 56-year-old male patient (87.2 kg, cause of death: brain death). Lungs were
transported to the laboratory at 4 C.
Lung inoculation. Tissue samples were collected from the edge of the right superior
lobe before perfusion as a untreated control; 500 µL SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped
lentivirus (Intergral Molecular, RVP 701) was resuspended in 5 mL PBS and injected
into the lingula of the left lung; 500 µL SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus was
first incubated with Nanotrap-Antibody carrying 250 µg neutralizing antibody for 1
hour at 37 C before inoculation. This mixture was then injected into the right middle
lobe. Tissue samples at all three sites were collected. Some samples were immersed in
MACS buffer for tissue dissociation, and other samples were fixed in 4% PFA, sliced
and stained for H&E.

Lung perfusion. The lung bloc was perfused according to published techniques(Cypel
et al., 2008; Ross et al., 2019). A centrifugal pump was used to perfuse the pulmonary
artery with deoxygenated cellular perfusate (1×Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium
containing 4.5g/K D-glucose, L-glutamine and 110 mg/L of sodium pyruvate, with
addition of 5% bovine serum albumin and 2 units of packed red blood cells). The left
atrium was left open for gravity drainage. The trachea was incubated and the lung was
ventilated with volume control ventilation (tidal volume set at 6-8 mL/weight of ideal
body weight (kg) of donor, respiratory rate of 8-13, and fraction of inspired oxygen set
at 21%). Sweep gas composed of 8% CO2, 3% O2, 89% N2 was connected to the hollowfiber de-oxygenator heat exchanger to remove oxygen and add in CO2 into the perfusate
returning back to the lung. After initiation of perfusion with gradual warming and
increasing pump flow over 30 minutes, the lung bloc was maintained at 37 °C with
pump flow calibrated to pulmonary artery pressure of 10 – 20 mmHg for 8 hours.
Sampling. Perfusate was sampled at serial time points from the pulmonary artery and
left atrium. Differences in oxygen content between perfusate samples were used to
calculate the oxygenation capacity of the lung. Airway pressure was measured
periodically to calculate lung compliance based on tidal volume. Tissue samples were
collected from treated and untreated lobes of the lung at time 0 and time 8 hours of
perfusion.
Sample Processing. After 8 hours perfusion, tissues were harvested as described above.
Tissue dissociation was performed by mechanical digestion in DMEM media treated
with 2.5 U/mL DNase (company); samples were passed through 70 µm cell strainers
(Fisher Scientific). Red blood cells were lysed in 10 mL RBC lysis buffer (Life
Technologies), washed 3 times in DMEM (300×g for 3 minutes), and resuspended in

10 mL DMEM. Cells were counted with a hemocytometer and immediately used for
luciferase assay or cryopreserved in Cell Banker medium (Amsbio) at a density of
4×106 cells/mL.
For luciferase assay, the cells harvested as described above were washed with PBS
(300×g for 3 minutes) 3 times. Then 2×104 cells were seeded into 96-well plate. RenillaGlo Assay Substrate was added to the Assay Buffer at a 1:100 dilution, then 30 µL of
the Substrate Buffer was added to each well for 10 minutes. The bioluminescence from
each well was detected by a microplate reader (Fisher Scientific BioTek Cytation 5)
with an exposure of 200 milliseconds.
Primary cells harvested from the untreated right superior lobe of the human lung were
further used for infection analyses. Briefly, 1×104 primary lung cells were seeded onto
a 384-well plate. 20 μL Nanotraps-Antibody (3.8×107 particles/mL) was added to 10
μL SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus (Intergral Molecular, RVP 701) per well
and incubated for 1 hour at 37 ℃ before adding to the cells. For virus only group, 10
μL SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus was added to the cells. 48 hours later,
the plate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 500×g to prevent cell loss. Supernatant was
aspirated and 35 µL PBS was added. PBS was carefully aspirated, leaving ~15 µL of
liquid behind. Renilla-Glo Assay Substrate was added to the Assay Buffer at a 1:100
dilution, then 15 µL of the Substrate:Buffer was added to each well of a 384-well plate.
The bioluminescence was recorded by a microplate reader (Fisher Scientific BioTek
Cytation 5) with an exposure of 200 milliseconds. The infectivity was calculated by the
relative luminescence intensity: wells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus only
were normalized as 100%.

All SARS-CoV-2 infections were performed in biosafety level 3 conditions at the
University of Chicago Howard T. Ricketts Regional Biocontainment Laboratory.
African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Nanotraps or neutralizing antibodies
were serially diluted 2-fold and mixed with 400 PFU of SARS-CoV-2
(nCoV/Washington/1/2020, kindly provided by the National Biocontainment
Laboratory, Galveston, TX) for one hour at 37 ºC, then used to infect Vero E6 cells for
three days. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formalin and stained with 0.25% crystal violet.
Crystal violet stained cells were then quantified by absorbance at (595 nm) with a Tecan
m200 microplate reader. Cell survival was calculated by normalizing untreated cells to
100%.

Figure 1: Schematic design, synthesis, and characterization of Nanotraps for
SARS-CoV-2. (A) Schematic illustration showing the process of the Nanotraps with
polymeric core coated with lipid-bilayer functionalized with ACE2 protein/neutralizing
antibody. Following intratracheal administration, Nanotraps efficiently accumulated
and trapped SARS-CoV-2 virionsin the lung tissue forming virus-Nanotrap complexes,
which can be cleared by macrophages via phagocytosis, thereby blocking viral cellentry. (B-C) Dynamic light scattering (B) and Zeta-potential measurements (C) during
different stages of Nanotrap preparation. (D) Fluorescent images of the prepared
Nanotraps with PLA polymeric core (DiD, red) and ACE2 (anti-ACE2-AF488, green).
Scale bar represents 5 µm. Dotted lines represent displayed plot profile below. (E-F)
Pseudocolored SEM images of Nanotraps alone (E, orange) or with SARS-CoV-2
pseudovirus (F, cyan). To better visualize the selectivity for viral binding, larger
Nanotraps were imaged. Scale bar represents 300 nm.
