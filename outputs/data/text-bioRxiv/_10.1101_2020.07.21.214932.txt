Abstract
The SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the current COVID19 pandemic has been
reported to have a relatively low mutation rate. Nevertheless, a few prevalent variants
have arisen that give the appearance of undergoing positive selection as they are
becoming increasingly widespread over time. Most prominent among these is the
D614G amino acid substitution in the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which mediates viral
entry. The D614G substitution, however, is in linkage disequilibrium with the ORF1b
P314L mutation where both mutations almost invariably co-occur, making functional
inferences problematic. In addition, the possibility of repeated new introductions of the
mutant strain does not allow one to distinguish between a founder effect and an intrinsic
genetic property of the virus. Here, we synthesized and expressed the WT and D614G
variant SARS-Cov2 Spike protein, and report that using a SARS-CoV2 Spike protein
pseudotyped lentiviral vector we observe that the D614G variant Spike has >1/2 log10
increased infectivity in human cells expressing the human ACE2 protein as the viral
receptor. The increased binding/fusion activity of the D614G Spike protein was
corroborated in a cell fusion assay using Spike and ACE2 proteins expressed in
different cells. These results are consistent with the possibility that the Spike D614G
mutant increases the infectivity of SARS-CoV2.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus that initiated the current global pandemic, appeared in
late 2019 in Hubei province, China(1)(2). The epidemic experienced a fast growth early
on in the city of Wuhan as its epicenter in late 2019 and early January 2020 and then
declined in China as a whole by the second half of February 2020. By the time the
epidemic reached Europe, a variant strain had appeared that carried a missense
mutation in the Spike glycoprotein that substituted the aspartate at position 614 for a
glycine in isolates identified in Germany, Italy and Mexico (3). This mutation is in linkage
disequilibrium with the ORF1b gene P314L substitution. In almost all cases ORF1b
P314L and Spike D614G variants co-occur. The Spike glycoprotein is a type I
membrane protein and the largest surface protein of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus. It
mediates infection of target cells through binding to its cognate receptor angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then initiating viral-host cell membrane fusion (4).
After the appearance of the Spike D614G variant in the latter course of the Chinese
epidemic, over time in most examined local epidemics an enrichment of the 614G Spike
protein variant over the original 614D variant has been observed, leading to the
hypothesis that the Spike D614G mutation is positively selected (5)(Supplemental
movie, https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=gt-S_614 )(6). The caveat, however, is that
due to possible multiple introductions and reintroduction events a founder effect could
also explain the observed viral strain dynamics. Here, we present evidence that the
D614G Spike mutant displays a slightly increased infectivity (~5X) in ACE2-expressing
cells without a contribution of the ORF1b P314L mutation, when tested in pseudotyped
lentiviral vectors. This result provides a plausible mechanism for the increased observed
infectivity inferred from epidemiological observations and is consistent with the positive
selection hypothesis of the D614G mutation.
Results
The Spike protein is the largest structural protein of the SARS-CoV2 virus (2). This type
I trimeric membrane protein mediates the viral entry into target cells through the binding
of its primary receptor ACE2, and possibly also interaction with additional receptors or
co-receptors (7). Activation of the Spike protein for receptor binding, requires proteolytic
processing by serine proteases, such as furin, at the polybasic site during its secretion
from the producer cells, or alternatively by the target cell plasma membrane TMPRSS2
protease or endosomal proteases such as cathepsins, into the S1 and S2 domains (4,
8). Upon binding to the ACE2 receptor, the S1 domain is shed and the S2 domain is
exposed. The S2 domain has to be further proteolytically activated to expose the fusion
peptide, which initiates membrane fusion of the viral and host cell membranes to
mediate viral entry into the cytoplasm (8). The D614G mutation on the Spike protein is
located at the C-terminus of the S1 fragment and outside of the receptor-binding
domain, and thus is unlikely to directly influence ACE2 binding.
Cell biology of Spike-mediated fusion
Expression of the Spike glycoprotein (GP) in 293T cells invariably led to some amount
of cell fusion. This was observed in transient transfection (Figure 1A) as well as in a
stable cell line generated by infection with a lentiviral vector expressing Spike GP

(Figure 1B). The majority of expressed Spike GP was located in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) as seen by calnexin colocalization in methanol-permeabilized cells
(Figure 1A). Spike was also observed on the nuclear membrane and to a lesser extent
on the plasma membrane. Staining cells without permeabilization showed that Spike is
readily expressed on the plasma membrane, in the absence of any other viral protein,
and therefore should be capable of mediating cell fusion (Fig. 1A right panel). We did
not observe any significant localization differences between Spike WT and Spike
D614G in transiently transfected cells. Higher levels of expression led to aberrant ER
morphology probably due to ER-ER fusion events. In addition, we observed fusion of
the outer nuclear membrane leading to syncytia with aggregated nuclei (Figure 1B).
To test the activity of the SARS Cov2 protein in vitro, we used a cell fusion assay in
which 293T cells were either transfected with Spike or transfected with the Spike
receptor ACE2 (8). In order to distinguish and visualize the Spike and ACE2-expressing
cells, the Spike protein was co-transfected with EGFP and the ACE2 protein
cotransfected with TdTomato. Cells were mixed, plated and then observed by
immunofluorescence microscopy or Fluorescence Aided Cell Sorting (FACS) 24 hours
after plating. The experiments were performed with both the original Spike 614D variant
GP as well as the Spike 614G mutant GP, and mouse ACE2 and human ACE2 were
compared. Mixing of both mouse and human ACE2-expressing cells with Spike GP
expressing cells led to an increase in syncytia frequency as well as size, i.e. syncytia
with more nuclei, as observed by microscopy (Figure 1C). Both of these effects
appeared to be further increased using human ACE2 compared to mouse ACE2. FACS
analysis showed that transfection of Spike GP increased red/green double positive
events indicative of fusion 7-8X. Inclusion of the mouse ACE2 in the TdTomato cells
increased the fusions to ~17-18X over the baseline without Spike (Figure 1E). Use of
the human ACE2 only increased measured fusion events 5-6X due to the loss of the
large syncytia (Figure 1E). In order to quantify the extent of fusion, we measured the
depletion of syncytia rather than counting fused cells, as Spike-mediated fusion
produced syncytia that were frequently large enough to be lost during passage through
the FACS preparation mesh filters designed to eliminate cellular aggregates. Using this
assay we observed an increase in fusion cell depletion when target cells were
transfected with either mouse or human ACE2. Fusion efficiency was higher with human
ACE2, but mouse ACE2 enhancement of fusion was clearly detectable by this assay,
consistent with microscopy observations. The difference between Spike GP 614D and
614G with mouse ACE2 was not significant (p = 0.0722). With the human ACE2
however, we observed an 11% enhancement of D614G GFP+ cell depletion compared
to WT Spike, which although small in magnitude achieved statistical significance (p
<0.02) (Figure 1F).
Spike pseudotyped lentiviral vectors
In order to obtain a better dynamic range assay, we generated SARS-CoV2
pseudotyped lentiviral vectors that incorporated Spike GP as their envelope protein
carrying a payload expressing EGFP under the CAG promoter. This pseudotyped viral
vector was used to infect mouse and human ACE2 expressing cells (9). The Spike
pseudotyped lentiviral vector physical titer was normalized to HIV p24 Gag protein prior
to infection for all viral vectors generated. Comparison of infection efficiencies of control

293T cells with stable cells expressing either mouse or human ACE2 demonstrated an
increased infection efficiency (15X) in the human ACE2 expressing cells over the 293T
cell background. A similar increase was not observed in mouse ACE2-expressing cells.
Comparison of Spike 614G with Spike 614D showed a consistently enhanced infectivity
of the Spike 614G variant (~5X) (Figure 2A) Co-transfection of TMPRSS2 in 293T cells
did not enhance infectivity suggesting that proteolytic processing is not limiting in these
cells (data not shown). Comparison of proteolytic processing of 614D and 614G Spike
proteins by immunoblotting with an antibody against a juxtamembrane epitope on
partially purified pseudotyped lentiviral vector virions showed neither enrichment of
Spike incorporation nor proteolytic processing differences. This was observed both with
partially purified viral particles as well as in viral supernatants (Figure 2B).
Discussion
The emergence of the SARS-CoV2 Spike D614G and its rapid increase in prevalence
has been striking (5). Observational population genetics alone could not resolve
whether this mutation and/or the frequently co-occurring ORF1b P314L allele alter
biological activity or are just an epiphenomenon underlying a founder effect due to
repeated introductions. Here, in the present report we find functional evidence that the
Spike D614G mutant has modestly different biochemical properties consistent with
positive selection of the D614G mutant SARS-CoV2 virus variant. The increase in cell
entry activity of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors and cell fusion allowed us to dissect the
Spike protein function in isolation and test the activity of the D614G point mutation. In
our work we observed no increases in expression, increased stoichiometry of Spike
incorporation into pseudotyped viral vector particles, nor proteolytic processing that
could account for the increased infectivity. In contrast, other reports have respectively
reported increases and decreases in S2 proteolytic processing (10–14). Given the
location of the 614 residue within the S1 fragment distal to the RBD, it is also unlikely
that the D614G mutation directly affects the ACE2 binding activity. Also unlikely is an
affect on the S2’ proteolytic processing that activates the fusion peptide, as the S1
fragment with the 614 site is already released before S2’ proteolytic processing can
occur. Not yet investigated are the post-binding steps leading to the release of S1
before the S2’ activation of the fusion peptide. Thus, a biochemical basis for increased
infectivity is observed in the SARS-CoV2 D614G mutant consistent with positive
selection observed in the field. Nevertheless, we cannot currently explain the basis for
this increased infectivity, and therefore further work is needed to clarify the mechanistic
basis of the increased infectivity.
Methods
Pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were prepared, titered and partially purified as described
in Tiscornia et al. (15). For small scale production, calcium phosphate transfection was
substituted for Lipofectamine LTX using the manufacturer’s recommended conditions.
The Spike protein gene sequence was synthesized based on the original US isolate
SARS-CoV2 hCoV19_USA EPI_ISL_414366 (GISAID) with human codon optimization

and the addition of a C-terminal HA tag (IDT), and cloned by Gibson assembly using the
NEB kit into the lentiviral pBOB-CAG vector. The D614G substitution was introduced
with a single gBlock spanning the AspI and RsrII sites and Gibson assembly (NEB).
Pseudotyping plasmids were generated by deletion of the external CMV promoter and
5’ LTR leaving the internal CAG promoter by restriction digestion, and self-ligation.
A stable Spike expressing 293T cell line was generated by infection with pBOB-CAGSARS-CoV2-Spike-HA lentiviral vector https://www.addgene.org/141347/ followed by
single cell cloning and screening by cell extract immunoblotting of individual clones with
HA tag antibody (CST #3724). Immunofluorescence was performed following the Cell
Signaling Technology protocol (https://www.cellsignal.com/). Primary antibodies were
GeneTex 632604 anti-Spike antibody (mouse monoclonal) and anti-calnexin (C5C9)
rabbit mAb (CST #2679) were detected with 2nd anti-Mouse IgG Alexa 488 (Life tech
Cat# A11029) and anti-rabbit IgG Dylight 633 (Thermo Fisher #35563) antibodies.
Imaging was performed with Zeiss AiryScan 880 microscope. Human and mouse ACE2
expressing cell lines were generated by lentiviral vector (pLV-human-ACE2 IRES Puro
or pLV-mouse-ACE2 IRES Puro, gifts from Dr. Sumit Chanda) transduction followed by
puromycin selection. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher’s 2 tailed T-test
on MS Excel.
