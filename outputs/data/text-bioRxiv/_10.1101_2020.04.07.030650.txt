Abstract
By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic
SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the
brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated
the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain
transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively
highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular
nuclei of the thalamus. According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of
ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some
non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in human
middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were
found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for
the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as
well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of
Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an
outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain
infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Potential species differences should be
considered when using mouse models to study the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Introduction
Since December 2019, much attention has focused on the novel SARS-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and related coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is rapidly
spreading around the world and resulted in a global health emergency

[1]

. In addition to

atypical pneumonia, the central nervous system (CNS) symptoms of COVID-19 patients have
been observed in the clinic [2]. According to a recent retrospective case series study, 53 out of
214 (24.8%) COVID-19 patients had CNS symptoms, including dizziness, headache,
impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and epilepsy

[3]

. More

importantly, it has been found that SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a previous similar
coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2, spread into the brain after it was cleared from the lung in mice,
which could be more concealment than that in the lung [4]. Recently, Puelles et al. found that
SARS-CoV-2 has an organotropism beyond the respiratory tract, including the kidneys, liver,
heart, and brain[5]. Thus, it is necessary and urgent to pay attention to the CNS infection of
SARS-CoV-2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2) has been identified as a key entry
receptor for novel pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 as well as previous SARS-coronavirus
(SARS-CoV)

[6]

. By binding of the spike protein of the virus to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 and

SARS-CoV could invade host cells in human organs [7, 8]. However, the distribution of ACE2
in the brain is still obscure and even inconsistent. Hamming et al. found ACE2 may be
express only in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells in the human brain tissue in
2004 [9]. Since then, few studies focused on the distribution of ACE2 in the human brain. On
the other hand, a previous study has reported that Ace2 could express in mouse neuron cells,
which may contribute to the development of hypertension

[10]

; however, in another

neurocytometry study, Ace2 is a potential marker for non-neurons in zinc-fixed mouse brain
cortical section

[11]

. Thus, further clarifying brain tissue distribution of ACE2 may help to

bring light to the CNS infection of the novel SARS-CoV-2 and previous SARS-CoV.
Here, we investigated the distribution of ACE2 in the brain by analyzing publicly
available brain transcriptome databases. We revealed an uneven spatial and cell-type
distribution of ACE2 in the human and mouse brain.

Spatial and cell-type distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain
Allen mouse brain atlas database (http://mouse.brain-map.org) was used to analyze the
general spatial distribution of Ace2 in the mouse brain. Four cell-type sequencing datasets
from hippocampus RNA-seq atlas, (https://hipposeq.janelia.org/), five single-cell sequencing
datasets form Single Cell Portal database and one dataset Mouse brain atlas
(http://mousebrain.org) were used for cell-type distribution of Ace2 in the mouse brain. The
summary of the used five single-cell sequencing datasets was also shown in Table 2.

Data processing and statistical analysis
Datasets were independently searched and analyzed by two authors (R.C. and J.Y.) and
any disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus with the corresponding author
(Z.X.). The data from the Allen human brain atlas database and Allen Cell Types Database
was exported to Microsoft Excel 2017 and GraphPad Prism 6.0 for further analysis. ACE2
expression data from the Allen human and mouse brain atlas database were also imported to
Brain Explorer 2.0 software to get visualization. The data from the other databases were

analyzed online.
To minimize false positive of expression as previous studies [24, 25], a gene with calculate
counts per million (CPM), transcripts per million (TPM), unique molecular identifier (UMI)
count or Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) > 1 were considered to be positive, which
also is the same as log10 (CPM), log10 (TPM) or log10 (UMI) ≥ 0 as well as log10 (CPM+1),
log10 (TPM+1), and log10 (UMI+1) ≥0.3. Besides, as Z score being greater than 2
corresponds to a p-value < 0.05, Z score of ACE2 expression > 2 were considered as high
ACE2 expression in Allen human brain atlas data. Where applicable, data are expressed as
median or mean. Interquartile range (IQR), 95%CI, range, and/or all sample points, were also
provided if possible.

Results
The general expression of ACE2 in the human brain.
According to the GETx portal database

[15]

, compared with the lung, the general

expression of ACE2 was lowe but not none in the brain (Figure 1A). The expression intensity
of ACE2 was similar among different brain regions. Excepted for the lung (38 out of 578,
6.57%), the samples with log10(TMP+1) of ACE2 expression >0.3 were also found in
amygdala (1 out of 152, 0.65%), anterior cingulate cortex (2 out of 176, 1.14%), caudate (3
out of 246, 1.22%), cortex (1 out of 255, 0.39%), frontal cortex (2 out of 209, 0.96%),
hippocampus (4 out of 197, 2.03%), hypothalamus (3 out of 202, 1.49%), nucleus accumbens
(1 out of 246, 0.41%), putamen (1 out of 205, 0.48%), spinal cord (cervical c-1, 4 out of 159,
2.52%), substantial nigra (5 out of 139, 3.60%), but none in cerebellum (0 out of 241) and
cerebellar hemisphere (0 out of 215).
Besides, according to the Human Brain Transcriptome database

[13]

, the expression of

ACE2 was also similar among cortex and other brain regions, which may not change a lot
with the age (Figure 1B and C).

(A_23_P252981, CUST_16267_PI416261804) were found and used in Allen Human Brain

expression, we found six brain areas with a maximal z score of ACE2 expression >2.0 in both
probe datasets, 15 brain areas with a maximal z score of ACE2 expression >2.0 only in
probe1 datasets, and 9 which represents ACE2 expression in probe1 datasets. Z score of
ACE2 expression >2.0 means that these brain areas are 2 standard deviations greater than the
mean, which corresponds to a p-value < 0.05 (Figure 2A and B).

By pooled the expression value of the two datasets, we further found 23 brain areas with
z score >1.0 and four of them with z score >2.0 (Figure 3A). The distribution view of ACE2

and hippocampus samples (totally 0.21% ACE2 positive cells, 2 out of 9530).
For the cell types, most of the ACE2 positive cells are neurons in both human middle
temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, especially excitatory neurons (72.1% for
middle temporal gyrus and 66.1% for posterior cingulate cortex, Figure 4A and B) and
interneurons (22.4% for middle temporal gyrus and 9.8% for posterior cingulate cortex,
Figure 4A and B). The percentage of positive cells in excitatory neurons was also the highest
among cell types (2.14% for middle temporal gyrus and 2.18% for the posterior cingulate
cortex, Figure 4C). The details of the cell-type distribution of ACE2 in the human brain were
shown in Supplementary Figures 1 and 2.

(https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP478),

and

cerebellum

(https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP795). Similar to human data, the
expression of Ace2 is relatively high in multiple mouse cortex samples (totally 0.84% Ace2
positive cells, 84 out of 10000), but it is relatively low in mixed mouse prefrontal cortex and
hippocampus samples (totally 0.28% Ace2 positive cells, 38 out of 13313) and mouse
hippocampus samples (totally 0.1% Ace2 positive cells, 2 out of 1188). Besides, the
expression of Ace2 is also found in 0.68% cell in mixed SNr, SNc, and VTA areas as well as
0.52% in the cerebellum.
For the cell-types distribution, most of the Ace2 positive cells are endothelial cells in the
multiple mouse cortex samples, the mixed prefrontal cortex and hippocampus samples, the
mixed SNr, SNc and VTA areas and the cerebellum (Figure 6). The percentage of positive
cells in endothelial cells was the highest among different cell types in most mouse brain. Of
note, the neurons also account for a relatively large proportion of total Ace2 positive cells in
multiple cortex samples (48.8%) and mixed prefrontal cortex and hippocampus samples
(15%), the mixed SNr, SNc, and VTA areas (10.5%) and the cerebellum (7.69%) in mouse
brain. The details of the cell-type distribution of Ace2 in the mouse brain are shown in
Supplementary Figure 3. Similarly, in a comprehensive atlas of the mouse nervous system,
of the 265 cell clusters, four had an expression Z score > 2 (three pericyte clusters and a
cluster of arterial endothelial cells[23]).
In addition, as the inconsistent results were found in the hippocampus based on the
single-cell sequencing, we additionally analyzed the expression of Ace2 in a cell-type
sequencing database of the mouse hippocampus, the Hippocampus RNA-seq atlas database
(https://hipposeq.janelia.org; Cembrowski et al., 2016). As shown in Supplementary Figure
4, (1) Ace2 expression was only found in intermediate and ventral areas of the hippocampus
with the mean FPKM<1; (2) Ace2 expression were found in ventral pyramidal cells but not in

Discussion
ACE2 is an important entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infecting host
organs [6]. Though the infection of SARS-COV in the brain was reported in the past [26, 27], the
distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still unclear. Here we mainly found: (1) The expression of
ACE2 was relatively high in several specific brain areas in human; (2) the expression of
ACE2 mainly located in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) in human
middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, but the ACE2-expressing cells were
none in PFC and very few in the hippocampus; (3) Except for the additional expression of
ACE2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution and the pericytes and endothelial
cells for cell-type distribution analysis, the main distribution figure of ACE2 in mouse brain
was similar to that in human. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2 distribution in the
human and mouse brain, which supports the hypothesis that the SARS-CoV-2 is capable to
infect the brain and may result in CNS symptoms in COVID-19 patients [28].
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 77.2% amino acid identity, 72.8% sequence identity, and high

structural similarity to previous SARS-CoV

[29, 30]

. Similar to SARS-CoV, experimental

affinity measurements show a high affinity of the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2
and ACE2

[30, 31]

. Here we found the percent of ACE2 positive samples were found in most

brain areas, especially substantial nigra was almost comparable to that of the lung (3.60% vs
6.57%), though the total expression in the brain seems much lower than that in the lung.
According to Allen brain atlas, the total expression of ACE2 seems not to change with age.
Six brain areas with a Z score of ACE2 expression >2 in both probe data and four brain areas
were Z score of ACE2 expression >2 in pooled data. Some brain nuclei are very important for
the normal brain functions, including the paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus (involved in
the control of wakefulness, feeding, appetitive motivation, drug addiction, regulation of stress
and negative emotional behavior, and epilepsy[32,

33]

), the raphe nuclei (the main

serotoninergic nuclei in the brain[34]), and tuberomammillary nucleus (the main histaminergic
nuclei in the brain [35]). Thus, our results highlight the importance of spatial distribution rather
than the general total expression of ACE2 in the brain. These results may provide some clues
to further study on the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 patients, and
suggesting SARS-CoV-2 might be able to result in serious CNS symptoms in COVID-19
patients (if it could infect these important brain areas by binding ACE2). Brain imaging and
long-term follow up may be needed in COVID-19 patients for the possibility of SARS-CoV-2
brain infection and the following brain disorders.
The routes or pathways for SARS-CoV and novel SARS-CoV-2 entering the brain are
still unclear. According to experiments in mice transgenic for human ACE2, intranasally
given SARS-CoV may enter the brain by olfactory nerves [36]. Consistent with this, we found
the expression of ACE2 in the olfactory bulb is higher than that in most other cortexes
(Figure 3). In the human brain, we found the piriform cortex, a brain area directly connected
with olfactory bulb, was ACE2 high-expression. Though no ACE2 expression data of
olfactory bulb in humans was available, our results indirectly support the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 might enter the human brain by olfactory nerves. On the other hand, we
additionally found the central glial substance and choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle were
with very high ACE2 expression (Z score > 5) in the human brain. Relatively high expression
of ACE2 in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle was also found in the mouse brain in

the current study. The central glial substance refers to an area of grey matter surrounding the
central canal, which carries CSF and helps to transport nutrients to the spinal cord

[37]

;

Besides, the choroid plexus of ventricles is an important brain area for the generation of CSF
[38]

, the main location of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier

immune cells entering the brain

[39]

, and a crucial gateway for

[40]

. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 has also been found in

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from a 56-year-old COVID-19 patient by genetic
sequencing

in

China

(http://www.ecns.cn/news/society/2020-03-05/detail-ifzuhesu4119860.shtml). SARS-CoV-2
may also infect the brain in a 24-year-old male patient [25]. Thus, our results suggest the high
expression of ACE2 in the central glial substance and ventricles may provide another
potential pathway for the SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV entering CSF and/or spreading around
the brain.
Single-nucleus RNA-seq provides a high resolution of cellular gene-expression of each
cell

[41]

. According to single-nucleus RNA-seq data, we further found that ACE2 located in

many neurons (especially excitatory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (especially
astrocytes and ODCs) in both posterior cingulate cortex and middle temporal gyrus, where
the expression level of ACE2 seems low under normal conditions. Here, the highest number
of ACE2 positive cells were excitatory neurons, which may be projection neurons that make
up many important brain networks. For example, excitatory neurons in the posterior cingulate
cortex may project dense connections to the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal
cortex, which are related to emotion and memory [42]. On the other hand, though the positive
cell number of inhibitory neurons is lower than excitatory neurons, the percentage of positive
cells in some sub-types inhibitory neuron were comparable or slightly low compared with
excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons are also crucial for normal brain function

[43]

. For

example, the neurons in SNr are mainly inhibitory GABAergic neurons, which is one
important note in the neural circuits that contribute to epilepsy

[33]

. Besides, we also found

some dopaminergic neurons and cerebellar cells in the mouse brain are also ACE2-positive.
Thus, our results may help to explain the previous finding that SARS-CoV particles are
mainly located in the neurons in the brain samples from SARS patients

[26]

, and suggest

SARS-CoV-2 may also invade many neurons in the human brain and hence contribute to the

CNS symptoms in COVID-19 patients.
In addition, single-nucleus RNA-seq data showed that the ACE2 was found in very few
endothelial cells and pericytes in the human brain, while endothelial cells and pericytes were
the main Ace2-expression cell types in the mouse brain. Of note, previous microarray data
shows ACE2 expressed in the human endothelium

[9]

. Endothelial cells are the main

component of blood vessel endothelium. Thus, one possible reason for these differences
could be that most blood vessels may be excluded from the tested human brain tissues while
they may be hard to be removed in the mouse brain. Both endothelial cells and pericytes are
closely related to the blood-brain barrier integrity

[44]

. Endothelial cells and pericytes could

also build blocks of the neurovascular unit together with astrocytes and neurons

[45]

. Thus,

endothelial cells and pericytes may help the SARS-CoV-2 to enter the brain by crossing the
BBB and also infect the neurovascular unit, which may contribute to the cerebrovascular
events in COVID-19 patients

[46]

. Taken together, as there is no enough evidence supporting

the ACE2 high expression in endothelial cells and pericytes in the human brain, further
studies remain needed. The CSF biomarkers of pericytes injury and blood-brain barrier
integrity, such as sPDGFRβ and albumin respectively

[47]

, may be needed to detect whether

SARS-CoV-2 damaged the BBB in COVID-19 patients in future studies. Besides, such a
potential difference between humans and mice should be noted when using mouse models for
the SARS-CoV-2 study.
Conclusions
Our results reveal an outline of ACE2 or Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse
brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 might be capable to infect the brain
and result in CNS symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The finding of high ACE2 expression in
central glial substance and brain ventricles suggests two potential novel routes for the
SARS-CoV-2 entering the CSF and/or spreading around the brain. Besides, the differences of
ACE2/Ace2 distribution between humans and mice may be also useful to further “bench to
bedside” translational studies regarding SARS-CoV-2. Our results may help to bring light to
the brain infection of the present novel SARS-CoV-2 and previous SARS-CoV. Further
studies are warranted to confirm our results and related predictions.
