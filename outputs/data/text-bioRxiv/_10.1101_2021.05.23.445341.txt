Abstract
Genomic data analysis is a fundamental system for monitoring pathogen evolution and the
outbreak of infectious diseases. Based on bioinformatics and deep learning, this study was
designed to identify the genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide and predict the
impending mutation rate. Analysis of 259044 SARS-CoV-2 isolates identify 3334545 mutations
(14.01 mutations per isolate), suggesting a high mutation rate. Strains from India showed the
highest no. of mutations (48) followed by Scotland, USA, Netherlands, Norway, and France
having up to 36 mutations. Besides the most prominently occurring mutations (D416G, F106F,
P314L, and UTR:C241T), we identify L93L, A222V, A199A, V30L, and A220V mutations
which are in the top 10 most frequent mutations. Multi-nucleotide mutations GGG>AAC,
CC>TT, TG>CA, and AT>TA have come up in our analysis which are in the top 20 mutational
cohort. Future mutation rate analysis predicts a 17%, 7%, and 3% increment of C>T, A>G, and
A>T, respectively in the future. Conversely, 7%, 7%, and 6% decrement is estimated for T>C,
G>A, and G>T mutations, respectively. T>G\A, C>G\A, and A>T\C are not anticipated in the
future. Since SARS-CoV-2 is evolving continuously, our findings will facilitate the tracking of
mutations and help to map the progression of the COVID-19 intensity worldwide.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) is the culprit for the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19
disease which is a respiratory like disease showing pneumonia-like symptoms and was first
recorded in December 2019 in Wuhan, China 1. The single-stranded RNA genome of this
infectious agent contains several ORF encoding structural as well as non-structural proteins.
Spike glycoprotein (S), Envelop protein (E), Membrane protein (M), Nucleocapsid protein are
the structural proteins whereas 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease and RNAdependent RNA polymerase are the non-structural proteins 2.
Conscious of becoming an international health emergency, the World Health Organization
(WHO) proclaimed COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11th March 2020. From then the virus has now
spread to over 223 nations and territories (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019/situation-reports). A disparity was found in cases of mortality in various
countries, perhaps because of a different demographic makeup and the form of strategies adopted
in different countries to restrict the transmission of the virus 3. According to the WHO
166,840,355 confirmed cases of Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) have been reported with
3,464,312 death worldwide by May 22, 2021 (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The
varying infection outcome, mechanism of transmission and time of incubation collectively have
reinforced the capability of the virus to spread effectively across the world. This issue of the high
virus transmissibility from one human to another is being constantly addressed by the researchers
4

.

SARS-CoV-2 shows a higher mutation and evaluation rate than that of its hosts, making it able
to adapt against the immune system within the host body. Mutation can be occurred due to
certain errors in SARS-CoV-2 genome during the replication process, specifically the time of
copying RNA to a new cell 5. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), Insertion, and Deletion are
the main type of mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be divided into
silent/nonsense (synonymous SNP), missense (non-synonymous SNP), and frameshift subclasses
6

. In viral evolution mutation rate is one of the critical parameters and the micro-level alteration

in the mutation rate can change the characteristics of the virus and virulence dramatically in the
host immune systems 7. A precise assessment of the mutation rate therefore becomes significant
to assume the risk of emerging infectious diseases like SARS- CoV-2 8.

SARS-Cov-2 has a strong nucleotide identity (96%) with bat coronavirus and for little
dissimilarity. The virus may have gone through a process of adaptation and this provides
opportunity to the virus to jump species boundaries and cause disease in humans

2,9

. There was

little evidence of local or regional adaptation throughout the initial phylogenomic study of three
main clades (S, V, and G) of Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) separated
from outbreaks of multiple geographic locations (China, USA, and Europe) within SARS-CoV2, proposing instead that viral evolution is driven solely by genetic drift and founding events.
Even so, several reports anticipate possible nucleotide, amino acid (aa) adaptation, and structural
heterogeneity in viral proteins, notably in spike protein

10-12

. There are numerous deletions

observed in the SARS-CoV-2 variants from different geographic locations. In a Singapore case
cluster, a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion was detected in January to
February 2020 and also detected in a traveler who returned from Wuhan, China, to Taiwan in
February 2020

13,14

, which is responsible for decollate the ORF7b and preventing the

transcription of ORF8 by eliminating the transcription-regulatory sequence of ORF8 and this
variant was not detected after the march, 2020 though it was successfully transmitted. ORF8
deletion in multiple SARS-CoV-2 isolates identified in the cases of Bangladesh (345
nucleotides), Australia (138 nucleotides), and Spain (62 nucleotides)

14

. Unique or multiple

SARS-CoV-2 clades or mutation(s) and clinical symptoms of COVID-19 observed between
countries thus it is important to integrate sequence determination of related infectious genome
with patient clinical knowledge (sequence polymorphisms and symptoms) to have the best
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity

1,9,15-17

. In addition, genomic sequence and

mutation analysis are critical for the inventing of proper drugs and vaccines against this RNA
virus 18. Indeed, reliable data on the rate of viral mutation can play a crucial role in evaluating
potential vaccination strategies.
From this sense, we aimed to perform a large scale study over the SARS-CoV-2 genome to
identify the base substitution mutations along with the rate of mutation using the available
dataset in the GISAID. From GISAID, we have analyzed the complete genome sequence of
259044 viral samples isolated from different countries for a certain period of December 2019 to
December 2020. We concentrate particularly on mutations which have freely evolved on
different dates because these are the possible opportunities for further adaptation of SARS-CoV2
to its human host. Afterward, based on the findings from the mutational analysis we intended to

artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). It is
anticipated that the present study will contribute to understand the evolving nature of SARSCoV-2 in the human body and will help to establish strategies to tackle the epidemiological and
evolutionary levels.

2. Results
2.1 Overall mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 genome
Worldwide a total number of 259044 complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 were taken to
investigate the overall genetic variations over the NC_045512.2 Wuhan reference genome and
nd
this analysis identifies a total of 3334545 mutations. Most of the samples possessed more than
an
one mutation where 17221samples were found to contain 18 mutations followed by the 17, 16
and 19 mutations for 17084, 14983, and 14801 samples, respectively. The highest number of 48
mutations were observed for 1 sample (Figure 1). Average mutations per sample was calculated
ed
as 14.01. Among the 259044 complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the top 20 most
ost
mutated samples were identified, and we found that a sample from India had the maximum
m
number of mutations (48). Samples from Scotland, USA, Netherlands, Norway, and France were
re
found to have up to 36 mutations (Figure 2). After the onset of SARS-CoV-2 at Wuhan in
China, 4 mutations were found in December 2019 (Figure S1) and surprisingly from there, the
he
number of mutations reached 25 in January 2020 (Figure S2). We noticed that this number is
increasing exponentially and reached 48 within December 2020. Form the monthly basis of
sequence analysis, we observed that some of the samples from March, August, November, and
nd
December 2020 have 40 mutations whereas 35 mutations were observed in June, July and
nd
October (Figure S1-S13).

and/or SNP trans-version (purine to pyrimidine and pyrimidine to purine) SARS-CoV-2

mutations were classified based on their types. Worldwide the most common transition event

was noticed as C>T transition which accounts for 1756440 (52.67%) of all the observed 3334545

SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The second most common mutation type was marked as G>T trans-version with 486610 occurrences (14.59%) where A>G transition was noticed as third most
ost
common mutation type with 371334 (11.13%) cases. Transition (T>C, and G>A,) and trans-version (G>C, C>G, C>A, and A>T) were remarked as 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 9th, and 10th common

events of SARS-CoV-2 mutational evolution. A particular type of peculiar multi-nucleotide
de
mutation (substitution of a GGG triplet with AAC) was observed as 7th common mutational type

worldwide with 67596 incidents. The deletion of the ATG codon is the most common indel for
SARS-CoV-2 and was found as 16th common mutational type with 1231 events (Figure 4). From

most prominent alteration in every month from January 2020 to December 2020 worldwide

2.5 Prediction of mutation rate of future SARS-CoV-2 variants
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network was used to build the mutation prediction model
el
through the training and testing process of the COVID-19 patient’s sample. Our model can
an
predict the mutation rate of 250 future variants for 98800 training samples at a time. To maintain
in
the model size, we have added the immediately predicted samples at the bottom of the training
ng
samples and deducted the top 250 samples every time. Through this process we predicted the
he
nucleotide mutation rate (%) for 2000 future variants. From this analysis, we observed that the
he
nucleotide mutation rate between the 1st (Figure 7) and 2000th (Figure 8) future variants are
re
highly deviated from each other. We noticed that the substitution of C with T is predominant in
future variants and continuously increasing with the expansion of variants number and increased
ed
about 17% in case of 2000th variant (56%) than 1st (39%), suggesting a possible higher increment
nt
of C>T in future time. On the contrary, replacement of T with C was found to decrease about 7%
%
in 2000th variant (2%) than 1st (9%), propounding a possible decrement of T>C in future time. In
case of G>A and G>T substitutions, we perceived about 6% and 7% decrement respectively in
2000th variant when compared to 1st whereas 7% and 3% increment was respectively observed
ed
for A>G and A>T substitutions. We did not observe any noticeable alterations as T>G\A,
A,
C>G\A and A>T\C from 1st to 2000th future variants (Figure 9).

3. Discussion
Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, it is evolving continuously in human populations over time
and thus driving its massive worldwide spread. Due to the genetic diversity of the virus along
with the patient’s genomic variations, the severity of COVID-19 greatly varies from patient to
patient. A large proportion of patients either remain symptomless or show mild to moderate
symptoms. Nevertheless, some patients who experience severe infection die after hospitalization
20
. This difference in disease severity from one person to another is one of the mysteries events
which is probably associated with the genetic variations of the virus. The genomic sequence data
offers a great opportunities to study the molecular changes in the expanding viral population by
providing new insights into the mode of spread, diversity during the pandemics and the dynamics
of evolutions 21. The current study was intended to explore the genome wide accumulation of
viral mutations at different time points to identify mutations which are occurring globally and to
predict the mutation rate of the virus for future times through the artificial recurrent neural
network (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).
Mutational profiles of the 259044 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from December 2019 to December 2020
recognize a total of 3334545 mutations with an average of 14.01 mutations per sample, confirms
a relative high mutation rate of the virus. Each of the 17221, 17084, 14983, and 14801 samples
were found to contain 18, 17, 16 and 19 mutations, respectively. Whereas 48 mutations were
identified for 1 samples. The occurrence of such high amount of mutations in large number of
samples indicating a faster molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which probably responsible for
making it more deadly in terms of time. Among the mostly mutated 20 samples, Indian sample
had the maximum number of mutations of 48 followed by the samples (having up to 36
mutation) from Scotland, USA, Netherlands, Norway, and France. This high mutation rate could
be the main reason behind the extremely deadly action of this virus in these particular regions
specially USA and India. Alongside, we notice that the number of mutation is exponentially
increased in every months from the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 till December 2020 (48
mutations) which is to suggest the virus holds its mutating nature and continuously evolving in
the similar pattern. Analysis of the nature of SARS-CoV-2 mutations confirms a conserved
molecular mechanism for SARA-CoV-2 mutational evolution as the missense mutations
(52.35%) are the most prevalent mutational events in terms of long time, followed by the silent
SNPs (37.02%) and extragenic SNPs (10.12%). Missense mutations are known to effect the
protein structure, hence alter the stability even protein-protein interactions. Wide occurrence of
missense mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change its proteins shape and stability that
probably makes it more interactive with the host receptor protein 19. In our large scale study,
previously reported D614G, and P314L missense mutations are also identified as the most
prevalent mutation in the viral genome. The D614G mutation in spike protein is responsible for
the initial entry of the virus through the hACE2 receptor and associated with severity of COVID
19. The P314L mutation in NSP12 is associated with the D614G mutation and may favor the
SARS-CoV-2 by enhancing its transmission ability 22. Conversely, the nonsense mutations in the
viral genome may alter the protein’s nature as they might cause complications with exon splicing
enhancers (ESEs) which can change the mRNA processing 23. F106F mutation is found as
predominantly occurring nonsense mutation in NSP3, suggesting a possible role in mRNA

processing which might alter the nature of the viral protein. Moreover, extragenic SNP, specially
SNPs in 5 UTR may affect the folding of the ssRNA and influence the transcription and
replication rates of SARS-CoV-2 24. With this term, the 5 UTR:C241T mutation might be
associated with the transcription and replication rates of SARS-CoV-2 as it is found to occur
most prominently. Along with the previously found GGG>AAC mutation, our mutational type
analysis identify some another multi-nucleotide mutations CC>TT, TG>CA, and AT>TA which
are in the top 20 mutational type and should be monitored for the future as the GGG>AAC
(R203K and G204R) reported to be associated with the insertion of a lysine in SR domain of N
protein which might affect the phosphorylation 25. Besides D416G, F106F, P314L, and 5
UTR:C241T, our large scale analysis also identify C22227T;L93L (membrane protein M),
G29645T;A222V (spike protein S), G21255C;A199A (NSP16), C28932T;V30L (ORF10), and
T445C;A220V (N protein) mutations which are in top 10 mutations found in our investigation
and should get importance in evaluating their role in the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2
transmission. Whatever, since the SARS-CoV-2 continuously evolving, new mutations will
surely emerge. Our Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network based future
mutation prediction model claim that the virus will continue to mutate in a high rate which might
give evolutionary advantage to the virus as mutations occur in the similar fashion. Mutation rate
analysis for future time for 2000 patients predicts a 17% increment of C>T with the expansion of
patients number which suggesting a possible higher increment of C>T in future time.
Furthermore, 7% and 3% increment is respectively observed for A>G and A>T substitutions. At
the same time, decrement is also noticed for T>C (7%), G>A (6%), and G>T (7%) mutations in
future time. The appearance of new mutations may affect the building of new therapies and even
can impair the adaptation of current therapies to get rid of the new molecular structure of the
coronavirus. The appearance of new mutations may increase the viral transmission. For example,
we notice from our monthly sequence analysis that after the emergence of coronavirus in
December 2019, the virus with a large number mutations (up to 30) were identified within 1 year
in India, Scotland, USA, Netherlands, Norway, Israel, Italy, England and France, suggesting the
fastest spread of SARS-CoV-2 subpopulation worldwide. Continuous tracking of mutations is
the key to map the spread of the virus between individuals and throughout the world.

4. Conclusion
The COVID-19 has challenged the globe not just with regard to global health but also
psychological and economic health. This challenge has been taken up in the scientific
community and is investigating the virus and its pathogenicity along with clinical management.
In this present study through integrated strategies of bioinformatics and deep neural learning, we
explained the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 strains as well as the mutation rate of the virus
in future. We also have explained the pattern of the identified mutations which showed a
prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) as a major mutational type worldwide. We
highlighted the viral strains containing highest number of mutations. Most frequently occurring
mutations in protein level was also explained along with multi-nucleotide mutations. Based on
the LSTM-RNN model, we predicted the nucleotide mutation rate for 2000 future variants which
exhibited that the virus will continue to evolve in a similar pattern, suggesting a conserved
molecular evolution of the virus. To the best our knowledge, this study will facilitate the tracking
of mutations and help to map the spread of the virus worldwide. Extensive studies will be
required to explore whether the identified mutations can exert any effect on the COVID-19
severity.

5. Methods
5.1 Genomic data retrieval of SARS-CoV-2
To investigate the genetic variations of SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes, we retrieved 259044
complete genome sequences submitted from 01 December 2019 to 31 December 2020 across all
countries from the Global Influenza Data Sharing Initiative (GISAID) database

26

. The full-

length sequences (>29000bp), as well as high nucleotide coverage (<1% Ns; <0.05% unique
amino acid mutations), were considered for retrieving the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences.
Genomes associated with human infection were taken and the poor coverage (>5 percent Ns)
genomes were excluded from the list. The reference genome sequence (NC_045512.2) of SARSCoV-2 27 containing 29,903bp in length was downloaded in FASTA format from National Center
for Biotechnological Information (NCBI) database.

5.2 Genomic variability analysis of SARS-CoV-2
A GFF3 annotation file associated to the reference was used to show the genomic sequences for
all protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2. The ORF1 polyprotein was divided into its Nonstructural proteins (NSPs) constituent such as NSP12. In the genome annotation, viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase encoding NSP12 was considered as two regions called NSP12a and
NSP12b. Alignment of total 259044 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences was done by using
NUCMER v3.1 algorithm

28

where NC_045512.2 was considered as reference sequence. An R

script was used to convert the output of the alignment to an annotated variant list that contain all
the mutational events in nucleotide and protein level

29

. The annotated variant list was then

loaded through an in-house R script and checked whether there is any IUPAC code other than A,
C, G, and T. If there is a different code, the list is fixed by removing it. Finally, the reference
sequence was loaded along with the GFF3 annotation file of the reference sequence. The
NUCMER object was then categorized according to SNPs, insertions and deletions. All the SNPs
were then merged together in a separate file. Similarly, all the insertions and deletions were
separated. Afterwards, we again merged the NUCMER object according to neighboring events
(SNPs, insertions and deletions). Changes in query protein sequence according to variants were
observed over the GFF3 annotation file of the reference sequence.

5.3 Deep neural learning and future mutation prediction
A dataset having all the nucleotide mutation data from 01 December 2019 to 31 December 2020
was prepared and processed to predict future mutations based on machine learning approach. In
this regard, each sample with single or multiple mutations was separated and labeled. For each
mutation (A>T\C\G, T>A\C\G, C>A\T\G, and G>A\T\C), the mutation rate (%) was calculated
for each sample. Afterwards, the dataset that contained percentage based mutation data was used
to select around 100000 samples randomly to run the model properly within our limited
resources. The selected data were later divided to 80/20% as train and test sets. The train set was
scaled by MinMaxScaler() function, a function of Scikit-learn machine learning library, and a
time series generator was defined for the prediction of future mutations 30.
An artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network
was used to build the mutation prediction model. The model was trained with a
TimeseriessGenerator, a tool of keras API used for automatically transform a univariate or
multivariate time series dataset into a supervised learning problem, and compared against the
Test set. The input layer of the model got the prepared set of training data with 200 neurons.
Then it has been through a dense layer of 200 neurons with relu activation layer. After that 0.15
dropout has been used. A dense of 12 neurons has been used as an output layer. The model was
trained in 100 epochs. Adam optimized and mse (Mean Squared Error) loss function was used to
train the model. Finally, the mutation rate (%) was predicted for the future 2000 SARS-CoV-2
variants.
