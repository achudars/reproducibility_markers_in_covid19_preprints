Abstract
Motivation
The recent emergence of the novel SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its
international spread pose a global health emergency. The viral spike (S) glycoprotein
binds the receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2
entry into host cells. The trimeric S protein binds the receptor using the distal receptorbinding domain (RBD) causing conformational changes in S protein that allow priming by
host cell proteases. Unravelling the dynamic structural features used by SARS-CoV-2 for
entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal novel therapeutic targets.
Using structures determined by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we performed
structural analysis and atomic comparisons of the different conformational states adopted
by the SARS-CoV-2-RBD.
Results
Here, we determined the key structural components induced by the receptor and
characterized their intramolecular interactions. We show that κ-helix (also known as
polyproline II) is a predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the
conversion to the active form of the S protein. We demonstrate a series of conversions
between switch-like κ-helix and β-strand, and conformational variations in a set of short
α-helices which affect the proximal hinge region. This conformational changes lead to an
alternating pattern in conserved disulfide bond configurations positioned at the hinge,
indicating a possible disulfide exchange, an important allosteric switch implicated in viral
entry of various viruses, including HIV and murine coronavirus. The structural information
presented herein enables us to inspect and understand the important dynamic features
of SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a novel potential therapeutic strategy to block viral
entry. Overall, this study provides guidance for the design and optimization of structurebased intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Several members of the coronavirus family circulate in the human population and usually
manifest mild respiratory symptoms (Su, et al., 2016). However, over the past two
decades, emerging coronaviruses (CoV) have raised great public health concerns
worldwide. The highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) (Drosten, et al., 2003; Ksiazek, et al., 2003) and Middle-East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Zaki, et al., 2012) have crossed the species barrier
and cause deadly pneumonia in afflicted individuals, SARS and MERS, respectively.
SARS-CoV first emerged in humans in Guangdong province of China in 2002, and its
global spread was associated with 774 deaths among 8,096 cases (de Wit, et al., 2016;
WHO, 2004). In 2012, MERS-CoV was first identified in the Arabian Peninsula and spread
to 27 countries, infecting a total of 2,494 people and claiming 858 lives (WHO, 2020).
While the SARS pandemic was finally stopped by conventional control measures,
including patient isolation and travel restrictions, new cases of MERS have been reported
(Yoon and Kim, 2019).

In December 2019, a previously unknown CoV, named SARS-CoV-2, was
discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province of China (Huang, et al., 2020; Wang, et al., 2020;
Zhu, et al., 2020). The sudden emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly evolved
into a pandemic that posed a serious threat to global health and economy (Gates, 2020).
Although SARS and MERS have a higher mortality rate, SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID19) spreads much more rapidly (To, et al., 2020). As of May 2020, more than 4,000,000
confirmed infections were reported in 216 countries, including over 300,000 deaths
(WHO, 2020). MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 were suggested to originate
from bats and most likely serve as a reservoir host for these viruses (Ge, et al., 2013;
Haagmans, et al., 2014; Li, et al., 2005; Memish, et al., 2013; Zhou, et al., 2020). Detailed
investigations of the zoonotic origin of human CoVs indicate that SARS-CoV was
transmitted from palm civets to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to
humans (Guan, et al., 2003; Haagmans, et al., 2014; Kan, et al., 2005). However, the
intermediate host for zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, linked to a wet animal market
in Wuhan, is still under investigation (Walls, et al., 2020; Ye, et al., 2020).

The spike (S) glycoprotein is a class I fusion protein that mediates the entry of
CoVs into target cells (Tortorici, et al., 2019). The S protein forms homotrimers that
protrude from the viral surface (Figure 1A) and comprises two functional subunits, which
facilitate viral attachment to the surface of host cells (S1 subunit) and fusion of the viral
and cellular membranes (S2 subunit) (Figure 1B). The distal part of S1 subunit, the
receptor-binding domain (RBD), is linked through two anti-parallel hinge linkers which
connect the domain to the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain 2 (CTD2) and
allow the transition between closed and open conformations (Gui, et al., 2017; Song, et
al., 2018; Walls, et al., 2020; Yuan, et al., 2017) (Figure 1A-C). The open conformation of
the S1 subunit facilitates interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
(Figure 1D-E), which contributes to the stabilization of the prefusion state of the S2
subunit that contains the fusion machinery (Song, et al., 2018; Walls, et al., 2020).
Activated S protein is cleaved by host proteases at the S1/S2 and S2’ site resulting in a
cleaved S2’ subunit that drives the fusion of viral and cellular membranes (Belouzard, et
al., 2009; Millet and Whittaker, 2014; Pallesen, et al., 2017). The critical step in SARSCoV-2 infection which involves the transition between a metastable prefusion state to a
stable post-fusion state is triggered by binding to ACE2 which induces conformational
changes in the RBD and the hinge region (Gui, et al., 2017; Pallesen, et al., 2017; Song,
et al., 2018; Walls, et al., 2020). While the interaction between the S protein and ACE2
has been extensively studied (Han, et al., 2006; Lan, et al., 2020; Letko, et al., 2020; Li,
2013; Shang, et al., 2020; Song, et al., 2018; Wan, et al., 2020; Wang, et al., 2020; Yan,
et al., 2020), the key determinants in the activation of the virus upon binding to the host
receptor is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the structural basis of the SARSCoV-2 S protein modulation induced by virus-receptor interaction.

Methods
Structure collection and modeling
We searched the PDB database for high-quality structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein
at closed, open, and bound conformations. For each conformation, we used the structure
with the lowest resolution that contains the RBD and the hinge region. For the unboundclosed, unbound-open, and bound conformations, we used PDB IDs 6VXX:B, 6VYB:B,
and 6M0J:E, respectively. To model the position of SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to
ACE2, we structurally aligned the models to the RBD of ACE-BoAT1 complex (Yan, et al.,
2020) (6M17) and SARS-CoV in the bound conformation with the highest degree of RBD
opening (Song, et al., 2018) (6ACK). The structures were preprocessed with Dock Prep
and aligned using UCSF Chimera v1.13 (Pettersen, et al., 2004). To compare the
secondary structure compositions of attachment proteins, we used structures with the
lowest resolution from different families of enveloped viruses with class I fusion proteins
(White, et al., 2008). These structures were compared to a random dataset comprising
the first 1000 non-viral PDB proteins deposited in 2020 with a resolution <3 Å.

Secondary structure assignment
The initial assignment of secondary structure was performed using DSSP (Touw, et al.,
2015). To assign κ-helix (alternative designation for polyproline II [PPII]), we used the
method which was recently introduced (Meirson, et al., 2020; Meirson, et al., 2020).
Briefly, we calculated the root-mean-square dihedral deviations (RMSdD) of the peptide
backbone torsional angles φ and ψ as a measure of the average deviation from a
reference κ-helix. To include short segments of κ-helix, at least two consecutive residues
with mean RMSdD below the cutoff (ε) of 17 (Mansiaux, et al., 2011) were defined as the
criteria for the assignment.

Structural characterization
To analyze the conformational changes induced by ACE2 binding, we compared the
bound with the unbound form. We included both the open and closed states of the
unbound structures to highlight the specific effects induced by the interaction with ACE2.
The backbone dihedral angles (φ, ψ) were converted to generic helix parameters ϑ

(angular step per residue) and d (rise per reside) as described by Miyazawa (Miyazawa,
1961) to describe the geometrical variations intuitively. Van der Waals (VDW)
intramolecular interactions were determined using a distance cutoff of 3.5 Å. Only
interactions that were gained or lost by the bound compared to both unbound
conformations were considered. To identify interacting residues with considerable shifts,
displacements smaller than 0.5 Å were excluded. To identify important backbone
hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), the mean difference in the electrostatic interaction energy
between the bound and the unbound conformations was calculated using DSSP. For
each acceptor-donor pair, gain, or loss of H-bond was defined if the mean energy
difference is <-1kcal/mol or >1kcal/mol, respectively. The magnitude of the energy
threshold represents twice the standard cutoff (-0.5kcal/mol) for the existence of a H-bond
(Zhang and Sagui, 2015). Structural analyses was performed with the Bio3D package
(Grant, et al., 2006) in R version 3.6.

Disulfide bond analysis
Due to inconsistencies in the reported composition of disulfide bonds in the RBD in
different structures (Lavillette, et al., 2006; Song, et al., 2018; Walls, et al., 2020; Wrapp,
et al., 2020; Yuan, et al., 2017) and to account for possible errors in modeling disulfide
bonds (Carpentier, et al., 2010; Kleywegt and Jones, 1995; Villa and Lasker, 2014;
Wlodawer, et al., 2008), we used Disulfide by Design 2.0 (DbD2) to calculate χ3 torsion
angles and bond energies (Craig and Dombkowski, 2013). The DbD2 algorithm could
accurately predict the chiralities and positions of disulfide bonds based on energy
function, reflecting the geometric characteristics of disulfide bonds among high-quality
crystal structures (Craig and Dombkowski, 2013; Wiedemann, et al., 2020). We used the
estimated disulfide energy threshold of <2.17kcal/mol that applies to most naturally
occurring disulfides, χ3 angles of -87 or 97 ± 20 (Craig and Dombkowski, 2013) and
disulfide bond distance of 2.03 ± 5% (Spek, 1990) to indicate a high probability of a
disulfide bond that satisfies stereochemical constraints.

Graphical visualization
The models were visualized using UCSF ChimeraX v0.94 (Goddard, et al., 2018). Models
with reassigned secondary structures were visualized using the academic version of
Schrodinger Maestro v11.1 (Bell, et al., 2006). κ-helices and 310-helices were represented
as ribbons and tubes, respectively. Ribbons were drawn, passing through carbon alphas.
Trajectories were produced by interpolating between the bound and unbound-closed
conformation and visualized using VMD (Humphrey, et al., 1996).

Results
Secondary structure determination
To characterize the structural composition of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and other
members of the class I fusion proteins, we calculated the distribution of secondary
structure assignment. Since κ-helix (PPII) often serves functional purposes in proteins
(Adzhubei, et al., 2013; Meirson, et al., 2020) and DSSP does not assign the
conformation, we performed reassignment of the secondary structures to reveal potential
κ-helix conformations. Compared to a random dataset in the PDB, structures of the
attachment proteins of CoVs, influenza, measles, HIV and Ebola viruses display higher
proportions of β-strands and κ-helices, whereas α-helix is under-represented (Figure 2A).
Among non-regular secondary structures, the random coil is the most over-represented
assignment. The reassigned SARS-CoV-2 structure reveals a diverse distribution of κhelices throughout the domain, whereas other secondary structures are clustered more
closely together (Figure 2B-C). The most common secondary structure in the ACE2
binding interface is κ-helix (Figure 2C).

Structural variations of SARS-CoV-2-RBD bound with ACE2 receptor
To gain insights into the effects of ACE2 interaction on the S protein of SARS-COV-2, we
analyzed the intramolecular structural variations in the bound versus the unbound-closed
and unbound-open conformations. Figure 3 depicts a summary of the main differences
in the intramolecular interaction and H-bond profile upon receptor binding and allows to
follow the interconnectivity path leading to the hinge region at the termini. While small
changes in the rotational angles or rise of residues occur throughout the domain (Figure

3A), the most substantial changes happen at non-regular secondary structures such as
coils and turns. Compared with the unbound-open state, the bound conformation is
mainly associated with the formation of κ-helices (20 residues), followed by α-helices (13
residues), β-strands (10 residues), and a 310-helix (3 residues). The interaction map
demonstrates a rich rearrangement of intramolecular interactions (Figure 3A).
Interactions are gained mostly in missing loops at the binding interface (455-491),
whereas lost interactions are scattered throughout the domain. Figure 3B shows the
redistribution of main-chain H-bonds energy and rearrangement of acceptor and donor
H-bond networks. Consistent with the interconnectivity map, the pairing of H-bonds
occurs at the ACE2 binding interface. Interestingly, local rearrangements of H-bonds
occur mainly at α-helices, whereas κ-helices facilitate distant H-bonds. This indicates that
κ-helices mediate switch-like interactions.

A closer inspection into the structural variations induced by the interaction SARSCoV-2-RBD and ACE2 is shown in Figure 4. Upon binding, three H-bond networks
comprising residues V504, Y505 with Q506, D442, Y495 with F497, and D442, N448 with
K444, are destabilized (Figure 4A). The loss of H-bonds of Y495 and the side chains of
K443 and Y505 is associated with conversion between κ5’ into a coil and the formation
of a new κ-helix κ10. This results in the advancement of D442 and the stabilization of αhelix α5. The amino-acid R509 is rotated and switches between a β-strand (β7) to a κhelix (κ12) while gaining a solid network of H-bonds and salt bridge with the side chain of
D442 in the newly formed α5, at the expense of losing H-bonds with the backbone of
V341 and F342 (Figure 4B). Consequently, a new H-bond is formed between N343 and
G339, which converts 3101’ into α1. The adoption of a shorter-pitched α-helix pulls κ1,
which constructs the N-terminus of the hinge region. The main-chain H-bond of F515 with
G314 and the π-π interaction with F392 are lost (Figure 4C) while a stronger pairing of
H-bond forms between G431 and Y380 (Figure 3B). The rearrangement of the
interactions is associated with conformational changes, including the conversion between
κ14’ to β8, which constructs the C-terminus of the hinge region. Also, the loop
downstream to Y380 is displaced, and α-helix α3 is formed by a contribution of H-bond
between the backbones of P384 and N388. The H-bond between L397 and 390 is lost,
and the new α3 packs closely together with α2, which includes VDW interactions between
S366 and T385 (Figure 4D). Notably, this interaction is among the only gained contacts
observed in the RBD, not involving the missing loops (Figure 3A). Also, a concentration

of H-bonds is re-distributed along α2, repositioning the α-helix one step back (from 366370 to 365-369). This transition is associated with a small movement of β1 at the medial
region of the hinge.

Dissociation between the RBD and CTD2
The κ13/κ14 loop between residues 515 and 523 exhibits a relatively large conformational
change between the unbound-closed and the bound states (Supplementary Figure 1).

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.113175; this version posted May 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

This loop is involved in the interaction between the RBD and CTD2 in the closed
conformation. However, in the open conformation where RBD dissociates from CTD2,
the loop is missing in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Song, et al., 2018; Walls, et al.,
2020; Wrapp, et al., 2020). The dissociation between the domains is required for the
hinge and the RBD to move freely. Together, this indicates that the RBD-ACE2 complex
stabilizes the κ13/κ14 loop in a conformation that disfavors the interaction between RBD
and CTD2.

Disulfide bond analysis
The RBD-ACE2 complex inducible interactions culminate in the hinge region. The hinge,
which we show to exhibit various conformational changes (Figure 3 and 4), contains two
pairs of cysteines. Since cysteine pairs have the potential to act as allosteric switches
(Bekendam, et al., 2016; Butera, et al., 2018; Chiu and Hogg, 2019), we hypothesized
they are altered during the interaction between the S protein and ACE2 receptor.
Therefore, we calculated the energy and geometrical features of the potential disulfide
bonds in all high-quality structures of the RBD in SARS-CoV-2. Due to gross
inconsistencies between disulfide assignments (Lavillette, et al., 2006; Song, et al., 2018;
Walls, et al., 2020; Wrapp, et al., 2020; Yuan, et al., 2017) and quality issues of these
pairs, we also characterized quality metrics of the cysteine pairs. Figure 5A shows an
alternating pattern in the quality metrics of the N- (Cys336-Cys361) and C-terminal (Cys391Cys525) cysteine pairs, except one structure (PDB 6VYB:B) in which the pair Cys336-Cys361
in the open conformation is in the reduced form. This indicates that only one disulfide
exists at a given state. Among cysteine pairs without assignment issues, the disulfide
bond energy also shows an alternating pattern (Figure 5B), where the unbound-open and
bound conformation have low energies in the N- and C-terminal cysteine pairs,
respectively. This indicates that the cysteine pair switch between disulfide classes upon
binding of the RBD to the receptor. Since the two cysteine pairs are aligned parallelly and
closely together, the results suggest they are involved in disulfide shuffling (Figure 5B,C).

Discussion
The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a major epidemiological
challenge. ACE2 has been reported to be the receptor that initiates the activation of this
novel CoV (Hoffmann, et al., 2020; Yan, et al., 2020). In this study, we determined the
key structural components induced by the receptor and characterized their intramolecular
interactions.

Numerous structures of the prefusion human CoV S proteins were determined at
different states, and the key regions responsible for the interaction with the receptor were
previously reported (Lan, et al., 2020; Shang, et al., 2020; Walls, et al., 2020; Wan, et al.,
2020; Wrapp, et al., 2020; Yan, et al., 2020). However, to our knowledge, no previous
study has extensively investigated the mechanism of transduction through the RBD. The
structural transduction mechanism on a molecular level remains a difficult question to
address experimentally. Therefore, we used current state-of-the-art structures of the
SARS-CoV-2-RBD and focused on their structural organization. These structures
represent snapshots of the dynamic S protein and allow to track and model the
conformational transitions between the different states.

Characterizing the secondary structures of proteins is fundamental for gaining
knowledge and simplifying the complicated 3D structures. We show that κ-helix is a
predominant structure in the binding interface and in facilitating the conversion to the
active form of the S protein. This conformation which is commonly known as PPII was
recently designated as κ-helix, following the widespread criticism of the misleading
name PPII (Adzhubei, et al., 2013; Hollingsworth, et al., 2009; Mansiaux, et al., 2011;
Martin, et al., 2014; Meirson, et al., 2020; Meirson, et al., 2020). As many structures
contain few prolines or none, the name ‘polyproline’ is considered inappropriate, and a
more general term which abides the tradition of Latin letters to secondary structures
was proposed (Meirson, et al., 2020). The role of κ-helix in propagating interactions and
facilitating switch-like components coincides with the assessment that they represent
‘functional blocks’ as compared with other conformations such as α-helices that often
represent structural building blocks (Adzhubei, et al., 2013; Meirson, et al., 2020). The

flexible and extended conformation of κ-helices, as well as non-regular H-bonds and
preferred location on the surface of proteins, making them ideal elements for a wide
range of molecular interactions (Cubellis, et al., 2005; Stapley and Creamer, 1999;
Zagrovic, et al., 2005). However, despite being more common than most secondary
structures, this conformation is often overlooked, apart from proline-rich regions. This is
explained in part because it is not defined by H-bonds and is not assigned by the
secondary structure assignment program employed in the PDB. Other reasons include
a lack of graphical representation and its misleading historical name (Meirson, et al.,
2020).
Our findings demonstrate that the high prevalence of κ-helix, as well as β-strands, are
not unique to SARS-CoV-2 and appear to characterize other viruses. The conformational
changes between different states of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD are associated with a typical
transition between β-strand and κ-helix, as they are closely related in the torsional space
(Hollingsworth and Karplus, 2010; Mansiaux, et al., 2011; Oh, et al., 2010). Therefore, we
hypothesize that κ-helix could serve as an efficient evolutionary tool due to its flexible
nature, which could adapt more quickly in the dynamic environment compared to more
restricted secondary structures. In line with this suggestion, Austin et al. showed
evolutionary conservation of κ-helix bias in intrinsically disordered regions that could be
tuned by changing the distribution of κ-helix for multiple functions, including molecular
recognition or allosteric regulation (Austin Elam, et al., 2013).

The hinge region was reported to facilitate the RBD motion and participate in the
activation process (Gui, et al., 2017; Pallesen, et al., 2017; Song, et al., 2018; Walls, et
al., 2020), and our structural analysis suggests that the conformational changes culminate
at the hinge which contains four highly conserved cysteines (Shang, et al., 2020; Wang,
et al., 2020). To explore a possible allosteric switching mechanism, we performed atomic
comparisons of the cysteine pairs at different states of the S protein. Since
inconsistencies in disulfide assignment exist and errors in structure determination are not
uncommon (Carpentier, et al., 2010; Kleywegt and Jones, 1995; Villa and Lasker, 2014;
Wlodawer, et al., 2008), we also assessed their geometric quality. Atomic details of the

structures at a pH range of 6.5-8.0 reveal alternating patterns in bond energy, geometric
characteristics, and quality, between the pairs Cys336-Cys361 and Cys391-Cys525, but not
in Cys379-432. Nonetheless, Cys379-432 displays a switch in the chirality of the disulfide bond
in the bound state. These findings demonstrate a switching mechanism between disulfide
bonds of Cys336-Cys361 and Cys391-Cys525, where at each state (open, closed, or bound),
only one pair of cysteine satisfies favorable disulfide configuration and quality criteria. The
unfavorable configuration is associated with unphysical disulfide bond characteristics,
high energy, poor quality, or their combination. This indicates that the distorted disulfide
bonds entail substantial stress or that bond assignments were inaccurate, and these pairs
are reduced. Both are possible as the cysteine pairs, located at the hinge, undergo
significant conformational changes, and forced stretching of disulfide bonds is known to
accelerate their cleavage (Zhou, et al., 2014). The four cysteine residues are adjacent
and aligned suitably for disulfide exchange reactions. Such an arrangement makes it
possible for a concerted series of disulfide exchange reactions to occur (Zhou, et al.,
2008) and is supported by the alternating pattern of the Cys336-Cys361 and Cys391-Cys525
disulfide bond configurations. A proposed model of disulfide shuffling and SARS-CoV-2
viral entry is depicted in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Proposed model for the pre- to post-fusion transition of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The closed and
open transitions are associated with the dissociation of RBD and CTD2 and conformational changes in
the hinge region, including disulfide bond rearrangement. The complex of SARS-CoV-2-RBD with ACE2
induces conformational changes and rearrangement of the disulfide bonds that stabilize the S protein in
the active form. The Activated S protein is cleaved by host proteases and induces the pre- to post-fusion
transition of the S2 subunit, and initiates the fusion of viral and cellular membranes.

Beyond serving purely structural role, disulfide bonds can participate in redox
reactions and act as allosteric switches controlling protein functions (Bekendam, et al.,
2016; Butera, et al., 2018; Chiu and Hogg, 2019; Zhou, et al., 2014). Specific disulfide
exchange reactions depend on a reducing agent such as thioredoxin or protein disulfide
isomerase (PDI) (Zhou, et al., 2014). Rearrangement of disulfides (disulfide shuffling) can

also occur via intra-protein thiol-disulfide exchange reactions without additional agents,
which depends on conformational changes (Chiu and Hogg, 2019; Zhang, et al., 2018).
An increasing number of studies support an essential role for disulfide exchange in the
entry of multiple viruses in susceptible cells (Stantchev, et al., 2012). In HIV, the
attachment of gp120 subunit of the viral envelope (Env) to its primary receptor CD4,
induces conformational changes that cause disulfide exchange in a PDI-dependent
manner and is obligatory for triggering membrane-fusion process (Fenouillet, et al., 2007;
Owen, et al., 2016; Stantchev, et al., 2012). More specifically, structural rearrangements
of the S protein of CoV murine hepatitis virus (MHV) during cell interaction has been
reported to affect cell entry using disulfide shuffling in the RBD (Gallagher, 1996;
Weismiller, et al., 1990) as our result suggest for SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, Lavillette et
al. showed that SARS-CoV S1 subunit is redox insensitive using chemical manipulation
of the redox state, in contrast to various viruses including HIV and the CoV MHV
(Fenouillet, et al., 2007; Lavillette, et al., 2006). However, the study utilized murine
leukemia retrovirus (MLV) pseudotyped with S1 subunit, lacking the S2 subunit, a system
with limited biological relevance as the subunits cooperate and form a tightly packed
trimeric structure. Furthermore, the subunits remain non-covalently bound after
proteolytic S1/S2 cleavage (Tortorici, et al., 2019; Walls, et al., 2016).

We propose that targeted redox exchange between conserved cysteine pairs in
the S protein could conceptualize a new strategy in the development of high-affinity
ligands against SARS-CoV-2, with important therapeutic implications. Recently, Hati et
al. showed, using molecular dynamic simulations, that reducing all disulfide bonds in both
ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 impairs their binding affinity (Bhattacharyay and Hati, 2020).
However, more evidence is required to establish the role of redox potential and paired
and unpaired cysteines in the S protein during viral entry. Also, our study is limited to a
computational assessment of structures reconstructed using X-ray and cryoEM, and the
implications of the observed structural rearrangements remain to be determined.

Currently, no efficient antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 or other CoVs are available, and
numerous clinical trials are underway (Lythgoe and Middleton, 2020). In parallel, efforts

continue to develop antivirals and vaccines (Chen, et al., 2020; Liu, et al., 2020).
Structure-based design of antivirals that efficiently recognize the target relies on
understanding the main structural features, including local structural dynamics.
Furthermore, developing selective therapies and efficient vaccines against adaptive
evolutionary patterns of the virus poses a significant challenge. This challenge is amplified
due to the persistency of the pandemic and the estimation that SARS-CoV-2 might
continue to circulate in the population with renewed outbreaks (Kissler, et al., 2020; Tse,
et al., 2020; Ye, et al., 2020). Our analysis has laid the major inducible structural features
of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD and propose a new potential therapeutic strategy to block viral
entry. Overall, this study may be helpful in guiding the development and optimization of
structure-based intervention strategies that target SARS-CoV-2.
