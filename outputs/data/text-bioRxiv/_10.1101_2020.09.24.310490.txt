ABSTRACT
Niclosamide (NIC) has demonstrated promising in vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2,
the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though NIC is already FDA-approved, the oral
formulation produces systemic drug levels that are too low to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. As an
alternative, direct delivery of NIC to the respiratory tract as an aerosol could target the primary
site of for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. We have developed a niclosamide powder
suitable for delivery via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray through the incorporation
of human lysozyme (hLYS) as a carrier molecule. This novel formulation exhibits potent in vitro
and in vivo activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and may protect against methicillinresistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring
secondary to CoV infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and
low-cost development approach will ensure wide-spread utilization
MAIN
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic by the World
Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020(1). A rapid and continuing rise in cases worldwide
followed this declaration which has overwhelmed healthcare systems(2, 3). At present, there are
no widely available vaccines or treatments for coronaviruses (4, 5), and outbreaks are expected
to continue potentially into 2025 (6). To address the ongoing pandemic, it is necessary that
treatments are made rapidly available and at low-cost to patients and clinicians worldwide. One
mechanism for achieving this has been to assess existing drugs for their utility against SARSCoV-2. Recently, a screening of 48 FDA-approved drugs revealed that a compound called
niclosamide (NIC), which has been historically utilized to treat intestinal tapeworms, also
exhibits highly potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a Vero cell infection model(7). NIC has
been previously demonstrated to enhance autophagy in Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections through inhibition of SKP2(8), and it is hypothesized that a
similar mechanism of action may enable its anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity(7). The broad-spectrum
pharmaceutical utility of NIC appears to be related to its protonophoric activity, which results in
disruptions of membrane pH gradients that may cause alterations in several signaling pathways.
(9-18) The drug’s non-specific mechanism of action is illustrated by its efficacy against both
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (19-21),

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22-24), Acinetobacter baumannii (22, 25), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (26, 27), and various bacterial biofilms (20, 21, 28), which may enable protection
against secondary bacterial pneumonias associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, NIC has
been noted to inhibit inflammatory cytokine release in lung tissues in vivo(29), which may
provide an important protective effect against cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), one of the most feared sequela of COVID-19.
In terms of pharmaceutical development, a major limitation of NIC as an antiviral therapy stems
from its poor solubility in water, which is reported at 1.6 mg/L(30). This makes systemic
absorption of the drug by the oral route of administration at therapeutically relevant
concentrations difficult. Administration of the existing FDA-approved chewable tablet formulation
was found to result in inadequate systemic concentrations for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
replication.(31, 32) As an alternative, direct delivery of niclosamide to the lung could overcome
the limitations of the oral NIC formulation by generating high drug concentrations at the site of
infection. For use against P. aeruginosa, Costabile et al previously developed an inhalable dry
powder consisting of NIC nanocrystals embedded in mannitol particles.(33) However, these
particles required a high amount of polysorbate 80 to ensure production of a stable suspension
(10% w/w to NIC) which is beyond what is in currently FDA approved inhaled products (34).
Furthermore, the utilization of mannitol as the carrier system may induce bronchospasm and
cough(35-37) which may contribute to increased risk of spread of SARS-CoV-2 through
generation of aerosolized respiratory droplets from infected individuals.
An additional considerable challenge in developing therapies for COVID-19 is the variable
presentation of illness. Patients may act as asymptomatic carriers of the virus or develop severe
pneumonias and acute respiratory disease(38), which can result in the requirement for
mechanical ventilation. In the case of ventilated patients, a nebulizer is often used to delivery
aerosolized drug to the lungs. However, for treatment of asymptomatic carriers or in regions of
developing economies with reduced access to clean water sources, nebulizer-based aqueous
products may present an undue burden and reduce therapy compliance. For these populations,
dry powder inhaler (DPI) or nasal spray systems, or a combination of both, would be the
preferred option based upon the rapid administration time and ease of use and could also
potentially be utilized as a prophylactic therapy in high risk populations such as healthcare
workers and first responders.
Utilizing repurposed NIC, and with the goal of developing a therapeutically effective, rapidly
scalable and globally distributable antiviral therapy to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we
describe an inhalable NIC formulation that can be administered using three major models or
respiratory tract delivery systems: DPI, nasal spray and nebulizer. To achieve these aims, we
utilized human lysozyme (hLYS), an endogenous protein in the upper and lower respiratory
tracts, as a therapeutically active matrix material for the delivery of NIC to the airways, based
upon its known anti-inflammatory (39), antiviral (40-43), and anti-bacterial activity (44-46) as
well as its surface active properties. The antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory efficacy of
the NIC-hLYS powders were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
infection mouse models. The composition of the NIC-hLYS formulation was optimized using a
constrained mixtures Design of Experiments (DoE) achieve particles with a size appropriate for
inhalation both in the dry powder state and when reconstituted in aqueous media.
Physicochemical characterization of the optimized powder was performed and nasal, DPI, and
nebulizer systems were developed and tested.

The addition of human lysozyme enhances in vitro niclosamide potency against
coronaviruses
To determine the utility of hLYS as a carrier molecule for the nasal and pulmonary delivery of
NIC, we assessed the in vitro antiviral activity of our novel formulation against a lysozyme-free
NIC suspension (NIC-M). NIC-hLYS particles (0.7% w/w NIC) were administered at varying
doses (based upon NIC content) to Vero E6 cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, and
the EC50 was calculated based upon observed cytopathic effect (CPE). The addition of hLYS to
the NIC formulation resulted in improved antiviral activity based upon reductions in the EC50
dose for MERS-CoV (0.016 µg/mL NIC to 0.0625 µg/mL NIC) and SARS-CoV-2 (0.030 µg/mL to
0.008 µg/mL) (Fig 1A and 1B).
We assessed the antiviral dose-response of NIC-hLYS particles in separate assay utilizing
qPCR quantification of viral RNA collected from infected cells. At the highest dose tested (0.125
µg/mL NIC), Vero cells with an established MERS-CoV infection exhibited an 82.2% ± 0.8%
decrease in viral load compared to untreated controls after 24-hours of exposure to NIC-hLYS
particles (Fig 1D). This effect was sustained at 48 hours post-drug exposure (92.7% ± 2.0%;
mean ± SD). A similar dose-response profile was achieved in Vero cells with an established
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig 1E). A dose 0.125 µg/mL NIC resulted in a 24-hour inhibition of
92.7% ± 0.5% relative to untreated controls. However, in contrast to the MERS-CoV response,
inhibition dropped to 67.5% ± 2.3% at 48 hours post-exposure in the SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells. A separately conducted trypan blue viability assay in uninfected Vero E6 cells determined
that the highest dose of NIC-hLYS utilized (0.125 µg/mL) had no effect on cell viability versus
untreated controls (98.3% viability in treated cells).
Interestingly, hLYS alone appeared to exhibit activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 1F), which has
not been previously reported. Though the inhibitory activity was not as potent as that of NIC, it
may contribute to observed increase in potency of NIC-hLYS in the CPE-based EC50 assay.
NIC-hLYS, NIC-M and NIC dissolved in DMSO (NIC-DMSO) were compared for their inhibitory
activity against SARS-CoV-2 at a NIC dose of 0.125 µg/mL. A two-way ANOVA with Tukey
multiple comparisons test revealed statistically significant increase in viral inhibition of the NIChLYS particles versus NIC-DMSO at 24 hours (p < 0.0001) and 48 hours (p = 0.0001), though
no significant differences were noted in the viral inhibition of NIC-hLYS and NIC-M formulations
at the tested dose (Fig 1C), Thus, an improvement in solubility does not appear to be the
mechanism for the increased activity of NIC-hLYS.

Figure 1: NIC-hLYS exhibited enhanced antiviral potency compared to NIC particles alone (NICM) in both MERS-CoV (A) and SARS-CoV-2 (B) infected cells. NIC-hLYS particles exhibited
significantly higher inhibition of viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells compared to
an equivalent dose of solubilized NIC (NIC-DMSO), which indicates that improvements in
solubility alone may not be sufficient to achieve maximal antiviral efficacy (C). Similar dose
response profiles were noted for NIC-hLYS in both MERS-CoV (D) and SARS-CoV-2 (E), where
an initial drop in activity is preceded by a sharp rise in activity. This profile was also noted in
inhibitory assays for S. aureus. hLYS alone exhibits some antiviral activity which was more
pronounced at 48 hours post dosing than 24 hours (F). Data presented as mean + SEM (n = 3).

Intranasal administration of NIC-hLYS particles to CoV-infected mice improves
survivability and reduces viral loads in lungs, brain and kidneys
The in vivo efficacy of NIC-hLYS particles was assessed in lethal infection models for both
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. HDDP4 transgenic mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 ×
105 pfu MERS-CoV and rested for 24 hours, after which once daily treatment with varying doses
of intranasal NIC-hLYS (dosed based NIC component) was initiated (Fig 2A). In this initial
efficacy study, animals were sacrificed at Day 6 to determine viral titres in brain and lung tissue
compared to untreated controls. Notable decreases in brain viral titres was observed at the 120
µg/kg dose although these differences were not statistically significant (Two-way ANOVA with
Dunnet’s multiple comparisons test, p = 0.1724) (Fig 2C) . In a follow-up survival study utilizing
lethal inoculum (1 × 105 pfu), MERS-CoV-infected hDDP4 mice were dosed at 240 µg/kg NIChLYS daily by the intranasal route. By Day 10 (study endpoint), 43% of treated mice had
survived compared to 0% of untreated controls (Fig 2B). Surviving mice were left untreated for
an additional 3 days, at which point they were sacrificed. During this period of no treatment, the
survival percentage remained at 43%. A statistically significant decrease in lung viral titres was
noted in these surviving mice compared to the day 6 untreated controls from the earlier efficacy
study (Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test, p = 0.011,). While brain viral
titres did not exhibit further reduction from levels noted in the preliminary efficacy study, the

inoculation of Vero E6 cells with viral particles obtained from lung and brain homogenates of
surviving animals resulted in no observation of CPE at any of the inoculum concentrations
tested, which indicates that remaining viral particles were not active. Thus, in the 43% of
surviving animals it appears that the lethal MERS-CoV infection was essentially cured.
Serological assays revealed that surviving animals expressed anti-MERS CoV IgG antibodies.
Though notable in a lethal infection model, survival probability differences in treated and
untreated mice were not statistically significant (Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.2984).
In a similar study, the efficacy of NIC-hLYS particles was assessed in hACE2 transgenic mice
infected intranasally with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 (1 × 104 pfu) (Fig. 3A). After a 24-hour
rest period, daily intranasal treatment with 0.9% sodium chloride (untreated control) or NIChLYS (240 µg/kg NIC) was initiated. A portion of mice from each group (n = 3) were sacrificed at
day 6 p.i. to determine viral loads in brain, kidney and lung tissues, while remaining animals
were utilized in a 10-day survival study. Non-significant changes in day 6 viral titers were
observed (Two-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple comparisons test) (Fig. 3C). By the day 10
study endpoint, 30% of treated mice had survived, compared to 0% in the untreated arm (Fig
3B). Similar to the MERS-CoV study, these surviving mice were left untreated for an additional 3
days, at which point they were sacrificed (day 14 p.i.). The surviving mice exhibited a
statistically significant decrease in viral loads in lung tissue compared to day 6 p.i. untreated
controls (Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test), p = 0.023,), and no virus
particles were detected in brain and kidney tissue using qPCR (Fig. 3C). Inoculation of Vero E6
cells with 10-fold dilutions of tissue homogenates resulted in no observed CPE, and surviving
animals were sera positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Similar to the MERS-CoV model,
differences in survival probability between treated and untreated were not significant (MantelCox test, p = 0.2959).
In both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection models, the lung tissue of infected and NIChLYS-treated mice (Fig. 2F and 3F) showed lower levels of interstitial pneumonia than that of
infected and non-treated mice (Fig. 2E and 3E) on day 6 p.i.. Inflammation was further reduced
in the treated/infected groups on Day 14 p.i. (Fig. 2F and 3F) and was more comparable to the
mock-infected mice (Fig. 2D and 3D), which showed no signs of interstitial pneumonia.

Figure 2: The efficacy of NIC-hLYS particles was assessed in a lethal MERS-CoV infection
model (A). Once daily intranasal administration of NIC-hLYS particles suspended in 0.45% NaCl
resulted in 43% survival in a lethal MERS-CoV infection (B) and produced a statistically
significant decrease in lung viral titers at the highest dose tested (C). The viral particles obtained
from lung and brain homogenates of surviving animals did not produce CPE when administered
to Vero E6 cells, indicated that they were no longer active. Compared to lung tissue of
uninfected mice (D), hDPP4-TG mice infected with MERS-CoV exhibited severe interstital
pneumonia on Day 6 of infection (E), mice treated with NIC-hLYS exhibited milder iterstitial
pneumona by Day 6 of treatment (F), which was further reduced by Day 14 (G). Data are
presented as mean + SEM (n = 3). *p < 0.05, using two-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple

model (A). Once daily intranasal administration of NIC-hLYS particles suspended in 0.45% NaCl
resulted in 30% survival in a lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection (B) and produced a statistically
significant decrease in lung viral titers after 10 days of dosing (C). The viral particles obtained
from lung and brain homogenates of surviving animals did not produce CPE when administered
to Vero E6 cells, indicated that they were no longer active. Compared to lung tissue of
uninfected mice (D), infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the development of interstitial
pneumonia without treatment (E). By Day 6 of treatment with 240 µg/kg NIC, interstitial
pneumonia was notably reduced (F) and further resolved by Day 14 (F). Data are presented as

Niclosamide-lysozyme particles protect against two COVID-19 sequalae: secondary
bacterial infection and inflammatory response
COVID-19 patients may be at-risk for secondary bacterial pneumonias and severe inflammatory
lung damage. The efficacy of NIC-hLYS in the treatment of these important COVID-19 sequalae

was therefore assessed. A resazurin-based microbroth dilution assay was performed to
determine the inhibitory activity of several NIC formulations (NIC-hLYS, NIC-BSA, NIC-M, and
NIC-DMSO). Compared to the other NIC formulations, NIC-hLYS reached an MIC50 at lower
levels of NIC (0.0625 µg/mL), and 100% inhibition was noted at a concentration of 0.125 µg/mL
(Fig 4A-C). No inhibitory activity was observed for hLYS alone. Interestingly, all NIC
formulations exhibited a similar dose-response profile where a sharp dip in activity preceded the
concentrations at which 100% inhibition was achieved. This same pattern was also noted in the
dose-response profiles for anti-MERS-CoV and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (Fig 1D and E).
Plating of the wells with 100% inhibition noted resulted in the growth of colonies at all drug
concentrations tested, which indicates that the antimicrobial activity of NIC may be bacteriostatic
rather than bactericidal.
A feared consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the development of ARDS, which is a major
contributor to morbidity and mortality and dramatically increases the burden on healthcare
systems. ARDS is caused by the massive release of inflammatory cytokines in the lungs, which
occurs in some patients in response to pathogenic infiltration. Both NIC and hLYS are known to
exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. The anti-inflammatory activity of two NIC formulations, NICBSA and NIC-hLYS, was assessed using an acute macrophage inflammation model. NIC-hLYS
and NIC-BSA exhibited similar suppression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a (Fig
4D and E). The similarities in the levels of these two cytokines across the two formulations
tested indicates that the suppression may be related to the activity of NIC rather than hLYS.
Suppression of IL-1b was not observed for either formulation, and the highest concentration of
NIC-hLYS tested (18 µg/mL total powder) resulted in statistically significant increase in
compared to both the untreated, LPS-stimulated control and an equivalent dose of the NIC-BSA
formulation (Fig 4F). Of, note this is an equivalent powder concentration to the dose exhibiting
the highest efficacy in the in vitro antiviral assays.

Figure 4: NIC-hLYS resulted in 50% inhibition of the S. aureus Mu50 strain at lower doses than
several other NIC formulations tested, included solubilized NIC (A-C). Compared to NIC
particles alone, 100% inhibition was achieved at a lower dose (B). Data presented as mean +
SEM (n = 6), **p < 0.01,****p < 0.0001, using two-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple
comparisons test. NIC-hLYS significantly reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6
(D) and TNF-a (G) in THP-1 macrophages stimulated with 10 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
though a significant increase in IL-1b production was noted at the highest dose tested compared
to both the untreated control and NIC-BSA formulation, which may point towards the role of
hLYS in inducing production of this cytokine. Data presented as mean + SEM (n =3), *p < 0.05,

Composite niclosamide-lysozyme particles can be delivered to the upper and lower
respiratory tracts with three different commercially available devices
Targeted delivery of antivirals to the respiratory tract carries substantive benefits for the
treatment of COVID-19, particularly for compounds with limited oral bioavailability like NIC.
However, the wide range of symptoms and disease severity associated with COVID-19 makes
development of a broadly applicable therapy difficult. The clinical applicability of our novel NIChLYS formulation was assessed by determining the delivery efficiency of the drug using three
commercially available respiratory drug delivery platforms: a disposable DPI (TwinCaps®), a
vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo®) and a nasal spray (VP7 Aptar®). The composition of
spray dried NIC-hLYS particles was optimized using a constrained-mixtures design of
experiments (DoE) to achieve respirable dry particles (geometric median diameter ≤ 5 µm) that
could be easily reconstituted as suspension suitable for nasal spray or nebulizer-based
administration. The DoE generated several promising powder formulations (Supplementary
Table 1), of which formulation 8 (F8) was selected for further characterization.

For ambulatory patients, DPIs provide a convenient treatment option for lung-targeted delivery.
The rapid administration time for the device as well as the compact size improves patient
acceptability and compliance. A disposable DPI is likely to be preferred in the treatment of
COVID-19, given the currently unknown risks regarding re-infectability. A commercially available
disposable DPI, the TwinCaps® (Hovione) was therefore selected as an exemplary delivery
platform. NIC-hLYS powder inhalation was successfully delivered using the TwinCaps DPI, with
a 136.0 ± 7.4 µg NIC fine particle dose (i.e., recovered drug mass with less than 5 µm
aerodynamic diameter) achieved per 60 mg total powder actuation (0.7% NIC content) when
using inhalation flow rate conditions reflective of a healthy patient (Fig 5H). Given the potential
for shortness of breath and reduced inspiratory abilities that may occur in COVID-19, the
delivery efficiency was also examined using inhalation flow-rate conditions reflective of a patient
with reduced lung capacity due to illness or age. Similar fine particle doses (121.1 ± 7.7 µg)
were achieved in these reduced inhalation flow rate conditions, which indicates a minimal
dependence on inspiratory flow rate to achieve successful delivery of the drug to the peripheral
lung regions.
COVID-19 may result in the need for mechanical ventilation for continued patient survival. The
delivery efficiency of reconstituted NIC-hLYS particles was assessed using an Aerogen Solo
vibrating mesh nebulizer, which can be utilized aerosol drug delivery in-line with a ventilator
circuit. NIC-hLYS powder reconstituted in 0.45% sodium chloride to a 25 mg/mL concentration
(equivalent to 175 µg/mL NIC) resulted in the delivery of a fine particle dose of 62.3 ± 6.4 µg
NIC after a 2-minute run time (Fig 5H). Furthermore, a range of concentrations (10 to 100
mg/mL) could be successfully emitted using the Aerogen Solo device (Fig 5G). By altering the
reconstitution concentration, the dose of NIC-hLYS could therefore be adjusted if required for
pediatric patients, or those with hepatic or renal insufficiencies. The zeta potential of the
reconstituted NIC-hLYS powder was determined to be +1.8, in contrast to the poorly performing
NIC-BSA particles, which exhibited a zeta potential of -10.9 when reconstituted in water.
Epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract (i.e., nasal passages) exhibit significantly higher
expression of ACE2 receptors than those of the lower respiratory tract, which indicates these
tissues may be more prone to infection with SARS-CoV-2(47). As such, the feasibility of
administration of the NIC-hLYS formulation using a nasal spray was assessed using spray
pattern and plume geometry analysis. NIC-hLYS powders were reconstituted in 0.45% sodium
chloride at concentrations ranging from 10 to 50 mg/mL and actuated using a VP7 Aptar® nasal
spray device. Suitable plume angles and uniform spray patterns for nasal administration were
achieved for all tested concentrations (Fig 5I). An increase in plume angle was noted at
increasing powder concentrations which was inversely related to changes in suspension
viscosity (Supp Table 2) and may be reflective of the decreased surface tension resulting from
the presence of hLYS and other surface-active stabilizers. The utilization of a slightly hypotonic
reconstitution medium (Supp Table 3) was selected and used in the in vivo studies to improve
absorption and potentially assist nose-to-brain penetration of NIC-hLYS. The decreases in brain
and kidney viral titers noted in vivo when NIC-hLYS was administered intranasally may reflect
an achievement of therapeutic drug concentrations outside the respiratory passageways,
though this will be evaluated further in a future pharmacokinetic study.
NIC is a poorly water-soluble drug, which renders the commercially available oral formulation
ineffective against respiratory diseases due to the limited absorption of the drug from the
gastrointestinal tract. Direct delivery to the airways represents a promising alternative to oral
delivery, as it would enable achievement of high levels of drug at the site of disease. However,
limited solubility and delayed dissolution of niclosamide particles in the upper respiratory tract

could result in rapid clearance of the particles by the mucocilliary escalator or through alveolar
macrophage uptake. hLYS exhibits surface active properties which could enhance the
dissolution rate of poorly water soluble NIC particles. To test this hypothesis, the dissolution rate
of NIC-hLYS particles exhibiting an aerodynamic diameter of ~2 µm was compared against
hLYS-free NIC particles in simulated lung fluid medium. Though the deposited particles
exhibited equivalent sizes and surface areas, the inclusion of hLYS as a formulation component
resulted in a slightly faster rate of dissolution, with 82.1% the deposited dose of NIC dissolved
by 6 hours (Fig 5F).

Figure 5: Micronized niclosamide (A) was embedded in a matrix of human lysozyme and
stabilizers using spray drying (B). This novel system was developed as an alternative to
traditional lactose-based carrier systems (C) and enabled the targeted respiratory delivery of
NIC as a powder via DPI or a reconstituted suspension via nebulizer or nasal spray. The
optimized formulation exhibited a size distribution that was appropriate for inhalation (i.e.,
geometric median diameter < 5 µm) in both the dry powder state as well as when reconstituted
using water or 0.45% NaCl (D). Similar effects could not be achieved when a negatively
charged protein, bovine serum albumin, was substituted in the formulation for the positively

charged hLYS (E). Though hLYS is surface active, it appeared to only slightly enhance the
dissolution of NIC compared to NIC particles blended with lactose (F). A respirable droplet size
distribution could be achieved with multiple different reconstituted concentrations when
nebulized using the Aerogen Solo (G). These concentrations resulted in no aggregation to the
lysozyme component. Efficient aerosol delivery was achieved with both the nebulizer and
disposable DPI, with ~50% of the emitted dose being of an appropriate size for lung deposition.
This was significantly improved compared to a traditional lactose carrier particle system (H).
Reproducible plume geometry could be achieved using a variety of reconstituted concentrations
when actuated using the Aptar device (I). Data is presented as mean + SEM (n = 3). *p < 0.05,

Protein aggregation may result in a loss of therapeutic activity or an immunogenic response (4850). We have previously demonstrated that hen egg white lysozyme is robust to processinduced aggregation using typical particle engineering techniques(51), which provided part of
the rationale for its selection as a therapeutically active carrier for the aerosol delivery of NIC
particles. Using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we investigated the formation of higher
molecular weight hLYS aggregates before and after spray drying. No further increases in higher
molecular weight aggregates were noted after spray drying (Supp Fig 1B) or after nebulization
at varying reconstituted concentrations (Supp Fig 1C-F) (Supp Table 4). Interestingly, a
decrease in the percentage of solubilized aggregates was noted in the spray dried hLYS
formulations compared to the initial unprocessed hLYS product, which may be explained by the
shift in secondary structure from towards a higher percentage of parallel b-sheet structure upon
spray drying, whereas the unprocessed hLYS had a higher percentage of anti-parallel b-sheet
structure (Supp Table 5). The glass transition temperature (Tg) measured for the NIC-hLYS
powder was 79.4°C, which makes it suitable for storage in ambient conditions without risk of
further protein degradation. The water content of the spray dried powder was determined to be
8.8% based upon Karl Fisher coulometric titration, which is similar to literature reported values
for the water content of lysozyme.(52)
DISCUSSION
The co-formulation of the cationic, endogenous protein hLYS with micronized NIC produced a 4fold increase in potency against CoVs and a 2-fold increase in potency against MRSA
compared to NIC particles alone. Though the inclusion of hLYS did slightly increase the
dissolution rate of micronized NIC particles, this alone cannot explain the increased potency, as
solubilized NIC exhibited lower antiviral activity at the 0.125 µg/mL dose than both NIC-M and
NIC-hLYS. hLYS plays an important role in the innate immune system, and it is found in
abundance at the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract as well as in the lysosomal granules
of neutrophils and macrophages.(53) The antibacterial efficacy of hLYS stems from both its
enzymatic activity, which results in the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bonds linking peptidoglycan
monomers in bacterial cells walls, as well as its cationic activity, which enables insertion of the
protein and formation of pores in negatively charged bacterial membranes.(46) To our
knowledge, the activity of lysozyme against coronaviruses has not been previously reported. A
peptide (HL9) located within the helix-loop-helix motif of hLYS has been previously
demonstrated to block HIV-1 viral infection and replication, whereas mutants of HL9 did not.(43)
The location of this peptide was deemed to be separate from the hydrolytic site. It is possible
that this peptide sequence, or another, is responsible for the anti-coronavirus activity of hLYS.

Cationic peptides have been hypothesized to exhibit antiviral activity due to a disruption of the
viral particle membrane(54). hLYS may also disrupt various signaling pathways (TGFb, p53,
NFkB, protein kinase C, and hedgehog signaling) which affect host cell susceptibility to viral
infection.(43) An immunomodulatory response may explain the notable delay in anti-SARSCoV-2 activity at lower doses when hLYS was used alone. Additionally, a unique up-regulation
in IL-1b activity was noted for the NIC-hLYS formulation in a macrophage model of inflammatory
stimulation, while expression of other inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a) was decreased. IL-1
family cytokines have been previously associated with the induction of antiviral transcriptional
responses in fibroblasts and epithelial cells.(55) In SARS-CoV infected African green monkeys,
significantly lower levels of IL-1b were noted in the lungs of aged monkeys compared to juvenile
monkeys.(56) Similarly, elderly mice infected with influenza exhibited lower levels of 1L-1b, and
administration of IL-1b augmenting compound improved morbidity and mortality.(57) Thus, it is
possible that a similar immune-mediated mechanism is contributing to the increased activity of
NIC-hLYS compared to other NIC formulations, though this requires further investigation.
At physiological pH, hLYS exhibits a positive charge while NIC exhibits a negative charge. This
attraction may contribute to the improved dispersibility of NIC suspensions when hLYS is
utilized as the carrier protein, as demonstrated by the notable aggregation observed when a
negatively charged protein, BSA, is used in the formulation. This charge-based interaction may
have additional benefits when NIC is in the solubilized state. NIC has two substituted aromatic
rings, the electronegativity of which has been deemed critical for its activity against other
viruses(9). Non-covalent interactions between aromatic compounds is a known phenomenon,
which occurs as a result of the overlap of the p-orbital of the two electron clouds of the aromatic
rings(58, 59) and p-p stacking of NIC is observed in the crystalline form.(60) Though not
investigated in this study, it’s possible that self-association of NIC molecules may disrupt the
availability of the strongly electro-negative groups necessary for antiviral activity. This may
explain why a decrease in antiviral activity was noted with NIC solubilized in DMSO compared
to NIC particles. Interactions between NIC and hLYS in the microenvironment may serve as a
mechanism to disrupt this self-association and ensure availability of the electronegative
functional groups, as lysozyme has been previously demonstrated to complex with negatively
charged molecules (61) and a hydrophobic drug (62). Given the physicochemical properties of
NIC, both charged-based and hydrophobic interactions with hLYS may be important. Future
studies will examine the interactions and mechanisms of complexation between NIC and hLYS
to further elucidate how the molecular interactions may contribute to improved antiviral activity.
At present, there are limited treatment options for COVID-19. In August 2020, the FDA
approved remdesivir for the treatment of all hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with
COVID-19, irrespective of the severity of disease.(63) This approval is based upon a statistically
significant reduction in median time to recovery for patients treated with remdesivir in a recent
clinical trial.(64) However, remdesivir is currently not recommended for use in patients with
acute or chronic kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min), which may limit its utility in severe COVID19 infection. This contraindication stems from the incorporation of sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin
(SBECD), which is utilized as a vehicle for the poorly water soluble remdesivir in the intravenous
product, and which can accumulate in cases of renal failure. Clinical trials examining inhalationbased delivery of remdesivir are currently under way(65, 66), though details of this aerosol
formulation and whether or not it contains SBECD are not provided. A pre-print of a powder
aerosol formulation of remdesivir has also been recently published(67). These studies overall
indicate the clinical interest in the development of an inhalation-based treatment for COVID-19.

Based upon our data, NIC may be a promising alternative or adjunt therapy to remdesivir for the
treatment of COVID-19. A previous study examining the efficacy of remdesivir for the treatment
of a lethal MERS-CoV infection (5 × 105 pfu) followed by treatment 24 hours p.i with remdesivir
resulted in ~2.5-3 log reduction in viral particles in the lung tissue(68), which is similar to the
reduction noted in our study using intranasal NIC-hLYS. At the day 6 p.i. endpoint of the
remdesivir MERS-CoV study equivalent survival (50%) was noted in the treated and untreated
groups. In comparison, at day 7 p.i., we noted 71.4% survival in treated animals versus 60% in
untreated controls, and at day 10 p.i. 43% of treated animals had survived while 0% of
untreated animals had survived. Notably, these animals continued to survive after treatment
was ceased, which was reproduced in the lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection model. While it is
difficult to make comparisons between the two drugs on survival improvement given differences
in study length and inoculum concentration, it appears survival with NIC-hLYS treatment is
comparable if not improved compared to remdesivir treatment in lethal MERS-CoV infections.
Expansion of the dosing range or frequency in future studies, as well as the incorporation of
prophylactic dosing may enable a significant improvement in survival to be achieved, similar to
what was noted with remdesivir when used prophylactically in vivo. Furthermore, we have
demonstrated in vitro efficacy of NIC-hLYS reducing complications related to COVID-19, most
notably secondary bacterial pneumonia by MRSA and dampening (but not complete
suppression) of TNF-a and IL-6, which are known markers for COVID-19 disease severity(69).
This broad-spectrum activity may provide a unique advantage for NIC-hLYS compared to other
leading COVID-19 candidates as an early report on COVID-19 reported 50% of patients that
died had a secondary infection(70). Though NIC appears to be primarily renally cleared(71),
limited data is available regarding the effects that hepatic or kidney failure may have on the
toxicity profile of the drug. Future studies will evaluate the pharmacokinetic distribution of NIChLYS delivered via the intranasal or pulmonary routes.
We have successfully demonstrated NIC-hLYS is effective in vitro and in vivo for the treatment
of COVID-19, and importantly, scalable inhaled drug delivery systems can be developed based
upon the formulation which will enable rapid availability to a global patient population.
Historically, it has been observed that variations in patient inspiratory force can have profound
effects on the magnitude and region of dose delivery to the airways from DPIs.(72) One of the
most common symptoms of COVID-19 is shortness of breath, reportedly occurring in 50.8% of
patients.(73) Moreover, patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have
shortness of breath than patients with non-severe infection.(73) NIC-hLYS powder exhibited
efficient aerosol performance using a disposable DPI device even at reduce inspiratory efforts
which will ensure reproducible dose delivery throughout disease progression, as well as in
pediatric patients. The powder can be reconstituted at the point of care to form a stable
suspension appropriate for nebulization, thus enabling treatment of both ambulatory and
severely ill or mechanically ventilated patients. Lastly, NIC-hLYS suspension could be
reproducibly actuated using a commercially available nasal spray device and has demonstrated
promising antiviral activity in vivo when administered to infected mice via the intranasal route.
The utilization of a slightly hypotonic carrier may improve systemic penetration from the nasal
route and promote distribution in the brain(74, 75). SARS-CoV-2 has been found to exhibit
neuroinvasive properties, and severely affected COVID-19 patients appear to be more likely to
develop neurological symptoms compared to those with mild disease(76, 77). We observed that
the brain tissue of surviving, NIC-hLYS treated animals with SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited no
detectable viral particles. NIC-hLYS delivered by the intranasal route may therefore be effective
in preventing viral invasion of brain tissue or reducing viral replication within brain tissue.
We acknowledge limitations within our study, namely the lack of pharmacokinetic data which
may explain the mechanism of viral load reduction in brain, kidney, and lung tissue, as well as

the utilization of only one dosing level of NIC-hLYS in the SARS-CoV-2 model. In our study, we
utilized a “worst-case scenario” of efficacy evaluation by administering lethal inoculums of CoVs
and initiating treatment 24 hours after the infection was established(78). The effect of the timing
of treatment initiation, i.e., prophylactic versus 24 or 48 hours p.i., was not examined.
Incorporation of prophylactic dosing may result in the increased efficacy of NIC-hLYS, as the
antiviral mechanism of action of NIC may be related to the prevention of viral entry into host
cells.(9) Future studies will examine these variables, based upon the notable activity of the
novel NIC-hLYS formulation in these initial proof-of-concept efficacy studies.
In conclusion, a novel formulation of NIC-hLYS optimized for delivery to the upper and lower
respiratory tracts as a powder or stable suspension was developed. In vitro, the incorporation of
hLYS into the formulation was noted to improve potency against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,
as well as MRSA, which is an important causative agent for secondary bacterial pneumonias
associated with COVID-19. The NIC-hLYS particles exhibited suppression of the inflammatory
cytokines TNF-a and IL-6, which have been implicated in the development of more severe
COVID-19, while elevating the production of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1b, which may
contribute to enhanced antiviral activity. Intranasal administration of NIC-hLYS particles
improved survival and reduced viral tissue loads in vivo in two lethal CoV infections at a level
that was comparable to the leading COVID-19 treatment candidate, remdesivir. Thus, NIC-hLYS
is likely to not only have efficacy in the treatment of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but
could be utilized as a treatment in future CoV pandemics.
METHODS
Engineering and optimization of inhalable composite particles of niclosamide and human
lysozyme
Niclosamide (NIC) was obtained from Shenzhen Neconn Pharmtechs Ltd. (Shenzhen, China)
and micronized in-house using an Model 00 Jet-O-Mizer air jet mill (Fluid Energy Processing
and Equipment Co, Telford, PA, USA) using a grind pressure of 75 PSI and a feed pressure of
65 PSI for a total of three milling cycles to achieve an x50 diameter of 2.2 µm and an x90
diameter of 4.1 µm. To generate a powder formulation of NIC suitable for DPI-based delivery as
well as suspension-based nebulizer and nasal spray delivery, micronized NIC particles were
embedded in a matrix of recombinant human lysozyme (hLYS) (InVitria, Junction City, KS,
USA), sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany), polysorbate 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
histidine (Sigma-Aldrich) using spray drying. Our group has previously identified that histidine
(buffering agent), sucrose (lyoprotectant agent), and polysorbate 80 (surface active agent) can
be used to generate stable and dispersible formulations of lysozyme for delivery via DPI (51,
79).
Preliminary screening experiments indicated that spray drying with a feed solid content greater
than 1% w/v resulted in a dry particle size distribution (PSD) that was greater than the respirable
size (typically less than 5 µm particle diameter). A constrained mixtures DoE was therefore
utilized to determine the optimal ratio of micronized niclosamide, human lysozyme, sucrose, and
polysorbate 80 in the 1% w/v feed to generate powder with both a dry and reconstituted PSD
suitable for oral or nasal inhalation (Supplementary Table 6).
The upper constraint of polysorbate 80 was selected to match the maximum FDA approved
level of the excipient for the inhalation route.(34) The lower level of human lysozyme was set at
60% w/w, based upon previously published results indicating that a respirable powder cannot be
generated below this level(80). Sucrose and polysorbate 80 lower level constraints were set at

conservative values, as their inclusion is necessary to ensure stability of lysozyme during the
drying process, but the lowest level needed for stability has not been defined. The micronized
niclosamide lower and upper constraints were selected to be around the point at which the
average number of particles is excepted to be one, based upon equation 1(81).
$

𝑑"
𝑥̅ = 𝐹! % '
𝑑#

Eq 1

Where 𝑥̅ is the average number of particles per droplet, 𝐹! is the volume fraction of particles of
diameter 𝑑# , 𝑑" is the diameter of the particles (assumed to be equivalent to the X90 diameter
of the micronized niclosamide particles) and 𝑑# is the diameter of the droplets (assumed to be
equivalent to the X90 diameter of the atomized droplets at conditions used in the experiment).
A constrained mixtures DoE was generated using the RSM package(82) in the opensource
software R(83). Of these 25 mixtures, a 12-run D-optimal subset (Supplementary Table 7) was
generated and prepared using spray drying to enable fitting of the results to the Scheffé
quadratic model. The dry components of the formulations were mixed using a process of
geometric dilution and wetted and suspended using polysorbate 80 followed by incremental
additions of 0.174 mg/mL histidine buffer. All suspensions were spray dried with a BUCHI B-290
mini-spray dryer (BUCHI Corporation, New Castle, DE, USA) coupled to a syringe pump (KD
Scientific Inc, Holliston, MA, USA) set at a feed rate of 1 mL/min. A 2-fluid pneumatic atomizer
nozzle (0.7 mm with 1.5 mm cap) was used to atomize the suspension, and house air was used
as the atomization gas. The cleaning needle of the nozzle was removed to prevent disruptions
to the feed flow rate.(51) The spray dryer was set at an inlet temperature of 130°C, which
corresponded to an outlet temperature of ~70°C. For all runs, no settling of the feed
suspensions was noted during processing. Formulations were evaluated on the basis of dry
powder PSD and reconstituted suspension PSD, and the composition exhibiting the most
promising characteristics was selected for further evaluation. Comparative powders were
generated for the purposes of evaluation of physicochemical characteristics, aerosol
performance, and efficacy. A NIC-free hLYS spray dried powder was generated using the
optimized formulation composition identified in the DoE, minus the addition of micronized NIC.
To compare the novel NIC-hLYS powders against a traditional lactose-based carrier system,
micronized NIC was blended with crystalline lactose particles (Lactohale 100; DFE Pharma)
using geometric dilution followed by mixing in a Turbula powder blender. The concentration NIC
in the niclosamide-lactose blend (NIC-Lac) was set to match that in the NIC-hLYS powder
(0.7%). Lastly, a powder was generated in which bovine serum albumin (BSA) was substituted
for the hLYS in the optimized NIC formulation, in order to assess the effect of the protein on
formulation characteristics.
2. Physicochemical characterization of niclosamide-lysozyme composite particles
Particle size distribution (PSD) of NIC-hLYS powders was measured using a RODOS disperser
coupled to a Sympatec laser diffractor unit (Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany).
Dispersion pressure was set at 3.0 bar and feed table rotation was set at 20%. Time slices of
the plume exhibiting an optical concentration between 5-25% were averaged to generate the
PSD. The PSD of the reconstituted powders was determined in both ½ normal saline (NS) and
DI water using the Cuvette attachment for the laser diffraction. A spin bar was set to rotate at
2000 RPM, and the dry powders were added directly to the solvent in the cuvette until an optical
concentration exceeding 5% was reached. Three measurements were taken and averaged.
Zeta potential of NIC-hLYS suspensions before and after spray drying was determined using a

Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern Panalytical Ltd, Malvern, UK) and compared against a NIC-BSA
suspension.
The morphology of NIC-hLYS powders was observed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Samples were mounted onto aluminum stubs using double-side carbon tape and sputter
coated with 15 nm of platinum/palladium (Pt/Pd) under argon using a Cressington sputter coater
208 HR (Cressington Scientific Instruments Ltd, Watford, UK). Images were obtained using a
Zeiss Supra 40VP SEM (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany).
Glass transition temperature (Tg) and crystallinity of NIC-hLYS powder was determined using
modulated DSC. Powder samples were loaded into Tzero pans with hermetically sealed lids,
and a hole was pierced to prevent pan deformation. A scan was performed on a Q20 DSC (TA
Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) by ramping 10°C/min to -40°C, followed by a 2°C/min ramp
from -40°C to 280°C with a modulation cycle of ±0.5°C every 40 seconds. Data was processed
using TA Universal Analysis.
The dissolution profile of the aerosolized NIC-hLYS and NIC-Lac powders was evaluated based
upon previously published methods (84, 85) using a composition of simulated lung fluid (SLF)
adapted from Hassoun et al (86). Briefly, Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filters (diameter = 24
mm) were placed in a Stage 4 of a Next Generation Impactor, which corresponded to an
aerodynamic size cut off of 2.01 µm at the 40 L/min flow rate used in the experiment. Powders
were dispersed using a disposable TwinCaps (Hovione) DPI. The filters were transferred to a
modified Transwell system (membrane removed) to enable contact of the bottom of the filter
with a basal compartment containing 1.5 mL SLF. The apical side of the filters were wetted with
0.1 mL of SLF. The dissolution results are presented in Table 3. The Transwell system was
placed in a 37°C isothermal chamber and 0.1 mL samples were removed from the basal
compartment at various timepoints and replaced with fresh SLF.
3. Stability analysis of human lysozyme
Effects of processing and nebulization on the aggregation of hLYS was assessed using size
exclusion chromatography (SEC) based upon a previously published method (80). The effect of
processing on the secondary structure of hLYS was determined using a Niclolet iS50 Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer with attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) (Thermo
Scientific). Spectra were acquired using OMNIC software from a wavelength of 700 cm-1 to 4000
cm-1 with 64 acquisitions in total. An atmospheric background scan was collected and
subtracted from all powder spectra. Secondary structure analysis was performed in OriginPro
(OrginLab Corporation) using the second derivative of the amide I band region (1580-1720 nm)
and the peak analyzer function. The region of interest was first baseline-corrected, and the
second derivative of the spectra was smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay method with a
polynomial order of 2 and 50 points in the smoothing window. Peaks identified from the second
derivative minimums were iteratively removed to assess the effect on the model fit.
4. Aerosol performance testing
The aerosol performance of the spray-dried composite NIC-hLYS powder was assessed using a
disposable TwinCaps DPI. Performance was assessed at both a 4kPa and 2kPa pressure drop
through the device to determine the effects of inspiratory flow rate on emitted and fine particle
dose. For comparative purposes, the performance of traditional lactose carrier-based dry
powder, NIC-Lac, was also assessed. A 4 kPa pressure drop was generated through the
TwinCaps DPI using an inspiratory flow rate of 40 L/min. A 6.5 second actuation time was used

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.24.310490; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

to pull 4 L of air through the NGI. A 2 kPa pressure drop was generated using an inspiratory
flow rate of 28.3 L/min, and an 8 second actuation time was used. For all experiments, 60 mg of
powder was loaded into the device. After actuation of NIC-hLYS powders, niclosamide was
collected by dissolving the deposited powder using a 50-50 water:acetonitrile mix. An aliquot
was taken, and an additional volume of acetonitrile was added to bring the final ratio to 20:80
water:acetonitrile. To induce phase separation, A 2M solution of ammonium acetate was added
to this mixture at a volume that was 20% of the water:acetonitrile mix. Niclosamide was assayed
from the upper organic layer by measuring absorbance at 331nm using a plate reader. For the
niclosamide-lactose blend, the deposited powder was collected by dissolving it in 20:80
water:acetonitrile, centrifuging, and then measuring absorbance at 331nm.
Delivery of the reconstitued NIC-hLYS suspension was assessed using the disposable
Aerogen® Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen). Preliminary screening experiments
indicated that a reconstituting 25 mg/mL of NIC-hLYS powder in 0.45% w/v sodium chloride (1/2
NS) reduced the changes in nebulizer concentration during therapy compared to higher
concentrations; therefore, this concentration was utilized for further analysis. The inspiratory
flow rate was set for 15 L/min and the apparatus was chilled to 4°C as specified by the United
States Pharmacopeia (USP)(87). Nebulization was performed for two minutes to ensure
sufficient deposition of drug in the stages for analysis.
After drug collection, aerosol performance was evaluated on the basis of emitted fraction or
dose (niclosamide mass emitted from the device as a percentage of the total recovered powder)
and fine particle fraction (niclosamide mass with a size cut off of less than 5 µm aerodynamic
diameter or 3 µm aerodynamic diameter, as a percentage of the emitted dose). NGI stage cutoffs were determined for the flow rate utilized based upon Eq. 2, while the MOC cut-off diameter
was determined using Eq. 3.

Where 𝐷%&,( is the cut-off diameter at the flow rate 𝑄, 𝐷%&,() is the cut-off diameter at the
archival reference values of Qn = 60 L/min, and the values for the exponent, x, are those
obtained from the archival NGI stage cut size-flow rate calculations determined by Marple et
al(88). Aerosol performance was evaluated on the basis of emitted fraction (EF), which is
defined as the cumulative mass emitted from the device as a fraction of the recovered mass,
fine particle fraction less than 5 µm (FPF<5µm), defined as the mass less than 5 µm aerodynamic
diameter as a fraction of the emitted dose, and the fine particle fraction less than 3 µm (FPF<3µm)
The FPF<5µm and FPF<3µm values were interpolated from a graph plotting the cumulative
percentage of NIC deposited in a stage against the cut-off values of the stage.
5. Nasal spray characterization
To evaluate the utility of the optimized NIC-hLYS powders for nasal administration, suspensions
of varying concentrations (10 mg/mL, 25 mg/mL, and 50 mg/mL) were prepared in 1/2 NS and
placed in a VP7 pump Aptar® pump meter spray device. Spray patterns and plume geometries
were evaluated using laser-assisted high speed imaging based on methods previously reported
by Warnken et al.(89) Briefly, the loaded spray devices were actuated using a MightyRunt

automated actuator (InnovaSystems, Inc) set at parameters that mimic those of an average
adult user(90). A laser-sheet was oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the actuated spray
at distances of 2 and 5 cm from the nozzle tip in order to assess the plume geometry and spray
pattern, respectively. The actuation was conducted in a light-free environment in order to isolate
the portions of the spray photographed by the high-speed camera (Thorlabs, Inc.) from those
illuminated in the plane of the laser. Image analysis of the plume geometry and spray pattern
were permed in Fiji.(91) For the plume geometry, the outline of the observed plume was traced
and the slope of each side of the plume was determined. This was used to calculate the angle
formed at the intersection of the two lines. The spray pattern characteristics including maximum
and minimum diameters were determined using the software’s measurement function to
determine the Feret diameters.
6. In vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy
The ability of the optimized NIC-hLYS formulation to dampen inflammatory response was
evaluated using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in a THP-1 macrophage model. THP-1
monocytes were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 4 x 105 cells/mL (5 mL total) in
RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 15 ng/mL
phorbol 12-myristate (PMA) to induce differentiation into mature macrophages. The cells were
incubated in the presence of PMA for 48 hours, after the media was replaced with PMA-free
media and cells were rested for 24 hours. NIC-hLYS and NIC-BSA powders were suspended in
RMPI 1640 media at varying concentrations (2 to 18 µg/mL, based on total powder content) and
added to the cells simultaneously with 10 ng/mL LPS. The cells were then incubated for 6 hours
to achieve peak cytokine expression(92). Following incubation, supernatants were collected,
and cytokine concentrations were quantified using ELISA (DuoSet, R&D Systems) and
compared against untreated controls.
7. In vitro efficacy
All antiviral efficacy experiments were performed using Vero-E6 cells obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia, USA). Vero-E6 cells were maintained in Minimal
Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1X antibioticantimycotic solution (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) (i.e., MEM complete). Cells were infected with
either MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) or SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV2/human/Korea/CNUHV03/2020 strain). All experimental procedures involving potential contact
with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in a biosafety level 3 laboratory of Chungnam
National University, which was certified by the Korean government.
7.1. Efficacy determined by viral titer
Vero-E6 cells (2 X104/ml) were seeded in the wells of 6-well tissue culture plates. After a 3-day
incubation period, cells were washed with warm PBS (pH 7.4) twice and were infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 X 103 pfu) or MERS-CoV (2 X 104 pfu) diluted in MEM with 2% FBS, which
was followed by a 24-hour rest period. The media was then replaced with MEM complete
containing various concentrations of the investigational formulations (prepared as suspensions).
For the assessment of solubilized NIC, stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the drug in
DMSO, and the diluting in MEM-complete, with the resulting media not containing more than 1%
DMSO. Drug concentrations and formulations were assessed in triplicate. For each 6-well plate,
1 well was utilized as untreated control. Cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours, at which point
viral RNA from samples was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Viral

step RT qPCR Kit (Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea) and SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV primers
and probe (Supplementary Table 8). Real-time amplification was performed using a Rotor-Gene
6000 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). An initial incubation was performed at 50°C for 30 minutes
and at 95°C for 10 minutes, after which 45 cycles of a 5 second hold at 95°C and a 30 second
hold at 60°C were performed. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were converted to plaque forming
units (pfu) using a standard curve generated from data using stock viruses with known pfu titers
by plaque assay.
7.2. EC50 determination
Vero-E6 cells grown in tissue culture flasks were detached by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and
were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates. When confluent, cells were washed with warm
PBS (pH 7.4) and infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. The half maximal effective
concentration (EC50) of the formulations was assessed by dosing infected Vero E6 cells plated
in 96-wells with NIC-hLYS suspensions with NIC content ranging from 0.25 µg/mL to 0.004
µg/mL once daily over the course of 72 hours. Cell viability was determined on day 4 by
observing cytopathic effects (CPE) under microscope. The EC50 was calculated as the
concentration of NIC resulting in no observable CPE in 50% of the wells. For comparative
purposes, the EC50 of micronized NIC without the inclusion of hLYS was also evaluated.
7.3. Inhibitory activity against S. aureus
The inhibitory activity of various NIC formulations (NIC-hLYS, NIC-M, NIC-BSA, and NICDMSO) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain Mu50 was assessed using a resazurinbased 96-well plate microdilution assay(93). Varying concentrations of the NIC formulations (: 4,
2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.0313, 0.0156, 0.008 µg/mL, dosed based on NIC content) were
plated with a 5 x 105 cfu/mL inoculum of S. aureus (n = 6 per dose). One column of the plate
was used as growth control, i.e., no antibiotics were added, while another column was used as
a sterile control, i.e., no bacteria added. The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C with
150 RPM shaking, after which point 30 µL a 0.015% resazurin sodium solution was added. The
plates were incubated for an additional 2 hours to allow color change to occur, and the
fluorescence of the wells was read at 530 nm excitation/590 nm emission. The fluorescence of
the sterile wells was subtracted from the fluorescence of all treated wells, and a decrease in
fluorescence of the treated wells versus the growth control was noted as inhibitory activity. The
content of wells exhibiting 100% inhibition were plated on tryptic soy agar plates and incubated
overnight to determine the mean bactericidal concentration (MBC).
8. In vivo efficacy assessment
8.1. MERS-CoV infection
HDPP-4 transgenic mice were kindly provided by Dr. Paul B. McCray Jr (University of Iowa).
MERS-CoV infection was initiated in anaesthetized mice by intranasal (i.n.) administration of 50
µL (1 × 105 pfu) of MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain), which was kindly Drs Bart Haagmans and
Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center). Efficacy was initially established using a dose- finding
study, in which treatments were initiated 1-day post-infection (p.i.) and daily for 6 days, at which
point animals (n = 3 from each group) were sacrificed. NIC-hLYS powder was reconstituted in
0.45% sodium chloride to achieve a dose of 60 or 120 µg/kg NIC (n = 7 per group). The
suspensions were administered i.n. in a volume of 50 µL, and 50 µL of 0.9% sodium chloride
was administered as a control (n = 6). Though a second timepoint was intended for day 9, death
due to illness or as a result of treatment administration prevented obtainment of these data. A
separate study was conducted to compare the survival of MERS-CoV-infected mice treated with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.24.310490; this version posted October 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

240 µg/kg NIC-hLYS (n = 7) and placebo (n = 6). In this study, mice were dosed intranasally for
10 days, at which point treatment was terminated. Surviving mice were rested without treatment
for an additional 3 days, and sacrifice was performed Day 14 p.i. to obtain tissues (lung and
brain) for viral titres and tissue pathology. The weight of mice was recorded daily. Tissues (0.1 g
per sample) were homogenised using a BeadBlaster homogeniser (Benchmark Scientific,
Edison, New Jersey, USA) in 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) to measure virus titres by RT-qPCR. The
remaining portions of tissues were used for histopathology. Mice were lightly anaesthetized with
isoflurane USP (Gujarat, India) prior to all viral inoculation and dosing procedures.
8.2. SARS-CoV-2 infection
HACE-2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2 mice) (The Jackson Laboratory, USA) were lightly
anaesthetized with isoflurane USP (Gujarat, India) and inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 50 µL
(1 × 104 pfu) of SARS-CoV-2/human/Korea/CNUHV03/2020. Animals were rested for 24-hours,
after which daily treatment was initiated with i.n. NIC-hLYS reconstituted in 0.45% sodium
chloride (240 µg/kg NIC) (n = 13) or 0.9% sodium chloride as a placebo (n = 8). All treatments
were performed on anaesthetized mice. On day 6 post-infection, 3 mice per group were
euthanized, and lung, brain and kidney tissues were collected for viral titres and tissue
pathology. Treamtne was performed until 10 days p.i., at which point surviving animals were left
untreated for 3 days, and then sacrificed on day 14 p.i. to obtain tissues for viral titres and
pathology. Tissues (0.1 g per sample) were homogenised using a BeadBlaster homogeniser
(Benchmark Scientific, Edison, New Jersey, USA) in 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) to measure virus
titres by RT-qPCR. The remaining portions of tissues were used for histopathology.
8.3. Preparation of tissues for histopathology
Mouse tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (10%) and then embedded in
paraffin. The lung tissue was cut into 5 μm sections, which were stained with haematoxylin (H)
solution for 4 min. The stained tissue sections were washed with tap water for 10 min and then
stained with eosin (E) solution. The stained sections were visualised under an Olympus DP70
microscope and photographed (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
8.4. TCID50 assay
To determine whether measured viral particles in lung and brain tissue were dead or alive, the
log10TCID50/mL was determined. Vero-E6 cells grown in tissue culture flasks were detached by
treatment with trypsin-EDTA and were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates with MEM
containing 10% FBS and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution. When confluent, the cells were
washed with warm PBS (pH 7.4) and infected with virus samples, which were 10-fold diluted in
MEM with 2% FBS. The cells in four wells were infected with the diluted virus samples for 4
days in a humidified incubator at 37°C. The cells were observed for CPE under microscope.
8.5. Antibody detection
The presence of IgG antibody specific for MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in the sera of infected
and treated animals was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The
purified and inactivated MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 antigen was diluted to final concentration of
100μg/ml in coating buffer (carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). The diluted antigen (100μl)
was coated to the wells of a Nunc-Immuno™ MicroWell™ 96 well solid plates (Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, USA) and was incubated overnight at 4°C. After removing the coating buffer, the plate was
washed twice by filling the wells with 400μl of washing buffer (0.05% tween 20 PBS (pH 7.4)

containing 4% horse serum). To block the remaining protein-binding sites, 400μl of blocking
buffer (PBS containing 4% skim milk) was added to the plate and incubated overnight at 4℃.
The buffer was removed, and sera (100μl diluted in 1:64 in PBS) collected from treated mice on
14 days post treatment were added to the plate and incubated for 1hr at room temperature. The
plate was washed 4 times with washing buffer. Goat anti-Mouse IgG Cross-Adsorbed
Secondary Antibody HRP (Invitrogen, MA, USA) was diluted (1:5000) in blocking buffer, and
100 µL was added to each well and incubated for 1hr at room temperature. After washing the
plate 4 times with the washing buffer, 100 µL of the TMB ELISA substrate (Mabtech, Nacka
Strand, Sweden) was dispensed into the wells and incubated for 30min at 4℃. ABTS®
Peroxidase Stop Solution (KPL, MD, USA) (100μl ) was then added to the plate. The
absorbance of each well was measured at 450nm using iMARK™ Microplate Absorbance
Reader (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
8.6. Statistical analysis
Survival curves in both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 lethal infection models were evaluated for
statistical significance using the Mantel-Cox test. Statistical analysis on tissue homogenate viral
titres was performed using a two-way ANOVA with Dunnet’s multiple comparisons test to
evaluate post-hoc differences between groups. Alpha was set at 0.05. Statistical analysis was
performed using Prism8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
8.7. Ethics approval
Protocols for the study of SARS-CoV-2 drug efficacy (202003-CNU-023) and MERS-CoV drug
efficacy (CNU-01192) in mice was approved by the Internal Animal Use Committee at
Chungnam National University (CNU). All the studies were approved and were conducted in
accordance with the relevant legal guidelines and regulations prescribed by CNU, Republic of
Korea.
