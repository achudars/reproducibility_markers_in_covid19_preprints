Abstract

29

On 22 January 2020, the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC), part of the China National

30

Center for Bioinformation (CNCB), created the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource

31

(2019nCoVR), an open-access SARS-CoV-2 information resource. 2019nCoVR features a

32

comprehensive integration of sequence and clinical information for all publicly available

33

SARS-CoV-2 isolates, which are manually curated with value-added annotations and quality

34

evaluated by our in-house automated pipeline. Of particular note, 2019nCoVR performs

35

systematic analyses to generate a dynamic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations at a

36

global scale. It provides all identified variants and detailed statistics for each virus isolate, and

37

congregates the quality score, functional annotation, and population frequency for each

38

variant. It also generates visualization of the spatiotemporal change for each variant and

39

yields historical viral haplotype network maps for the course of the outbreak from all

40

complete and high-quality genomes. Moreover, 2019nCoVR provides a full collection of

41

SARS-CoV-2 relevant literature on COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), including

42

published papers from PubMed as well as preprints from services such as bioRxiv and

43

medRxiv through Europe PMC. Furthermore, by linking with relevant databases in

44

CNCB-NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers data submission services for raw sequence reads and

45

assembled genomes, and data sharing with National Center for Biotechnology Information.

46

Collectively, all SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, variants, haplotypes and literature are

47

updated daily to provide timely information, making 2019nCoVR a valuable resource for the

48

global research community. 2019nCoVR is accessible at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/.

Introduction

53

The severe respiratory disease COVID-19 [1], since its outbreak in late December 2019, has

54

rapidly spread as a pandemic. As of 14th July 2020, 12,964,809 confirmed cases have been

55

reported in 216 countries/territories/areas (WHO Situation Report Number 176;

56

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). As the

57

causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 samples have been extensively isolated and

58

sequenced by different countries and laboratories [2], resulting in a considerable number of

59

viral genome sequences worldwide. Therefore, public sharing and free access to a

60

comprehensive collection of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences is of great significance for

61

worldwide researchers to accelerate scientific research and knowledge discovery and also

62

help develop medical countermeasures and sensible decision-making [3].

63
64

To date, unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences generated worldwide were scattered

65

around different database resources, primarily including the Global Initiative on Sharing All

66

Influenza Data (GISIAD) [4] repository and NCBI GenBank [5]. Many sequences exist in

67

multiple repositories but their updates are not synchronized. This makes it extremely

68

challenging for worldwide users to effectively retrieve a non-redundant and most updated set

69

of sequence data, and to collaboratively and rapidly deal with this global pandemic. Towards

70

72

access to a complete collection of non-redundant global SARS-CoV-2 genomes by

73

comprehensive integration and value-added annotation and analysis [6]. Since its inception on

74

22 January 2020, 2019nCoVR is updated on daily basis, leading to unprecedentedly dramatic

75

data expansion from 86 genomes in its first release to 64,789 genomes in its current version

76

(as of 14th July 2020). Moreover, it has been greatly upgraded by equipping with enhanced

77

data curation and analysis pipelines and online functionalities, including data quality

78

evaluation, variant calling, variant spatiotemporal dynamic tracking, viral haplotype

79

construction, and interactive visualization with more friendly web interfaces (Table 1). Here

we report these significant updates of 2019nCoVR and present the global landscape of

Statistics of SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies

85

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences released

globally has been increasing at an unprecedented rate. To facilitate public free access to all

87

genome assemblies and help worldwide researchers better understand the variation and

transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we perform daily updates for 2019nCoVR by integrating all

89

available genomes throughout the world and conducting value-added curation and analysis

90

(Figure 1). As of 14th July 2020, 2019nCoVR hosted a total of 64,789 non-redundant genome

91

sequences and provided a global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in 97

92

countries/regions across 6 continents (Figure 1A). Duplicated sequences from different

93

databases are merged with all IDs cross-referenced. Sequences are contributed primarily by

94

United Kingdom (28,823, 44.5%), United States (13,556, 20.9%), Australia (2351, 3.6%),

95

Spain (1852, 2.9%), Netherlands (1605, 2.5%), India (1581, 2.4%), and China (1431, 2.2%).

96

According to our statistics, SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences started to grow rapidly from

97

mid-March (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/release_genome), concordant with the outset of global

98

pandemic of COVID-19. A full list of our sequence dataset including strain name, accession

99

number and source is provided in Table S1.

100
101

To provide high-quality genome sequences that are critically essential for downstream

102

analyses (ranging from variant calling to haplotype construction), we perform sequence

103

integrity and quality assessment for all newly collected sequences. Among all released

104

human-derived genome sequences (64,700), 60,970 (94.2%) are complete, and 31,689 (49%)

105

are high-quality (with high coverage) (Figure 1B). Most of the low-quality sequences (29,281,

106

99.7%) contain different numbers of unknown bases (Ns). Among these sequences, 60% have

107

16-500 Ns (median 258), and 40% have more than 500 Ns (Figure 1C). Further investigation

108

of the genomic locations reveals that some genomic regions have high coverage of Ns (Figure

109

1D). Sequence integrity and quality assessment results are available for all genome sequences,

110

and can be used as filters for sequence browse and search.

111
112

Landscape of genomic variants

113

Bases on 31,685 globally human-derived high-quality complete genome sequences (in what

114

follows, only high-quality complete genome sequences are used for downstream analysis if

115

not indicated otherwise), we investigate the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants by

116

comparison with the reference genome (MN908947.3 in NCBI) (Figure 2). By 14th July 2020,

117

a total of 13,428 variants were identified, including 12,828 (95.5%) single nucleotide

118

polymorphisms (SNPs), 437 deletions, 116 insertions, and 47 indels (a combination of an

119

insertion and a deletion, affecting 2 or more nucleotides) (Figure 2A). More than half of these

120

SNPs (6770, 50.4%) are nonsynonymous, causing amino acid changes. To gain the functional

121

effects of those missense variants of S spike protein from the perspective of spatial location

122

(e.g. key functional domain or binding region), mutated amino acids are projected onto

123

protein 3D structures, which can be viewed by 360 degree rotation (Figure 2B). We further

124

explore the distributions of these variants across different genes. Noticeably, the three genes

125

ORF1ab, S, and N accumulate more variants (Figure 2C) and SNP densities (i.e., the number

126

of mutations per nucleotides in the gene region) are higher in several gene regions including

127

ORF7a, ORF3a, ORF6 and N (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/annotation).

128
129

For each variant, we investigate its population mutation frequency (PMF, the ratio of the

130

number of mutated genomes to the total number of complete high-quality genomes) (Figure

131

2D). Clearly, there are 62 variants with PMF > 1%, 18 variants with PMF > 5%, and 4

132

variants with PMF > 75.8% (that is, position 241 in 5’UTR, positions 3037 and 14,408 in

133

ORF1ab, and 23,403 in S), potentially representing main prevalent virus genotypes across the

134

global. All identified variants and their functional annotations are publicly accessible and an

135

online pipeline for variant identification and functional annotation is provided and freely

136

available at https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/analysis.

137
138

Spatiotemporal dynamics of genomic variants

139

To track the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants, particularly de novo mutations, we

140

explore the spatiotemporal change of population frequency for each variant according to

141

sampling time and location (Figure 3). Among the 18 sites with PMF > 5%, some are

142

mutated simultaneously and in a linkage manner (Figure 3A), such as mutations at positions

143

8782 and 28,144 reported in [7]. Specifically, these two sites appeared in the early stage of the

144

outbreak since 30 December 2019, and their mutation frequencies reach ~33% around 22

145

January 2020, and then gradually decline to 9.6% currently. Contrastingly, some variants

146

appear only since the middle stage around 3 March 2020; such as the mutation at position

147

23,403 (provoking an amino acid change D614G of the S protein), is accompanied by three

148

other mutations, namely, a C-to-U mutation at position 241 in the 5’UTR, a silent C-to-U

149

mutation in the gene nsp3 at position 3037, and a missense C-to-U mutation in the gene RdRp

150

at position 14,408 (P4715L). To facilitate users to investigate any variant of interest, we

151

provide an interactive heatmap in 2019nCoVR (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/heatmap)

152

to dynamically display and cluster the mutation patterns over all sampling dates, with

153

customized options available that allow users to select specific variant frequency, annotated

154

gene/region, variant effect type, and transcription regulation sequence (TRS).

155
156

Moreover, we investigate dynamic patterns of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants across different

157

sampling locations over time. Taking the variant at position 23,403 (D614G) as an example,

158

its PMF has dramatically increased from 0 at the end of February to 76.2% right now, and the

159

mutation pattern G614 has been gradually dominant along with the development of pandemic

160

(Figure 3B), presumably indicating that the mutated genotypes may have higher

161

transmissibility[8]. In terms of the absolute number of mutation patterns across different

162

countries/regions, G614 emerges dominantly in Europe and North America (Figure 3C).

163

(https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/annotation/variant/23403).

164

mutation pattern for each country (Figure 4), we find that sequences from some Asian

165

countries (such as South Korea, Malaysia, and Nepal) have no or very few G614 mutation,

166

whereas those from Europe and America (e.g. Argentina, Czech Republic and Serbia) do have

167

the G614 pattern that is dominated among contemporary samples. In some countries, both the

168

D614 and G614 patterns are co-circulating early in the epidemic, but the mutated pattern soon

169

begins to be dominant such as in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, France, Israel, United

170

States and United Kingdom [8]. The accumulation of this mutation varies in different parts of

171

the world, possibly due to the prevention and control measures adopted by some

172

countries/regions. Taken together, 2019nCoVR features spatiotemporal dynamics tracking of

173

SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants and thus bears great potential to help decipher viral

174

transmission and adaptation to the host [8].

178

based on all identified variants beyond UTRs regions. As a result, 17,624 haplotypes were

179

identified from 31,685 complete high-quality genome sequences as of 14th July 2020. Based

180

on this, we construct a haplotype network for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5), a graphical

181

representation of genomic variations by inferring relationships between individual genotypes,

182

according to the principle of the shortest set of connections that link all nodes (genotypes)

183

where the length of each connection represents the genetic distance [9]. To provide a whole

184

picture of the pandemic transmission in a spatiotemporal manner, we visualize the

185

SARS-CoV-2 haplotype network by sample collection date and across different

186

countries/regions. It not only allows users to easily obtain a landscape of SARS-CoV-2

187

haplotypes and their relationships, but also helps users to navigate a set of haplotypes for a

188

specific country/region linking with additional associated information such as the number of

189

genomes, sampling time and location (Figure 5A).

190
191

According to the haplotype network, we classify all genome sequences into nine major

192

clusters (labelled as C01–C09; see Methods for details) (Figure 5B, 5C; Table 2). As the

193

ongoing pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, new branches that evolve and spread faster are

194

gradually emerging, such as clusters C04, C06, C08, and C09 (Table 2). The dominant

195

clusters are C06 (8681, 27.4%), C08 (7,889, 24.9%), and C09 (6,940, 21.9%) (Figure 5D),

196

which are characterized by those signature mutations of C241T, C3037T, C14408T, and

197

A23403G, and are defined as the G clade (as the mutation at position 23,403 provoking an

198

amino acid change D614G of S protein). These sequences have spread to 82 countries

199

worldwide, and become the main epidemic virus type in most countries in Europe, North

200

America, South America, Africa and West Asia, etc. For example, there were about 6827

201

(71.5%), 8305 (83.4%), and 970 (18.5%) sequences originated from the G clade in the United

202

States, United Kingdom, and China, respectively (Figure 5E). The wide spread and

203

prevalence of this clade in different countries may suggest the adaptability of the virus type to

204

human [8].

well as Semantic-UI (an open source web development framework; https://semantic-ui.com).

211

In the server-side, it was implemented by using Spring Boot (a rapid application development

212

framework based on Spring; https://spring.io). For data storage, MySQL (https://mysql.com)

215

documents based on data; https://d3js.org) and 3Dmol.js (a JavaScript library for visualizing

216

protein structure associated with mutated amino acids) [21] were employed in 2019nCoVR.

217

The haplotype network was implemented by d3js, Leaflet (http://leafletjs.com), and Echarts

218

(http://echarts.baidu.com/).

Discussion

221

Genome sequencing is vital to understand the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, since it is not

222

only useful for deciphering its genome sequences and investigating its evolution and

223

transmission, but also highly effective at determining whether individuals are part of the same

224

transmission chain [10]. According to 2019nCoVR, however, the ratio of sequenced samples

225

to the number of confirmed cases is very low in some countries/regions (Figure S1), and even

226

genome sequences are unavailable in some affected countries/regions. The SARS-CoV-2

227

sampling bias and depth may lead to inaccurate transmission patterns and phylogenetic

228

relationships [11]. Based on sequencing all infected cases in a single region, it has proved that

229

the transmission of Clostridium difficile from symptomatic patients accounts for only one

230

third of all infected cases [12]. As our current understanding is still very limited, we call for

231

more efforts and collaborations in sequencing more SARS-CoV-2 genomes from both

232

symptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

233
234

Besides, as these released SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were generated by multiple

235

different laboratories on different sequencing platforms, the quality of genome sequences is

236

another important factor, such as the Ns of genome, which may affect variant calling and

237

biased population frequency estimation. As mentioned in results, the frequency of Ns in some

238

genomic regions is high, possibly due to the low sequencing coverage, low-complexity of

239

sequence, low-efficiency of PCR primers used in sequencing library construction, secondary

240

structure of RNA, etc. However, most of the sequencing coverage information is unavailable,

241

making it challenging to evaluate whether the Ns were due to low sequencing coverage. By

242

further investigating those genomic regions with high frequency of Ns, we found (1) their GC

243

and AG contents are close to the average of the whole genome, excluding the possibility of

244

low complexity of sequence; (2) the length of these regions ranges from 210 to 320 bp

245

(similar to the length of PCR product) and more than 60% of the related sequences are

246

generated on Illumina platform (based on PCR amplification), suggesting that those Ns

247

regions may be resulted from low-efficiency of PCR Primers during sequencing library

248

construction; (3) by analyzing the secondary structure of these regions’ RNA sequences, we

249

found the minimum free energy is lower than those randomly extracted regions, indicating

250

that the secondary structure is more stable and may affect the determination of genome

251

sequences(Figure S2). Our future efforts are to construct a recognized benchmark for quality

252

assessment and data filtration.

253
254

Compared to the early overly simplified L-S classification [8] and those comprehensive

255

lineages defined by Rambaut et al. [13], our classification scheme with nine clusters provides

256

a moderate system that can be correlated with the others (Table 2). The nine clusters could

257

also be grouped into three clades defined in [8, 10], namely, S (C02 and C04), G (C06, C08

258

and C09), and L (the rest clusters). Although haplotype network cannot give a precise

259

evolutionary position as phylogenetic trees do, it can be used to quickly inform the clustering

260

of viruses according to signature mutations in each haplotype. Definitely, new clusters will be

261

introduced as the virus is continuing to evolve.

262
263

A data-driven response to SARS-CoV-2 requires a public, free, and open-access data resource

264

that contains complete high-quality genome sequence data, and equips with automated online

265

pipelines to rapidly analyze genome sequences. Thus, 2019nCoVR (together with other

266

resources in CNCB-NGDC) provides a wide range of data services, involving raw sequencing

267

curation, variation analysis and data presentation and visualization. Additionally, to facilitate

269

worldwide users to monitor any variant that may be associated with rapid transmission and

270

high virulence, 2019nCoVR R, when compared to GISAID and NCBI Virus, features

271

spatiotemporal dynamic tracking for all identified variants. To better understand the

272

epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, future directions are to collect ever more genome sequences

273

worldwide, include other types of omics data (such as transcriptome and epitranscriptome, if

274

available) [14] and also provide more friendly interfaces and online tools in support of

275

worldwide research activities.

276
277

Methods

278

Data collection and integration

279

All genome sequences as well as their related metadata were integrated from SARS-CoV-2

280

resources worldwide, including NCBI [5], GISAID [15], CNCB-NGDC [16], NMDC [17]

281

and CNGB [18]. To provide a non-redundant dataset, duplicated records from different

282

databases were identified and merged.

283

Quality control and curation

284

To determine the integrity of genome sequences, one sequence is defined as ‘Complete’ if it is

285

longer than 29000 bases and covers all protein-coding/CDS regions of SARS-CoV-2 (bases

286

266:29674 of GenBank: MN908947.3); otherwise, it is defined as “Partial”. Furthermore, to

287

examine the quality of genome sequences, unknown bases (Ns) and degenerate bases (Ds,

288

more than one possible base at a particular position and sometimes referred as “mixed bases”)

289

were counted for each sequence. By our default definition, one sequence is “high-quality” if

290

Ns≦15 and Ds≦50, and “low-quality” otherwise. Besides, any sequence is clearly labelled

291

when the number of variants≧15 or the total number of deletion≧2 or the distribution of

292

sequence variation is more aggregated (the ratio of the number of variants divided by the total

293

number of bases in a window≧0.25).

294

Variant identification and haplotype network construction

295

Only complete and high-quality genome sequences were used for downstream analyses,

296

including sequence comparison, variant identification, functional annotation, and haplotype

297

network construction. Genome sequence alignment was performed with Muscle (3.8.31) [19]

298

by comparing against the earliest released SARS-CoV-2 genome (MN908947.3). Sequence

299

variation was identified directly using an in-house Perl program. The effect of variants was

300

determined using VEP (ENSEMBL Variant Effect Predictor) [20].

301
302

SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes were constructed based on short pseudo sequences that consist of all

303

variants (filtering out variations located in UTR regions) only. Then, all these pseudo

304

sequences were clustered into groups, and each group (a haplotype) represents a unique

305

sequence pattern. The haplotype network was inferred from all identified haplotypes, where

306

the reference sequence haplotype was set as the starting node, and its relationship with other

307

haplotypes was determined according to the inheritance of mutations. As a result, nine major

308

haplotype network clusters (denoted as C01– C09) were obtained according to the

309

phylogenetic tree-and-branch structure and those shared landmark mutations (Table 1).

310

Specifically, mutations with PMF≧5% (except for ATG deletion at position1605, PMF≈3% )

311

were selected, and those co-occurred mutations were determined by LD linkage analysis. A

312

cluster was referred to sequences with those co-occurred landmark mutations.
