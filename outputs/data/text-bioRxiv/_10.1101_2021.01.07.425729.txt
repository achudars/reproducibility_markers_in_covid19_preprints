Abstract

27

Reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have already been documented in humans, although its

28

real incidence is currently unknown. Besides having great impact on public health, this

29

phenomenon raises the question if immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient

30

to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The

31

Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological

32

mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of

33

mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated

34

hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days

35

upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after primary

36

challenge, and despite high titers of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were

37

susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614)

38

SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently

39

infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first

40

inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to

41

elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.

Introduction

46

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological

47

agent of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory affection that

48

spread globally with an unprecedented rapidity and severity, impacting both

49

international public health and economics. To date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than

50

84 million people globally, resulting in more than 1.8 million deaths, as reported by the

51

World Health Organization 1.

52

Unraveling immunopathological disorders caused by SARS-CoV-2 is one of the priorities

53

of the scientific community. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a rapid production of

54

neutralizing antibodies 2; however, the magnitude of a neutralizing response as well as

55

its decay correlates directly with the severity of the disease. To date, longitudinal studies

56

confirmed the duration of neutralizing antibodies for 2 to 5 months post-symptoms

57

onset

58

identical or other viral variants is still not clear. The first evidence of COVID-19

59

reinfection was described by August 25th, 2020 7. This study reported reinfection of an

60

individual 142 days after the first infectious episode. The patient did not display any

61

symptom during the second infection; viruses belonging to different SARS-CoV-2 clades

62

were identified from the first and second episodes. Immediately after this first case,

63

other SARS-CoV-2 reinfections have been reported in several countries, including The

64

Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Qatar, South Korea, United States, Ecuador and

65

India

66

compared to the first infectious event and ranged from asymptomatic to severe disease,

67

being more intense during the second infections in few patients. In all cases, differences

68

in viral genomic sequences were identified between the first and second infections.

69

Experimental reinfection studies have been performed in non-human primates (NHPs),

70

transgenic mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2),

71

Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed and RAG2-knockout Golden Syrian

72

hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) and cat (Felis catus)

73

challenged with the same SARS-CoV-2 isolate developed a protective non-sterilizing

74

immunity. Currently, there is no data available about the induction of protective

75

immunity conferred by a given strain versus another variant.

76

The Golden Syrian Hamster is a suitable model to study COVID-19 18,19. SARS-CoV-2 can

77

replicate on both upper and lower respiratory tracts in this animal model. Upon

78

challenge, animals develop a mild-to-moderate disease with a recovery period ranging

79

from one to two weeks. Importantly, infection with SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters

80

recapitulates several lesions observed in the human lower respiratory tract. These

81

include pneumonia with bilateral lungs involvement, ground-glass opacities, presence

82

of focal oedema, inflammation, and acute respiratory distress syndrome

83

excluding hamsters, only NHPs partially reproduce the clinical picture experienced by

84

COVID-19 human patients. In addition, age and sex-linked differences in SARS-CoV-2

85

infection and clinical signs have been reported in hamsters, reflecting human similarities

86

18,21. Thus, the golden Syrian hamster could be an appropriate model to study SARS-CoV-

87

2 reinfections.

88

Here, we test the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to reinfect golden Syrian hamsters using two

89

variants of the virus: Cat01, a variant isolated from a human patient in Spain and WA/1

90

a variant isolated from a human patient in the USA. The Cat01 isolate differs from the

91

WA/1 one by the presence of 15 single point mutations. Among them, the most striking

92

is at the 614 position of the Spike protein gene; the WA/1 isolate possess a wild-type

13–17.

In all models, animals re-

D614 spike protein, while the Cat01 isolate displays the G614 mutation. S-G614 strains

94

emerged for the first time in Europe during March 2020 and quickly spread globally,

95

arriving almost at fixation and replacing S-D614 variants

96

demonstrated that D614G variants have a higher transmission capacity 23–25 and reach

97

higher viral loads in the upper airways 26. It is therefore important to gain insights into

98

mechanisms of reinfection and the development of protective immunity using different

99

viral strain, which could interfere with a primary infection event.

22.

Further studies

100

Our results demonstrate that animals exposed to Cat01 variant developed a cross-

101

protective but not sterilizing immune response against a second infection event,

102

regardless of the viral variant used for the re-challenge. Importantly, we showed that

103

identical and variant viral strains could successfully infect the upper respiratory tract of

104

re-challenged animals, but no evidence of infection occurred at the lower respiratory

105

tract.

Results

108

Hamsters do not lose weight after SARS-CoV-2 reinfection

109

The level of protection conferred by prior inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 was explored.

110

Weight loss was used to clinically track infection and reinfection 15 (Figure 1). Hamsters

111

inoculated for the first time with 105.8 TCID50/animal of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Cat01 (n=24)

112

showed a progressive reduction of weight starting from 1 until 5 day post infection (dpi)

113

compared to the mock-inoculated animals (Figure 1A), according to what has been

114

previously described

115

3.56% (SD ± 4.34%; n = 16) at 5 dpi. From 6 dpi onwards, animals recovered weight in a

116

similar trend to that of the control group, indicating the beginning of the clinical

13,19.

The maximum mean weight loss for infected animals was -

117

recovery. Mean weight differences between SARS-CoV-2 and mock-infected animals

118

were statistically significant starting from 2 dpi. On day 21 after inoculation, twelve

119

animals that underwent a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Cat01 isolate were re-

120

challenged with Cat01 (n= 6) or WA/1 (n= 6) isolates, at a final concentration of 105.2

121

TCID50/animal. Upon reinfection with both variants, animals did not have statistically

122

significant weight variations compared to the control group (Figure 1B).

123
124

SARS-CoV-2 causes rhinitis and bronchointersticial pneumonia upon infection but

125

minimal to no lesions upon reinfection

126

Moderate to severe inflammatory lesions were observed in nasal turbinates at 2 and 4

127

dpi, being mild at 7 dpi. Animals developed multifocal to diffuse, muco-purulent to non-

128

suppurative rhinitis, which was more evident in the mid and caudal turbinates. Epithelial

129

cell cilia loss was observed multifocally at 2 and 4 dpi. At 7 dpi, the same lesions were

130

observed but considered mild. Upon re-inoculation, nasal turbinates showed mild

131

lesions at 23 dpi, that is 2 days post-re-inoculation (2 dpri), and dpi 25 (4 dpri), like those

132

observed on 7 dpi. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) detected by

133

immunohistochemistry (IHC) in nasal turbinates correlates with the intensity of lesions,

134

showing high, moderate and low amounts of viral antigen at 2 dpi (Supplementary figure

135

1 (Sp1), a), 4 dpi (Sp1, b) and at 7 dpi (Sp1, c) respectively. Upon re-inoculation, the

136

amount of labelling tended to be mild-to-moderate at 23 dpi (2 dpri) (Sp1, d-e) and very

137

mild at 25 dpi (4 dpri) (Sp1, f-g). Viral antigen was mainly located in nasal epithelial cells,

138

including cells morphologically resembling olfactory neurons and sloughed epithelial

139

cells in the nasal meatus, as well as submucosal gland cells.

140

Mild non-suppurative tracheitis with very mild patchy loose of the respiratory

141

epithelium cilia was observed at 2 dpi; no evident lesions were observed on the other

142

days. All hamsters tested positive by IHC at 2 dpi, and only two animals had very mild

143

labelling at 4 dpi. No immunohistochemical signal was detected at 7 dpi or after re-

144

inoculation with none of the two SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Supplemental figure 1).

145

At 2 dpi, all hamsters displayed mild to moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia (Figure

146

2a). At 4 dpi, lesions were moderate, including hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes.

147

Multifocal presence of fibrin within alveoli containing inflammatory cells was also

148

observed (Figure 2b). Loss of cilia in affected respiratory airways was evident. The same

149

type of lesions but more severe were observed at 7 dpi (Figure 2c). At 2 dpri and 4 dpri

150

lesions were equivalent to those described at 4 dpi, being from very mild to moderate

151

(Figures 2d and 2e). Immunohistochemical labelling of SARS-CoV-2 NP at 2 dpi varied

152

from low to high and was mainly observed in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial

153

cells and type I pneumocytes, following a patchy distribution (mainly in peribronchial

154

and peribronchiolar locations) (Figure 2f). At 4 dpi, SARS-CoV-2 NP protein distribution

155

was similar to that at 2 dpi but with higher amount of labelling in the lung parenchyma

156

and less in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia. Noteworthy, type II pneumocytes

157

and mononuclear cells were scarcely labelled (Figure 2g). Lungs tested positive at 7 dpi

158

only in two animals. In these samples, the number of labelled cells was very scarce, and

159

was characterized by the presence of small foci of type I pneumocytes containing viral

160

antigen (Figure 2h). All lung samples were negative at 2 and 4 dpri (respectively 23 and

161

25 dpi) (Figures 2i and 2j).

162

No histopathological findings were found in any of the available mediastinal lymph

163

nodes. By immunohistochemistry, the only available lymph nodes from 2 dpi (n=1) and

164

4 dpi (n=2), displayed low numbers of dendritic-like cells (stellate appearance)

165

containing viral antigen in the cytoplasm (Supplementary figure 2). No labelling was

166

detected in any of the mediastinal lymph nodes from hamsters at 7 dpi (n=2), 2 dpri

167

(n=3) and 4 dpri (n=4).

168

No apparent differences in lesion severity or immunohistochemical labelling were

169

observed for any tissue upon re-inoculation with any of the two different SARS-CoV-2

170

strains. A summary of the severity of lesions and the amount of viral antigen per each

171

individual hamster is displayed in the Supplementary table 1.

172
173

A previous SARS-CoV-2 priming prevents re-infection of the lower respiratory tract

174

We assessed viral genomic and subgenomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA (gRNA and sgRNA,

175

respectively) levels in nasal turbinates, trachea, lungs and oropharyngeal swabs at 2, 4

176

and 7 dpi (n=4/day) and 2 and 4 dpri (n=3/day/viral variant) (Figure 3). In addition, we

177

analyzed gRNA and sgRNA levels in oropharyngeal swabs (OS) before the re-challenge

178

to confirm that animals cleared the infection.

179

After the first inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 gRNA loads peaked at 2 dpi in all anatomical

180

compartments and then progressively decreased, accordingly to previous findings

181

Viral loads in oropharyngeal swabs were similar at 2 and 4 dpi but decreased by 7 dpi

182

(Figure 3a). Upon re-inoculation, gRNA levels of both viral strains were significantly

183

lower in all sample types in comparison to those obtained during the first infection

184

(Figure 3a). Only limited viral gRNA levels were detected in trachea and lungs of re-

185

infected animals, regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 variant used. we detected higher gRNA

186

levels in Cat01 (G614) re-infected nasal turbinates after 2 dpri once compared to WA/1

187

(D614) infected samples. This result is in accordance with recent studies 26 and suggests

188

an improved viral fitness conferred by the G614 mutation in the upper airway of infected

189

hamsters.

190

To confirm whether gRNA detection correlated with SARS-CoV-2 replication along the

191

host cells, we monitored the sgRNA levels, following a previously described

192

methodology

193

levels in all hamster samples but also peaked at 2dpi and followed a similar declining

194

trend over time, as previously reported

195

possible in one nasal turbinate and three out of four oropharyngeal swab samples. Once

196

the animals were re-inoculated, sgRNA of both viral variants was detected in nasal

197

turbinates at 2 and 4 dpri, but only at 2 dpri in OSs. We did not detect sgRNA in trachea

198

and lungs at any time point post-re-inoculation, suggesting that both viral strains were

199

not able to successfully replicate in these organs upon reinfection (Figure 3b).

200

Then, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and sgRNA loads obtained from the two

201

infection events. We found statistically significant reductions of both genomic and

202

subgenomic viral RNA levels in samples of reinfected animals when compared to those

203

obtained after the first challenge; statistics are summarized in Supplementary table 2.

204

In addition to the molecular detection of gRNA and sgRNA, the infectious viral titers

205

were measured in Vero E6 cells and expressed as TCID50/mL. We detected infectious

206

virus particles in all tissues and OSs at 2 and 4 dpi; however, no infectious virus samples

207

were found from 7 dpi onwards (Figure 3c). Infectious viral loads were particularly high

208

in nasal turbinates at 2 dpi and 4 dpi. The lack of virus isolation at 7 dpi samples

209

(consistent with the low levels of sgRNA and viral antigen detection) and the remission

210

of clinical signs of animals (weight) starting from 5 dpi, indicate that these animals

211

possibly cleared the infection and stopped shedding infectious virus around 7 dpi.

27,28

(Figure 3b). The levels of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA were lower than gRNA

14,27.

Detection of sgRNA at 7 dpi was only

212

After re-challenge, at 2 dpri, we recorded the presence of infectious virus in two out of

213

four nasal turbinate samples of hamsters re-exposed to the Cat01 isolate. Similarly, only

214

one animal inoculated with the WA/1 variant displayed infectious virus in the nasal

215

turbinates. Re-infected positive animals were much less susceptible to infection than

216

those experimenting a first challenge (Figure 3c). Indeed, values’ variations obtained by

217

quantifying genomic RNA, subgenomic RNA or infectious viral particles were statistically

218

significant (Supplementary Table 2). Conversely, we were not able to identify infectious

219

SARS-CoV-2 particles from trachea, lungs or OSs of re-inoculated hamsters at any time

220

point, regardless of the viral variant used.

221
222

Hamsters developed a neutralizing humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2

223

from 7 days post infection

224

To monitor humoral immune responses elicited by golden Syrian hamsters upon

225

infection with SARS-CoV-2, we used the serum of individual hamsters collected until 7

226

dpi and those generated during the re-infection period (2 and 4 dpri). In addition, serum

227

was prepared from animals before the reinfection procedure (21 dpi) and pooled in

228

groups of four (according to animal caging at the BSL3 facility) to detect the levels of

229

antigen-specific humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. The levels of immunoglobulins

230

targeting specific viral antigens encompassing the S protein (S1+S2), the receptor

231

binding domain (RBD) and the NP were detected using an in house ELISA (Figure 4a, 4b

232

and 4c). Seroconversion against all tested proteins was evident by 7 dpi, although S

233

specific antibody levels were notably lower than those against the RBD and NP, probably

234

due to a lower sensitivity of the S-ELISA compared with the RBD one. Data obtained from

235

sera collected at 21 dpi suggested that total antibody levels targeting the S glycoprotein

236

and those recognizing specifically the RBD subdomain incremented between 7 and 21

237

dpi. Conversely, the level of NP-specific antibodies notably decreased at 21 dpi. After re-

238

inoculation, the levels of antibodies against S, RBD and NP antigens further increased

239

until 25 dpi (4 dpri) independently of the strain.

240

We then evaluated the neutralization activity of sera obtained from all animals excepted

241

those collected at 21 dpi. Neutralization activity was detected from 7 dpi onwards, and

242

sharply increased at 2 and 4 dpri (Figures 4d and 4e), similar to kinetic profiles of antigen-

243

specific antibodies detected by ELISA. Importantly, the humoral response generated

244

against the Cat01 strain after the primary infection was able to neutralize G614 and

245

D614 viral isolates (Cat01 and WA/1, respectively). Moreover, animals were protected

246

from reinfection at the lower respiratory tract against both homologous and

247

heterologous variants. Thus, the high titer of neutralizing antibodies detected already at

248

7 dpi (and onwards) might explain the partial protection (at the lower respiratory tract

249

but not the upper one) of these animals against the re-challenge, which further caused

250

a booster neutralizing effect.

251
252

Discussion

253

The golden Syrian hamster represents an animal model able to recapitulate some

254

infection/re-infection events found in humans. Specifically, this model is characterized

255

by mild-to-moderate clinical, pathological and virological outcomes upon infection with

256

SARS-CoV-2, and minimal virological outcome at the upper respiratory tract upon

257

reinfection with a D164-homologous or a G614-heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants.

258

Results obtained during the primary infection are comparable to those reported in

259

previous studies

260

SARS-CoV-2. The golden Syrian hamster reproduces the mild-to-moderate COVID-19

261

induced pathology described in humans, especially in the lower respiratory tract

262

Furthermore, we also demonstrated for the first time that reinfection can occur at the

263

upper respiratory tract of this species using either homologous or heterologous SARS-

264

CoV-2 variants. However, our results of virus titration, gRNA and sgRNA detection

265

indicate that negligible or nil viral infection and replication occurred in the lower

266

respiratory tract of re-infected hamsters, regardless of the viral variant used.

267

Conversely, both viral isolates were able to infect nasal turbinates of animals having

268

resolved a primary infection. These results are aligned with those described by van

269

Doremalen et al. 29, which showed that immune responses generated by an adenovirus-

270

vectorized ChAdOx1 vaccine, encoding the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, prevented viral

271

replication in the lower respiratory track of challenged rhesus macaques but not at the

272

nasal turbinates. Importantly, no viral gRNA reduction was recorded in the upper

273

respiratory tract of non-human primates and vaccinated animals shed high quantities of

274

infectious virus. Similarly, we found infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in 1 or 2 out of 4

275

nasal turbinate samples of hamsters re-exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 WA1 or CAT01

276

isolates, respectively. These results suggest that human re-infections might also occur

277

in the upper respiratory tract since a previously generated immunity is not sterilizing at

278

the nasal level.

279

Our study showed that infected animals developed specific humoral immune responses

280

against different proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 from 7 dpi onwards. As mentioned before,

281

S and RBD specific antibodies increased after 7dpi. Conversely, levels of NP-specific

282

antibodies decreased until day 21 pi. In a recent study, Chen et al. 30 analyzed the IgG

283

kinetic profile of infected human patients, highlighting that SARS-CoV-2 infection

284

induced a distinct temporal profile of humoral responses against different viral proteins.

285

These observations demonstrated that levels of NP-specific IgGs tend to sharply

286

decrease after 14-20 days post-symptoms in humans, similar to our observation in the

287

hamster model. Moreover, the virus neutralization assay indicated that infected

288

hamsters developed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Previous studies

289

in COVID-19 patients have correlated levels of serological and mucosal neutralizing

290

antibodies

291

phenomenon could have occurred in the golden Syrian hamster model after the primary

292

SARS-CoV-2 infection. These animals might have mounted a strong mucosal and

293

serological humoral response able to neutralize the virus at the lower respiratory tract

294

upon a secondary infection, as evidenced by the high seroneutralizing antibody

295

responses from 7 dpi onwards. This protective effect was observed in trachea and lungs

296

independently of the viral variant used for re-inoculation purposes. Remarkably, the

297

immunity developed by challenged hamsters was not sterilizing, and localized infection

298

at the upper respiratory tract was still possible upon reinfection. However, animals

299

rapidly cleared the virus by day 4 dpri, similarly to what was previously described in

300

African Green monkeys 33 and Rhesus macaques 15 models.

301

In line with results obtained using the golden Syrian hamster model, protection from a

302

secondary infection was also described in rhesus macaques after two consecutive SARS-

303

CoV-2/WA1 inoculations 14. Although low levels of viral replication were reported in the

304

nasal cavity of these non-human primates, disease prevention was also associated with

305

the presence of high neutralizing antibody levels in sera 14, a fact that would also apply

306

in the studied hamsters.

which have also been associated to infection clearance. The same

307

On the other hand, previous studies in human patients have characterized T cell

308

responses against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 34,35, demonstrating the important role of

309

the cellular components of the immunity to resolve these Sarbecovirus infections. In

310

addition, specific T cell responses generated by the pre-exposition to seasonal human

311

coronaviruses (HCoV)-229E and OC43 or the zoonotic SARS-CoV have been

312

demonstrated to cross-react and also target SARS-CoV-2 epitopes 36,37. A recent study

313

from Brocato et al.

314

Golden Syrian hamsters severely affected the clinical outcome of the SARS-CoV-2

315

infection, resulting in an increased weight loss and higher viral loads found in the lungs,

316

and suggesting a critical role of T-cells in the early phase of infection. The role of cellular

317

and mucosal immunity was not addressed in the current work and, therefore, further

318

studies would be required to understand immune mechanisms involved in the

319

protection against SARS-CoV2 reinfection.

320

It was already known that seasonal HCoVs like HKU1, OC43, or 229E can re-infect the

321

same host 38,39, suggesting a similar potential scenario for SARS-CoV-2. In fact, several

322

confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection have been described worldwide since mid-

323

August 2020 7–11. To date, all reinfection cases were described by sequencing different

324

SARS-CoV-2 variants between the first and second episodes of infection. In the golden

325

Syrian hamster model both homologous and heterologous variant reinfections were

326

possible. Re-exposed animals did not show evident clinical signs during the short phase

327

of reinfection (2 to 4 days). Conversely, reinfections in humans have been linked to

328

different clinical outcomes. Symptomatic reinfection ranged from more severe

329

milder forms 7 9. Furthermore, asymptomatic reinfection has also been described 11. This

330

variability might be the result of multiple factors as the overall health condition of the

13

proved that disruption of lymphocytes in immunosuppressed

331

patient, the initial viral load or reinfection with a viral strain with higher replication

332

fitness and, importantly, the level of neutralizing antibodies and specific T-cells at the

333

time of subsequent infection event. More studies are needed to establish if different

334

clinical outcomes are possible in case of reinfection using the hamster model. This might

335

be obtained by modifying several aspects of the experimental design as for example

336

increasing the viral load between challenges or using immunosuppressed animals as

337

suggested by Brocato et al 13.

338

The overall frequency of reinfections in the human population is difficult to establish,

339

since a high number of them could pass unnoticed. These could lead to underestimate

340

the rate of reinfection cases, especially if the period between infections was particularly

341

short. In fact, a recent report highlighted that reinfection is possible within one month

342

from the onset of clinical symptoms

343

estimated to be approximately 0.36 per 10,000 person/week

344

significant numerically, taking into account the high number of new infection cases

345

being reported daily 1. Therefore, massive testing and systematic monitoring of the

346

population that has been infected once would probably lead to a much higher detection

347

of reinfections than those reported so far. In our study, the percentage of reinfected

348

animals showing infectious virus in the upper respiratory tract was notable: 1 out of 3

349

with animals receiving the heterologous variant and 2 out of 3 that were re-inoculated

350

with the homologous variant. These data emphasize the interest of the golden Syrian

351

hamster as a model to study reinfection mechanisms.

352

In summary, the golden Syrian hamster can be considered a convenient animal model

353

to study reinfection pathogenesis and immune responses. Specifically, this animal

354

species can suffer from a clinical frame resembling mild-to-moderate disease in humans,

10.

Currently, the incidence rate of reinfection is

which is rather

and reinfection with homologous (G614) or heterologous (D614) variants yielded to a

356

subclinical infection of the upper respiratory tract. No sterilizing immunity was elicited

after the first infection event; however, the lower respiratory tract was fully protected

387

Study design

388

A total of thirty-four 5-6-week-old male and female golden Syrian hamsters (Charles

389

River) were used in this study (Figure 5). Under isoflurane anesthesia, 24 hamsters were

390

inoculated by intranasal instillation with 105.8 TCID50 of the SARS-CoV-2 Cat01 isolate per

391

animal (100 µL/individual, 50 µL for each nostril). Ten hamsters were mock intranasally

392

inoculated with PBS (100 µL/individual, 50 µL for each nostril) and used as negative

393

controls. Body weight was monitored daily during the first week post-inoculation and 4

394

days post-re-inoculation. For virological and pathological examinations, 4 inoculated

395

and 2 control hamsters (half male and half female) were sacrificed on days 2, 4 and 7

396

dpi. The weight of remaining hamsters (n= 12 inoculated and n= 4 control) was recorded

397

at 10, 14 and 21 dpi.

398

At 21 dpi, 6 animals from the inoculated group were intranasally re-inoculated with 105.2

399

TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Cat01 isolate (100 µL/individual, 50 µL for each nostril), while the

400

other 6 animals received the same dose of the WA1 isolate. The four control hamsters

401

were re-inoculated with the same amount of PBS serving as negative controls of the re-

402

inoculation. Inoculation procedures were the same as those used for the first part of the

experiment. For virological and pathological examinations, 3 inoculated animals for each

404

viral isolate and 2 control animals were sacrificed at 23 dpi (2 dpri) and 25 dpi (4 dpri).

405

At necropsy, samples from nasal turbinate, trachea and lung were taken and fixed by

406

immersion in 10% buffered formalin. For molecular detection and viral titration

407

purposes, a portion of the same tissues were placed in individual Eppendorf tubes

408

containing 500 µl of DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (PS)

409

(GIBCO) with a single zinc-plated, steel, 4.5-mm bead. Samples were homogenized at 30

410

Hz for 2 min using a TissueLyser II (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and centrifuged for

411

30 sec at 11,000 rpm. All samples were stored at -70ºC. Blood samples were collected

412

from each animal at the necropsy day by cardiac puncture under deep anesthesia,

413

centrifugated 10 minutes at 2100 rpm at RT and stored at -70ºC for further analysis.

414

Similarly, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected before the sacrifice under

415

deep anesthesia, resuspended in 500 µl of DMEM supplemented with 1% PS and stored

416

at -70ºC for further analysis. Clinical evolution as well as pathological, immunological

417

and virological outcomes were evaluated at different time points as indicated in Figure

Evaluation of the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 by ELISA

455

The level of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in hamster serum samples was determined

456

using a sandwich-ELISA. Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4ºC with

457

50 μL of capture antibody (anti-6xHis antibody, clone HIS.H8; ThermoFisher Scientific)

458

at 2 μg/mL in PBS. Then, plates were blocked for two hours at room temperature using

459

PBS/1% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Miltenyi biotech) and 50 μL (1μg/mL in blocking

460

buffer) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S1+S2), receptor-binding domain (RBD) or nucleocapsid

461

protein (NP) (Sino Biologicals, Beijing, China) were added and incubated overnight at

462

4ºC. Each sample was diluted in blocking buffer and assayed in duplicated. Diluted

463

samples were incubated overnight at 4ºC. Antigen free wells were also assayed in

464

parallel in the same plate to evaluate sample background. Serial dilutions of a positive

465

serum sample were used as standard. As secondary antibody, an HRP-conjugated Goat

466

anti-hamster IgG (H+L) (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 1/20,000 dilution in blocking buffer

467

was used. Secondary antibody was incubated for one hour at room temperature. Plates

468

were revealed using o-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) (Sigma Aldrich) and

469

stopped with 4N of H2SO4 (Sigma Aldrich). The signal was analyzed as the optical density

470

(OD) at 492 nm with noise correction at 620 nm. The specific signal for each antigen was

471

calculated after subtracting the background signal obtained for each sample in antigen-

472

free wells. Results are shown as arbitrary units (AU).

Live virus neutralization assay

475

Prior neutralization assay, sera samples were heat inactivated at 56 ºC for 30 minutes.

476

Inactivated sera samples were serially 2-fold diluted (range 1/40 to 1/20,480) in DMEM

477

supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM glutamine

478

(all ThermoFisher Scientific), mixed with SARS-CoV-2 Cat01 or WA/1 isolates and further

479

incubated at 37 C for 1 hour). Each dilution (in duplicates) containing 100 TCID of virus

480

solution. The mixtures were then transferred to Vero E6 cell monolayers (ATCC CRL-

481

1586) and cultured for 3 days at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cytopathic effects of the virus were

482

measured after 3 days using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega),

483

according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was measured in a Fluoroskan

484

Ascent FL luminometer (ThermoFisher Scientific).

485
486

Statistical analysis

487

Statistical analyses were completed using GraphPad Prism 8. Mean weight data were

488

analyzed using a multiple unpaired t-test for comparison of 2 groups (infection) and

489

Mixed-effect model (REML) with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test for the

490

comparison of 3 groups (reinfection). Normality of each data set for gRNA, sgRNA and

491

infection viral loads was calculated using Shapiro–Wilk test. Comparison of viral loads

492

between primary challenge and rechallenge was performed with ordinary one-way

493

ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparison (paired test) or Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s

494

multiple comparison test (unpaired test). In all analyses, a P value <0.05 was considered

495

statistically significant.

Figure 5. Experimental Design. Golden Syrian hamsters (n=24, 12 male and 12 female)
were intranasally (IN) inoculated with 105.8 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 Cat01 isolate. Before
challenge blood samples and oropharyngeal swabs (OS) were collected from all animals.
At 2-, 4- and 7-days post-inoculation (dpi), 4 infected animals (2 male and 2 female) were
euthanized. Before necropsy, blood samples and OS were collected from each animal.
Nasal turbinate, lungs and trachea were collected for pathological and virological
analyses. In purple, samples used for ELISA and seroneutralization test; in green,
samples used for histopathology and immunohistochemistry; in yellow, samples used
for RT-qPCR and viral titration in Vero E6 cell. At 21 dpi, the remaining animals (n = 12)
were equally divided in two experimental groups. One group was intranasally inoculated
with 105.2 TCID50 of Cat01 isolate while the other was IN inoculated with WA/1 strain at
the same concentration. At day 23-dpi (2 days-post re-inoculation) and 25-dpi (4 dayspost re-inoculation), 3 animals/experimental group were euthanized. Sampling was
equivalent to that indicated previously. Created with BioRender.com
