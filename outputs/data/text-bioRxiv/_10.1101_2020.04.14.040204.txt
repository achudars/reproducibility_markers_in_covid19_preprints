COVID-19 is caused by a new strain of coronavirus called SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), which is a positive sense single strand RNA virus. In humans, it binds to angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with the help a structural protein on its surface called the Sspike. Further, cleavage of the viral spike protein (S) by the proteases like transmembrane
serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) or Cathepsin L (CTSL) is essential to effectuate host cell
membrane fusion and virus infectivity. COVID-19 poses intriguing issues with imperative
relevance to clinicians. The pathogenesis of GI symptoms, diabetes-associated mortality, and
disease recurrence in COVID-19 are of particular relevance because they cannot be
sufficiently explained from the existing knowledge of the viral diseases. Tissue specific
variations of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry related receptors expression in healthy individuals can
help in understanding the pathophysiological basis the aforementioned collection of
symptoms.

components of the digestive tract. A digestive system specific functional enrichment map of
ACE2 gene was created using g:profiler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost) utility and the

The correlated expression (transcriptomic and proteomic) of ACE2 (to which SARS-CoV-2
binds through the S-spike) was found to be enriched in the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
(highest in small intestine, followed by colon and rectum), and was undetectable in the upper
GIT components: mouth cavity (tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus, and
stomach. High expression of ACE2 was noted in the glandular cells as well as in the
enterocytes in the lining epithelium (including brush border epithelium). Among other
digestive system organs, Gall bladder (GB) showed high expression of ACE2 in glandular
cells, while any protein expression was undetectable in liver and pancreas. TMPRSS2 was
found enhanced in GIT and exocrine glands of pancreas, and co-localized with ACE2 in
enterocytes.

Based on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature we propose
that a SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE2 mediates dysregulation of the sodium dependent
nutrient transporters and hence may be a plausible basis for the digestive symptoms in
COVID-19 patients. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose transporter
(SGLT1 or SLC5A1) in the intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes
mellitus which can be a possible reason for the associated mortality in COVID-19 patients
with diabetes. High expression of ACE2 in mucosal cells of the intestine and GB make these
organs potential sites for the virus entry and replication. Continued replication of the virus at

The world is currently reeling in an alarming outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019
referred to as COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by a new coronavirus strain severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2)—a positive sense single strand RNA
virus. Recent studies which decoded structure of the virus showed binding of its S-spike
protein to a human protein- angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1-3). Following ACE2
binding, cleavage of the viral spike protein (S) by the serine proteases like transmembrane
serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) or Cathepsin L (CTSL) is essential to effectuate host cell
membrane fusion and virus infectivity (4). Clinical presentation in COVID-19 patients is
highly diverse and majority of them primarily presents with pulmonary symptoms (cough,
fever, shortness of breath) (5). In addition, some of the patients present with digestive
symptoms like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain (data ranges from 3.8% to
50.5%) (6). Digestive symptoms have been the only presentations in some of the patients
(8,9). Digestive symptoms are not unique to the COVID-19 and usually present in the
gastroenteritis caused by many other respiratory syndrome viruses like SARS-CoV-1 and
influenza A and B (10,11). However, how SARS-CoV-2 makes entry into the gastrointestinal
(GI) tissue leading to gastroenteritis-like features, does not imbibe sufficient and coherent
explanation in the light of the existing literature. Some investigators have speculated a fecaloral route of transmission based on fecal shedding of viral proteins and infectious virus in
some COVID-19 patients (12,13).

Knowing the expression pattern of ACE2 and one of the proteases, TMPRSS2 in
gastrointestinal tract (GIT) may explicate the pathogenesis of digestive symptoms in COVID19. Digestive juices and enzymes secreted from the liver, gall bladder (GB) and pancreas play
an important role in maintenance of the secretions and absorption of nutrients across
intestinal epithelium. Hence their possible dysfunction in COVID-19 patients needs to be
examined in order to understand pathogenesis of the digestive symptoms which, in turn,
prevent some COVID-19 associated mortality.

Existing literature on the role of ACE2 in regulation of the ion transporters which maintain
secretion/absorption across intestinal epithelium provide a clue that digestive symptoms in
COVID-19 may have an ACE2 based etiogenesis (11,14-16). Investigating the ACE2
expression pattern of digestive system components may also help to explain exacerbated
diabetic complications and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Diabetes has been noted as a comorbidity (16.2%) in COVID-19 and has contributed to increased mortality (22%) (17)
Existing literature implicates ACE2 mediated dysregulation of sodium dependent glucose
transporter (SGLT1 or SLC5A1) at intestinal epithelium in the pathogenesis of the diabetes
mellitus (18,19).

In this study, we aim at examining the plausibility (based on the tissue specific expression of
ACE2) whether any of the digestive system components can be involved in the continued
replication of the SARS-CoV-2 after pulmonary symptoms are relieved. Many incidences of
disease recurrence have been reported in COVID-19 patients even after being discharged
from the hospital. Studies have reported continued shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the feces of
COVID-19 patients up to five weeks after disappearance of the pulmonary symptoms
bolstering the indication that a residual persisting of virus inside the digestive system
components may be a reason for the disease recurrence (20).

As described by the source labs, specimens containing normal tissue were collected and
sampled from anonymized paraffin embedded material of surgical specimens, in accordance
with approval from the local ethics committee. The specimens were derived from surgical
material, normal was defined by morphological parameters and absence of neoplasia. IHC
staining was performed using a standard protocol on normal tissue microarray
(https://www.proteinatlas.org/download/IHC_protocol.pdf). Antibodies against human ACE2
(HPA000288, CAB026174) and TMPRSS2 (HPA035787) were labeled with DAB (3, 3'diaminobenzidine) stain. Protein expression score was done based on the staining intensity
(negative, weak, moderate or strong) and fraction of stained cells (<25%, 25-75% or >75%).
For each protein, the IHC staining profile was matched with mRNA expression data and
gene/protein characterization data to yield an ‘annotated protein expression’ profile.

The Human Protein Atlas collects transcriptomic data from the three databases (HPA, GTEx
and FANTOM5). HPA RNAseq was performed on human tissue samples from healthy
individuals (Accession no: PRJEB4337, Ensembl: ENSG00000130234 (version 92.38). Total
RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted RNA samples were
analyzed using either an Experion automated electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA) with the standard-sensitivity RNA chip or an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
system (Agilent Biotechnologies, Palo Alto, USA) with the RNA 6000 Nano Labchip Kit.
Only samples of high-quality RNA (RNA Integrity Number 7.5) were used for the mRNA
sample preparation for sequencing. mRNA sequencing was performed on Illumina
HiSeq2000 and 2500 machines (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using the standard Illumina
RNA-seq protocol with a read length of 2x100 bases. Transcript abundance estimation was
performed using Kallisto v0.43.1 (https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/about). The normalized
Tags Per Million (TPM) for each gene from the three databases were calculated and included
in the Human Protein Atlas. Each tissue was categorized for the intensity of gene expression
using a cutoff value of 1 NX as a limit for detection across all tissues. A tissue was
categorized (i) enriched if it had NX level at least four times higher than other tissues, (ii) low
specificity if NX ≥ 1 in at least one tissue, (iii) Not detected if NX < 1 in all tissues. Further

The transcriptomic and proteomic expression of ACE2 displayed high enrichment in the
lower GIT (small intestine, colon, and rectum) (Fig. 1, 2e-h, Table 1). It was highest in the
parts of small intestine followed by the colon and the rectum, and nearly absent
(negligible/low mRNA expression and undetectable protein expression) in the upper GIT
components: mouth cavity (including tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus,
and stomach (Fig. 1, 2a-d). GB showed high glandular expression of ACE2, while any
protein expression was undetectable in appendix, liver (hepatocytes and bile duct), and
pancreas (exocrine and endocrine glandular tissue) (though minimal mRNA expression was
noted) (Fig. 3). Intense ACE2 expression was noted in the glandular cells as well as in the
enterocytes in the lining epithelium of the lower GIT (Fig. 2e-h). The cellular expression of
ACE2 was visible in the enterocyte cytoplasm and in the apical brush border (Fig. 2e-h,
marked with arrow heads). The digestive system specific functional enrichment map for
ACE2 gene were related to digestive functions like enzyme activity, amino acids transport,
and peptide metabolism at the brush border membrane of enterocytes in the intestinal
epithelium (Fig. S1, Table S1). TMPRSS2 was found enhanced in GIT and exocrine glands
of pancreas (Fig. S2, Table S2) and found co-localized with ACE2 in enterocytes (Fig. S3).

We found enriched transcriptomic and proteomic expression of SARS-CoV-2 binding
receptor ACE2 in lower GIT (small intestine, colon, and rectum) and GB (Fig. 1-3. Table 1).
The digestive system specific functional enrichment map of the ACE2 gene suggests its role
in regulating secretory/absorptive functions at the brush border membrane of the enterocytes
in the intestinal lining epithelium (Fig.S1, Table S1). The co-localized expression of SARSCoV-2 cell entry associated protease TMPRSS2 in the enterocytes make these cells potential
sites for viral infection (Fig. S2-3, Table S2).

ACE2 is a homologue of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE), the key enzyme of the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It is an integral membrane protein and localizes
predominantly at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells where it is proteolytically
cleaved within its ectodomain to release a soluble form (21,22). Currently, SARS-CoV-2
mediated binding of ACE2 and the following downstream events leading to tissue damage
are little known. Presumptive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 driven pathology is being
borrowed from SARS-CoV-1 which was the etiological basis of SARS pandemic in 2003.
Uniquely, it acted on the same receptor as SARS-CoV-2 and led to many clinical
manifestations similar to COVID-19 (23). Studies utilizing cell lines to decipher SARS
pathology in lung tissue showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-1 (SARS-S) induced
TNFα production which facilitated virus entry (24). TNFα also led to inflammation of the cell
membrane and consequently tissue damage (22-24). SARS-CoV-1 was also showed to cause
downregulation of ACE2 expression at the cell membrane level (22,25). Existing literature
regarding expression of ACE2 in human tissues are rare. Hamming et al, studied ACE2

protein expression in human tissues in reference to SARS-CoV-1 (26). Our findings for
ACE2 protein expression in digestive system components are in line with the findings of their
study (26). Recently, enriched expressions of ACE2 (and TMPRSS2) in enterocytes and
mucus producing cells were shown using single cell m-RNA expression studies (27,28).
Enriched expression of SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 in the mucosal glands and
enterocytes (including brush border cells) in the lining epithelium (Fig. 2e-h, Table 1) of the
lower GIT indicates that GI cells are potential sites for virus replication. Evidence of the viral
shedding in the feces shown in some studies indicates possible replication of the virus inside
the GI cells which, in turn may explain GI manifestations of COVID-19 in addition to disease
recurrence (29,30). Recent in situ studies using recombinant strain of SARS-CoV-2 showed
that the virus can potentially infect and replicate in human intestinal tissue (31,32). Further,
GIT to pulmonary spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been indicated by a study by Sun et
al who showed in a transgenic mouse expressing human ACE2 that a direct intragastric
inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 can cause productive infection and lead to pulmonary
pathological changes (33).

How the virus reaches the GI is arguable? Some authors speculated a fecal-oral route of entry
(8). Shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in feces was also detected in occasional COVID-19
patients (12,13). We examined possibility of this route of entry based on the expression
pattern of ACE2 along the length of the GIT (Fig. 1, 2, Table 1). Negligible or very low
mRNA expression and undetectable proteomic expression of ACE2 in the mouth cavity
(including tongue, oral mucosa, and salivary glands), esophagus, and stomach (Fig. 1, 2a-d,
Table 1) indicate these parts of GIT can be resistant for the virus entry. But this observation
does not negate a possible site of virus entry through the ACE2 receptors present in the lower
GIT in case of fecal-oral transmission. It is then intriguing that how SARS-CoV-2 survives
extremes of pH within the digestive system milieu (gastric-1.5 to 3.5, pancreatic-7.5, bile
acid-7-8) while passing along the length of GIT. Recently, Chin et al., 2020 showed in vitro
that SARS-CoV-2 can survive at wide range of pH values at room temperature (pH3-10)
(34). This can be further explained by an earlier study by Hirose et al, who, in an
experimental, model demonstrated that RNA viruses like influenza A and B (when
swallowed) can survive extremes of pH and maintain infectivity with help of the mucus cover
lining GIT allowing their safe passage and even excretion in feces (35). Mucus cells are
abundant all along the length of the GIT which can contribute to the carriage and survival of
SARS-CoV-2 thereby contributing to the so hypothesized fecal-oral transmission. This also
hints that shedding of the virus in feces always may not be indicative of its replication in GI
cells; all those patients who shed virus in stools don’t necessarily present with digestive
symptoms (29).

Healthy intestinal mucosa may not be well conducive for the entry of the virus due to the
presence of unique multi-layer barrier system, though a prior inflammatory condition which
disrupts mucosal barrier may render the lower GI entry of the SARS-CoV-2 using ACE2
receptor and its replication inside tissue plausible (36). Inflammatory conditions in GIT
enhance the expression of ACE2 in the luminal epithelium which can provide additional
support for the entry of the virus (37). Once inside the GI cells, the virus can replicate there
and may orchestrate viral toxin mediated cell injury ensuing further inflammation, thereby,
giving rise to gastroenteritis like symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, abdominal pain)
(22,24,38). Other than the fecal-oral route, an alternative route of viral entry to the GI cells
may be through the tissue microvasculature. Though this may not be highly probable but this
premise does warrant consideration. In that case, fecal viral shedding can happen after
sloughing of the inflamed/necrosed intestinal mucosa. Currently, data is limited which

ACE2 is known to regulate sodium-dependent amino acid and glucose transporters in the
enterocytes brush border which physiologically engage in the absorption of nutrients from the
digested food, and maintain osmotic and electrolyte balance across the GI lining epithelium
(11,14). In a recent study Yan et al., 2020 showed that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the complex
of ACE2 with B0AT1(Slc6a19)—a major sodium dependent neutral amino acid transporter
present in the epithelial lining of human intestine (and also in kidneys) (1,42). The
dysregulation of the intestinal ion transporters has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
infectious diarrhea and malabsorption disorders (15,16). Literature also suggests that a
dysregulation of these transporters can ensue interleukin/cytokine mediated intestinal
inflammation and can give rise to digestive symptoms (14). An enhanced GI expression of
ACE2 is known in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) which present with similar symptoms
as in COVID-19 patients (14,43).

Based on the findings of this study and supportive evidence from the literature, we propose
that a virus binding-ACE2 mediated dysregulation of the sodium dependent nutrient
transporters may be a plausible basis for the digestive symptoms in COVID-19. Prior
intestinal inflammatory conditions like IBD may raise the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2
infection through fecal-oral transmission. ACE2 mediated dysregulation of SGLT1 and/or
SLC5A1 at intestinal epithelium also links it to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (18,19).
The SGLT1 transporters are physiologically involved in active absorption of glucose across
the intestinal epithelium and its virus binding receptor ACE2 mediated dysregulation may
exacerbate the existing impaired glycemic control in COVID-19 patients with diabetes
mellitus (19). (Sufficient data on glycemic control in COVID-19 patients is lacking for now,
impaired glycemic control was stated as an independent risk factor predicting morbidity and
mortality in SARS patients with diabetes mellitus (44).) ACE2 mediated downregulation of
SGLT1 in intestinal epithelium prevents hyperglycemia in rat models of the diabetes mellitus
(45,46). Though direct evidence is lacking in terms of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 binding on
ACE2 on its signaling cascades, however, substantiation from SARS-CoV-1 studies (for
SARS) suggests that it can downregulate ACE2 expression (25). Such an eventuality can lead
to upregulation of SGLT1 thereby precipitating hyperglycemia (45,46). (SGLT1 inhibitors
are being used in treatment of diabetes mellitus, their use in COVID-19 patients may need a
rethinking for the dose adjustments (47).)

Our data showed undetectable expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in insulin
producing Islets of Langerhans of the pancreas raising an insulin independent possibility of
dysregulated intestinal SGLT1 transporters. This bolsters the rationale behind diabetes related
increased morbidity/mortality in COVID-19 patients. Apart from intestine SGLT1 is known
to be widely expressed in other human tissues like proximal tubule of kidney, heart, and liver
(proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000100170-SLC5A1/tissue) where it regulates the glucose
absorption. An ACE2-mediated dysregulation of SGLT1 in COVID-19 patients warrants
further investigation.

High expression of ACE2 in glandular cells of the GB indicates that this also can be a
potential site for the virus replication. (Contrastingly, we found low m-RNA and undetectable
proteomic expression of TMPRSS2 in glandular cells of GB, however, robust expression of
another serine protease CTSL is noted in these cells in the records of Human Protein Atlas
(48), which may be able to substitute for TMPRSS2 (1)) GB has a luminal connection to the
duodenum through cystic and common bile duct (CBD). Though this connection is guarded

by a sphincter (of Oddi) present in duodenal mucosa, it doesn’t create an anatomical barrier
and, therefore, a viral invasion along the mucosal epithelium remains a possibility.

GB is the physiological storage site for the bile secreted from the hepatocytes, and pathology
of this organ can also contribute to the digestive symptoms present in COVID-19 patients.
GB has been a known reservoir for Salmonella typhi, a bacterium causing enteric fever, and
one of the cited reasons for disease recurrence (49). The thick mucin secreted from its
glandular cells can provide a protective environment for survival of SARS-CoV-2 (as we
discussed above for GI lining epithelium) (35). Hence, GB homing may act as a mechanism
for the replication of the virus even without ensuing a local tissue injury.

337
338
339
340

Continued replication of the SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal tissue, and possibly in GB, may be
a potential reason for the recurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in the light of the diagnostic tests as has
been noted in some COVID-19 patients after being discharged from the hospital (40,50). A
post-mortem study of these organs in COVID-19 patients may provide some confirmation in
this regard.

341
342
343
344

Based on the observed pattern of tissue specific expression of ACE2 (which binds to SARSCoV-2) in the components of the digestive system in normal individuals, we propose that an
ACE2 based mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of digestive symptoms,
increased diabetes-associated mortality risk, and disease recurrence in COVID-19.

Limitations

349
350

All the aspects of the plausible SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 mediated pathology in
the digestive system which we have discussed above are based on the distribution of the virus
cell entry related factors in the normal tissue. Hence, this study presents indirect evidence
which needs to be validated in actual patients before reaching any conclusion.

Future directions

357
358
359

Further studies are advisable to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the SARSCoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 mediated dysregulation of the intestinal nutrient transporters
and finding out COVID-19 specific drug targets. Inter-individual variations in frequency of
the digestive symptoms, diabetes associated mortality, and recurrences may depend upon the
genotype specific variations in ACE2 expression and other patient specific characteristics
(like age, sex, and comorbidity). A study of these variables in the disease pathogenesis may
help in deciding personalized therapeutic management for the COVID-19 cases.
