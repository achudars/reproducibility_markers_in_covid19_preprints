Keywords: SARS-CoV-2; Transcriptomics; Gene ontology; Pathway analysis; Inflammatory
response

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease
(COVID-19) at the end of 2019 has caused a large global outbreak and now become a major
public health issue. Lack of data underlying how the human host interacts with SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In the current study, We performed Venn-analysis, Gene ontology (GO), KEGG pathway analysis
and Protein-protein interaction analysis of whole transcriptome studies with the aim of clarifying
the genes and pathways potentially altered during human respiratory tract cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2. We selected four studies through a systematic search of the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database or published article about SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of
respiratory tract cells. We found 36 overlapping upregulated genes among different types of cells
after viral infection. Further functional enrichment analysis revealed these DEGs are most likely
involved in biological processes related to inflammatory response and response to cytokine, cell
component related to extracellular space and I-kappaB/NF-kappaB complex, molecular function
related to protein binding and cytokine activity. KEGG pathways analysis highlighted altered
conical and casual pathways related to TNF, NF-kappa B, Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
and IL17 signaling pathways during SARS-CoV-2 infection with CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3,
CXCL8, CXCL10, IL32, CX3CL1, CCL20, IRF1, NFKB2 and NFKB1A up-regulated which may
explain the inflammatory cytokine storms associated with severe cases of COVID-19.

The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported at the
end of 2019 [1,2]. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever,
cough, dyspnea, pneumonia [3-6], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even multiple
organ dysfunction in severe cases [7]. Clinical characteristic varied in different COVID-19
patients, and a number of patients showed asymptomatic infection [8-10] Recent studies have
revealed that asymptomatic cases could also transmit the virus to contacts around them, which
makes it more difficult to control the spread of the virus [11].
Several anti-viral drugs have been used to target the SARS-CoV-2 infection. These drugs
include lopinavir/ritonavir, penciclovir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, ribavirin
[12]. However, most of drugs have limited efficacy to reduce the severity of COVID-19 patients.
In addition, some of them have serious side effects [13,14]. The shortcomings of current tested
drugs lead scientists and physicians continuously looking up the better remedies for treatment of
COVID-19. Transcriptional profiling has provided remarkable opportunities for understanding the
relationship between cellular function and metabolic pathways, as well as to define the possible
implications of genetic variability and environmental conditions in many tissues and organisms
after viral infection [15,16], which could contribute to the screening of drug targets against viruses.
In bioinformatics, RNA-Seq analyses are challenging due to its complexity and voluminosity.
However, many computational methods and techniques have been developed for the use of the
analysis of transcriptomics data. In addition, network-based approach is also extensively used to
analyze and identify the potential candidate genes after viral infection [17].
The clinical picture of COVID-19 patients are characterized by an over-exuberant immune
response with lung lymphomononuclear cells infilteration and proliferation that may account for
tissue damage more than the direct effect of viral replication [18-20]. Evidence also showed that
SARS-CoV-2 infects human respiratory tract cells, prompting inflammation and tissue
damage/loss as well as in other different cell types [21]. Despite recent advances, little is known
about the pathways involved in viral pathogenesis [22]. In the present study, we performed an
analysis of several transcriptome studies, aiming to clarify which genes and cellular networks
were up- or down-regulated during SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells. Moreover, we
assessed a comprehensive GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis to predict how the
modulation of these genes could affect the outcome of the disease.

Study Search and RNA-Seq data collection
We searched for RNA-Seq experiments deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database and NCBI Pubmed related to SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of human
respiratory tract cells (Calu-3, doi:10.3390/biology9090260; ACE2-A549,GSE154613; a lung
organoid model driving by human pluripotent stem cells, GSE155241; Primary human bronchial
epithelial cells, GSE150819) which carried out in human cells (ex vivo) or human cell lines (in
vitro). Genes with fold change>1.3 or <0.77 and p-values <0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.

were performed using OmicsBean (http://www.omicsbean.cn) and Cytoscape v. 3.1.0 software
(http://www.cytoscape.org/) [23] as a complementary and more comprehensive approach for
identifying the central hub genes.

To highlight the changes in cellular host genes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and further
explore the mechanism of viral infection and pathogenesis, we searched the electronic databases
(GEO databases or Pubmed) to identify the related studies. We included 4 studies in our
qualitative study, they are all about transcriptome profiling of human respiratory tract cells (Calu-3,
doi:10.3390/biology9090260; ACE2-A549, GSE154613; Lung organoid model driving by human
pluripotent stem cells, GSE155241; Primary human bronchial epithelial cells, GSE150819).
Using Venn diagram analysis for the groups’ data, the following was found: there were 36
overlapping up-regulated and 0 overlapping down-regulated mRNAs among the four infection
groups. (Figure 1A,B). We further performed a functional enrichment analysis using the 36 all
up-regulated genes, and results revealed 2,506, 164, 226, and 102 terms associated with biological
processes (BPs) , cell components (CCs), molecular functions (MFs), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes pathways (KEGG), in which, 1,907, 78, 98, 39 terms was significantly
enriched, respectively (Figure 2 A), top 10 enriched terms of BPs, CCs, MFs were presented in
detail (Figure 2 B).

The 1,907 different biological process GO terms were further analyzed using OmicsBean software.
According to the different levels of the GO terms (Figure 3A, C), most differential genes were
related to positive regulation of immune system process, regulation of immune system process and
positive regulation of response to stimulus (level 3 GO), and continued subdivision of the grades
showed that the differential genes were involved in the defense response, response to cytokine,
cytokine-mediated signaling pathways (level 3-7 GO). According to the number of enriched genes
(Figure 3B), they mainly enriched in signal transduction (29 differential genes), defense response
(24 differential genes), regulation of cell communication (24 differential genes), response to
organic substance (23 differential genes), multicellular organism development (22 differential
genes) and cellular response to chemical stimulus (20 differential genes). A sorting of the different
GO terms based on the P-value and gene number (Figure 3 C,D,E) revealed that these
up-regulated genes are most likely involved in biological processes related to inflammatory
response and response to cytokine, which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause a
strong host immune response.

continued subdivision identified extracellular region part, membrane-enclosed lumen (level 2 GO)
and organelle lumen (level 3 GO), cytoplasm, cytoplasmic part and cytosol (level 4-6 GO).
According to the number of enriched genes (Figures 4 B), the most abundantly enriched
up-regulated genes were associated with cytoplasm (27 genes), intracellular organelle (22 genes),
intracellular organelle part (20 genes) and vesicle (9 genes). By distinguishing the difference in the
P-value of the GO terms and gene number (Figure 4 C,D), we found that these up-regulated genes
were enriched in extracellular space and I-kappaB/NF-kappaB complex of cell components.

The analysis of the 98 different molecular functions according to the number of the different GO
classification levels (Figure 5A), the genes showing the highest differential expression are
associated with protein binding (level 3 GO), and further subdivisions showed that the
up-regulated genes are associated with receptor binding, cytokine receptor binding, G-protein
coupled receptor binding, chemokine receptor binding and CXCR chemokine receptor binding
(level 4-7 of GOs). In terms of the number of enriched genes (Figures 5 B) revealed that the most
abundant up-regulated genes were enriched in receptor binding (12 genes), identical protein
binding (10 genes) and enzyme binding (6 genes). Sorting the different GO terms based on
ascending P-values and gene number (Figure 5 C,D) revealed that the genes showing the greatest
differential expression are likely enriched in the molecular functions of the protein binding and
cytokine activity.
Based on the above results, it can be hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could activate
the immune response in human respiratory tract cells. A statistical analysis of immune regulation
GO terms and pathways (Supplemental Table 1-4) showed that many up-regulated genes are
involved in.

Through a KEGG pathway cluster analysis, we further found that the up-regulated genes mainly
regulated the TNF signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Viral protein
interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor and IL17 signaling pathway (Figure 6 A). Sorting
the different KEGG pathways based on ascending P-values and gene number (Figure 6 B,C)
revealed that the up-regulated genes mainly enriched in TNF signaling pathway, NF-kappa B
signaling pathway and IL17 signaling pathway.
A protein-protein interaction analysis (Figure 6 D) were also explored. The results showed that
the key genes regulating these processes are CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL10, IL32,
CX3CL1, CCL20, IRF1, NFKB2 and NFKB1A, NFKB1E and their certain interaction
relationship was also shown. Furthermore, an analysis of the most significant IL17 signaling
pathway in KEGG (Figure 6 E) revealed that the TNFAIP3, NFKBIA (upstream) gene in the
pathway and the CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL8. CXCL10, CCL20 and PTGS2, (downstream) genes in
the pathway, play an important role in immunity of host cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
addition, the details of NF-KAPPA B and TNF signaling pathway activated by SARS-CoV-2
infection were also shown in Figure S1-2. This finding is consistent with the results of the GO
analysis, which showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly activated the ability of respiratory
tract cells to respond to the invasion of extracellular pathogens.

As of 13 Oct 2020, a total of 37,423,660 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 1,074,817 deaths had
been reported [24], the case numbers are still increasing rapidly due to the second wave of
epidemics worldwide. The underlying biological processes and mechanisms impacted by this viral
infection of the host is still not clear. Analyzing the gene expression profiles of host cells infected
with SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to decipher the subcellular functions perturbed by this virus
and to inform drug development strategies.
RNA-Seq has contributed to increase the knowledge relative to the biological and cellular
processes involved during viral infection, especially in the context of an emergent pathogen
[16,17], such as SARS-CoV-2. Venn analysis of several RNA-Seq assays increases the statistical
power of samples and we applied this method for re-examining past evidence to better understand
the pathogenesis of infections. In our current study, we explored recent SARS-CoV-2 infected
cell-derived transcriptome datasets to dissect the cellular and molecular changes in response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. We finally included four available studies and analyzed the gene
expression patterns using Venn analysis (Figure 1).
The RNA-Seq results of respiratory tract cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed that the
up-regulated genes identified from the comparison of two groups such as CXCL1, CXCL2,
CXCL3, CXCL8, CXCL10, IL32, CX3CL1, CCL20, IRF1, NFKB2 and NFKB1A, NFKB1E are
involved in the regulation of TNF signaling pathway, NF-kappaB signaling pathway and IL17
signaling pathway. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was first described as a glycoprotein induced in
response to endotoxin and has the capacity to kill tumor cells [25]. Then, TNF was shown to be a
T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine produced by several cell types, and to be involved in
pro-inflammatory responses like interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 [26]. In concert with chemokines,
TNF signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of inflammatory processes of infectious
diseases including HIV (Human immunodeficiency virus), JEV (Japanese encephalitis virus),
WNV (West Nile virus) and USUV (Ustuuvirus) infection [27-30]. The nuclear factor NF-kB
pathway has also long been considered a prototypical pro-inflammatory signaling pathway, largely
based on the role of NF-kB signaling pathway in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes
including cytokines and chemokines [31]. Therefore, NF-κB has been considered as a target for
new anti-inflammatory drugs for a long time. In our study, we found SARS-CoV-2 infection could
activate NF-kB signaling pathway and up-regulate some pro-inflammatory genes, we further
speculate drugs targeting the NF-kB signaling pathway may be one of the candidate drugs for the
treatment severe COVID-19 patients.
It is worth mentioning that, IRF1 in respiratory tract cells was up-regulated by SARS-CoV-2
infection. IRF1 is a member of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family that plays an important role
in immunomodulatory. IRF1 prominently participates in antiviral defense by regulating early
expression of IFNs [32]. What’s more, as a transcription factor, IRF1 regulates constitutive
expression of other antiviral genes by binding to their promoter directly. Studies revealed that
IRF1 deficient mice are more susceptible to RNA viruses infections [33-37]. Thus, we think IRF1
may play a critical role in regulating constitutive antiviral gene networks to confer resistance
against SARS-CoV-2 infections in human respiratory epithelial cells.
Inflammation is the first line of defense against tissue damage caused viral infection, involving
activating both the innate and adaptive immune responses [38]. However, exuberant immune
responses after viral infection, which also called cytokine storm, has been found to be associated

with excessive levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and also some tissue damage [39]. Cytokine
storm has been proved to exist after several influenza viruses infection [40,41], as well as
coronavirues [42-44], and contributes to acute lung injury or ARDS. Preliminary studies have
revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection could also trigger cytokine storm in severe cases,
accompanied by an increase of various cytokines [45]. In the current study, we found that several
cytokine related genes were upregulated after SARS-CoV-2 infection which could provide
explanation about the cytokine storms associated with severe COVID-19 cases.

Our results highlighted activation of TNF, NF-kappa B, Cytokine-cytokine interaction, IL17
signaling pathway and other inflammatory response as the main hallmark associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of human respiratory epithelial cells in vitro, further
identified several differential expressed genes during the course of infection such as IRF1,
CXCL1-3, IL32, CXCL10, CX3CL1, CCL20, NFKB2 and so on, which may serve as COVID-19
biomarkers. Interferon and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection might provide
explanation to cytokine storms associated with severe COVID-19 cases. However, precise
mechanism in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 remains to be further investigated.
