Abstract
In the last months, many studies have clearly described several mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection at cell
and tissue level. Host conditions and comorbidities were identified as risk factors for severe and fatal disease
courses, but the mechanisms of interaction between host and SARS-CoV-2 determining the grade of COVID19 severity, are still unknown.
We provide a network analysis on protein–protein interactions (PPI) between viral and host proteins to better
identify host biological responses, induced by both whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2 and specific viral
proteins. A host-virus interactome was inferred on published PPI, using an explorative algorithm (Random
Walk with Restart) triggered by all the 28 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, or each single viral protein one-by-one.
The functional analysis for all proteins, linked to many aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis, allows to identify
the subcellular districts, where SARS-CoV-2 proteins seem to be distributed, while in each interactome built
around one single viral protein, a different response was described, underlining as ORF8 and ORF3a modulated
cardiovascular diseases and pro-inflammatory pathways, respectively. Finally, an explorative network-based
approach was applied to Bradykinin Storm, highlighting a possible direct action of ORF3a and NS7b to
enhancing this condition.
This network-based model for SARS-CoV-2 infection could be a framework for pathogenic evaluation of
specific clinical outcomes. We identified possible host responses induced by specific proteins of SARS-CoV2, underlining the important role of specific viral accessory proteins in pathogenic phenotypes of severe
COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Whilst COVID-19 predominantly affects the respiratory system, it is a multisystem disease, with a wide
spectrum of clinical presentations from asymptomatic, mild and moderate, to severe, fulminant disease (1).
Host conditions and comorbidities such as high age, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, organ damages,
inflammation and coagulation dysfunctionality, were identified as risk factors for severe and fatal disease
courses(2), but the mechanisms of interaction between host and SARS-CoV-2 that activate pathological
pathways and determine severity, are still unknown.
In last months, many studies clearly described several mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection at cell and tissue
level. It was observed that the replication of SARS-CoV-2, as well as all +RNA viruses, occurs in the
cytoplasm of the host cell, inducing a membrane rearrangement of rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membranes into double-membrane vesicles (3, 4). Moreover, NSP8 along with NSP7 and NSP12, which yield
the RNA polymerase activity of NSP8, are assembled into the replicase–transcriptase complex, that begins to
generate anti-sense (-) genomic RNA molecules, templates for positive-sense genome (+) and mRNA
transcripts (5, 6). During virus entry, a well-known process is the cleavage of S protein by Furin on the cell
membrane, which lead to split S protein into two subunits, S1 and S2, which the last can interact with ACE2
(7, 8). However, the SARS-CoV-2-host interaction is not restricted to local infection, but it triggers a systemic
reaction, including the activation of the Bradykinin Storm, as described in many severe COVID-19 patients
(9). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes from one side a decrease of ACE level in the lung cells and, on the
other side, an increase of ACE2 level, leading to increase Bradykinin level (9). Furthermore, microvascular
injuries, due to systemic inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction, were frequently found in severe
COVID-19 patients (10). Increased circulating D-dimer concentrations, reflecting pulmonary vascular bed
thrombosis with fibrinolysis, and elevated cardiac enzyme concentrations, linked to emergent ventricular stress
induced by pulmonary hypertension, were associated to early features of severe pulmonary intravascular
coagulopathy related to COVID-19 (11). Moreover, myocardial injuries were found to be linked to the risk of
fatal outcome in COVID-19 patients (12-14). In 43% severe patients (21% of all COVID-19 patients) the
myocardial injury was observed and a severe patient had a 4.74-fold increase in the risk of myocardial injury
than non-severe patients (15). Although microvascular injuries and microthrombi formation frequently

occurred in severe COVID-19 patients, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in this phenotype is not completely explained
yet.
Recently, results of a meta-analysis study on interleukin-6 concentrations in patients with severe or critical
COVID-19, pointed out that the systemic inflammatory profile of COVID-19 is distinct from that of nonCOVID-19 ARDS, sepsis, and CAR T cell-induced cytokine release syndrome, and it might be involved in
organ dysfunction in COVID-19, such as endovasculitis, direct viral injury and viral-induced
immunosuppression (16).
Although many aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis and mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated,
only few papers describe the interactions among SARS-CoV-2 proteins by wet experiments. Physical
associations in human cells, between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins, were found by affinitypurification mass spectrometry (AP-MS), identifying 332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human proteinprotein interactions (PPIs), highlighting an activation of innate immune pathways (17). Then, the influence of
SARS-CoV-2 on transcriptome, proteome, ubiquitinome and phosphoproteome of a lung-derived human cell
line, was described through a multi-omic approach. Such a multilevel representation highlighted autophagy
mechanisms regulation by ORF3a and nsp6, the modulation of innate immunity by M, ORF3a and NS7b, and
the Integrin-TGF-β-EGFR-RTK signalling perturbation by ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 (18).
Virus–host interactome by computational approach has been applied to COVID-19 for drug repurposing (17),
allowing the identification of new drug targets (19) and contributing to explain clinical manifestations (20,
21). The structural information on SARS-CoV-2 proteins and their interactions with human proteins and other
viral proteins, allowed to better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, also comparing it with
SARS-CoV (22).
One of the most interesting models of SARS-CoV-2 – host interactions was carried out on Spike-receptor
interactions in other Human Coronaviruses (H-CoV). This network-based analysis of H-CoV - host interaction
has provided a theoretic model for H-CoV infections applicable to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, revealing
biologically and clinically relevant molecular targets of three H-CoV infections (23).

The interactome based on PPI and gene expression data, have been applied also to uncover the molecular
origins of phenotypes of other complex diseases (24, 25), in order to better define the mechanisms of COVID19 pathogenesis.
The understanding of all mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection also passes by overall visualization of
biological reactions and pathways involved in COVID-19 and H-CoV infections. It can carry out on a disease
map, such as COVID-19 Disease Maps, containing many diagrams about host molecular response during the
infection (26-28).
In this context, defining the host response induced by specific viral proteins would be of great importance and
can guide the identification of functional viral targets, helping to better define the pathologic phenotypes of
the infection.
Here, we carry out a network analysis on PPI to better identify host biological response induced by SARSCoV-2. Furthermore, the interactome analysis was applied to design network of SARS-CoV-2 - host proteins
that could lead to a Bradykinin Storm. We used three different applications to identify interacting proteins:
200 proteins that interact closely with 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, 50 protein interactomes around each SARSCoV-2 protein and 200 protein associated with KNG1, the pre-cursor of Bradykinin (BK).
In all three models, pathways associated with proteins were identified, including DNA damage/repair, TGF-β
signalling, complement cascades (Figure 1).

Results
Interactions with whole proteome of SARS-CoV-2
To define the massive effect of SARS-COV-2 infection on the host cell, an interactome between the entire set
of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and host was carried out. Observing the colours’ distribution, it is possible to
distinguish three different areas, corresponding to as many subcellular districts, where SARS-CoV-2 proteins
seem to be distributed (Figure 2 a). In fact, N, nsp1, nsp4 and nsp15 are posed around nuclear proteins, while
S, along with nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14, nsp16, ORF1a and ORF9b, were among cytosolic and
membrane proteins, at the bounder of the interactome. Protein M and many accessory and not-structural
proteins (NS7b, nsp6, nsp7, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8, ORF10 and ORF14) are around mitochondrial and
endoplasmic proteins.

We described the high values of betweenness centrality and degree for 9 host proteins: two proteins Multiorganelle Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) and dual-specificity protein phosphatase (PTEN); the
membrane protein Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 (ATP1A1); two cytoplasmic
proteins, 14-3-3 protein theta (YWHAQ) and Ubiquitin (UBC); two proteins of endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi apparatus, Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (ATP2A2) and Unconventional
myosin-VI (MYO6); the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit alpha (ATP5F1A); one nuclear receptor for
export of RNAs, Exportin-1 (XPO1), suggesting their main role in this infection (S-Figure 1, S-Table 1). In
order to further dissect the interactions with the entire proteome of SARS-CoV-2, enrichment analysis was
carried out with WikiPathways and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.
WikiPathways gene enrichment analysis revealed biological pathways of DNA replication, ubiquitination and
proteasome, with high significance (FDR <0.01%). In addition, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed
DNA and RNA replication pathways as the most significant pathways (FDR <0.01%), as well as signalling
pathways and viral infection pathways (Figure 2 b).

Host response induced by specific protein of SARS-CoV-2
To define the effect of specific viral proteins on host response, interactomes were built, choosing one specific
viral protein as seed, imposing to find the 50 closest proteins. These analyses allowed to produce 28 restricted
interactomes, which defined the strictest biological interactions associated to seed proteins both among human
proteins and other viral proteins. In S- Figure 2 the interactomes for structural proteins were reported, while in
S- Figures 3 and 4 the interactomes for accessory and non-structural proteins were plotted.
Most of the interactomes have few viral proteins into the reconstruct PPI network (i.e. M, nsp1, and ORF3a),
while into other interactomes the viral seed protein shared own human target proteins with other viral proteins
or interacts directly with other viral proteins, such as nsp3, nsp10, ORF6 and ORF10.
The lists of proteins for each reduced interactome were submitted to gene enrichment analysis on
WikiPathways and KEGG pathway databases (S-table 2 and 3, respectively). For each single viral protein
interactome, the top 5% with the smallest p values of gene enrichment analysis was selected, reporting for
KEGG and WikiPathways in Figure 3 a and b, respectively.

For KEGG database the gene enrichment analysis on interactomes of NS7b, ORF1a, ORF3a and ORF8 showed
pathway clusters highly significant and consistent with possible pathogenic mechanisms, such as the activation
of the complement and of the coagulative cascade, (29) and the TGF-β-dominated immune response (30). In
particular, the NS7b interactome revealed SNARE interactions in vesicular transport pathway, describing the
mechanisms of intracellular vesicle trafficking and secretion, as the most significant pathway among all
interactome (FDR< 0. 00001%). The ORF1a interactome revealed a cluster of pathways, composed by
Adherents junction, Bacteria host infection mechanisms, Regulation of actin cytoskeleton and phagocytosis,
all showing the direct involvement of this accessory proteins in viral entry in host cells (FDR < 0. 001%). The
ORF8 interactome showed a pathway cluster involving complement and coagulation cascades and
cardiovascular pathology (FDR < 0.3%). The ORF3a interactome revealed the TGF-β and Cytokine signalling,
endocytosis and Vasopressin-regulation pathways (FDR < 0.01%). From pathway point of view, Proteasome
pathway was involved in interactome of M protein as well as for ORF7a, ORF8 (FDR < 0.05%) (Figure 3a).
For WikiPathways database the gene enrichment analysis showed results consistent with KEGG gene
enrichment for ORF1a, ORF3a and ORF8, and added new pathway cluster for nsp1 (FDR< 0.00001%) with
DNA replication and modification pathways (Figure 3b).

Computational investigation on Bradykinin Storm in COVID-19
As the virus-host interactome has been efficient to describe the response to specific viral proteins, this method
was applied to reconstruct the possible involvement of SARS-COV-2 proteins in triggering the Bradykinin
Storm during the infection. In this case, Kininogen-1 (KNG1), precursor of bradykinin made by proteolysis
cleavage, was considered as seed for RWR, imposing 200 closest proteins as limit to stop the algorithm. The
resulting interactome showed NS7b, ORF3a, ORF8 and S as proximal to the seed protein, suggesting their role
in the modulation of biological processes around Kininogen-1. Indeed, it would provide a direct influence of
NS7b and ORF3a proteins to activation of BK. In fact, both NS7b and ORF3a interact with the same target,
Endothelin Converter Enzyme (ECE1), and cell surface endopeptidase that converts big endothelin-1 to
pressure peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) and inactivates BK (Figure 4a). The enrichment analysis on
WikiPathways and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases revealed biological
pathways of Complement and coagulation cascades (FDR <0.000001%). Finally, to quantify the direct effect

of S, ORF8, ORF3a, NS7b on Complement and coagulation cascades pathways, all proteins belonged to the
most significantly enriched pathways, were highlighted on the interactome: Human Complement System
WP2806 for WikiPathways (22 of 97 genes; adj P value 2.9E-21) and Complement and coagulation cascades
for KEGG (24 of 79 genes; adj P value 5.96E-27). ORF8 showed the direct interactions with Fibrinogen alpha
chain (FGA), described in both pathways, and Urokinase-type Plasminogen Activator (PLAU), Tissue-type
Plasminogen Activator (PLAT) and Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1).

Discussion
In this study, we built a functional interactome between SARS-CoV-2 and human proteome through RWR
algorithm, to identify biological mechanisms and cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and to propose
a simulated model of infection contributing to a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.
SARS-CoV-2 – host interactome allowed to mirror likely mechanisms of infections in different subcellular
districts.
The high likelihood of our model to in vivo real mechanisms strengths the representative power of the
interactome and the explorative algorithm to simulate biological processes.
Moreover, the proximity among specific viral proteins into the network, such as nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10,
nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 involved in the viral RNA replication, can be a good way to investigate their possible
function in viral infection. The closeness among S, nsp5, nsp16, ORF9b in the network is difficult to interpret,
but S, nsp5 and ORF9b, along with N, had significant positive responses of IgG antibody in sera of COVID19 patients (31). In SARS-CoV infected cell culture, the location of nsp2 in the cytoplasm and to some extent
in the nucleus, as well as ORF3a, ORF7b, ORF6 and M in ER, seems to be consistent with their location among
nuclear and cytoplasmatic, and ER proteins respectively (32).
The involvement of proteasome and ubiquitination pathways, along with RNA replication, represent the
principal pathways activated for assembly and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (18). In fact, strong increases in
RNA-modifying proteins were revealed in cell culture after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (33). The ubiquitin
proteasome system deletes viral proteins to control the infection, but the virus can use them for its propagation
(34).

The interactomes, built around a single protein of SARS-CoV-2, allowed to draw effects on cell, involving
specific pathways. Vesicular transport mechanism by SNARE interactions, identified for NS7b, is used by
pathogens to penetrate host cells through their membranes and in particular in SARS-CoV (35, 36).
The pathways showed in ORF3a and ORF8 interactomes suggested a possible modulation of coagulation
cascade and cardiovascular pathology in COVID-19 and the involvement in Cytokine storm and water
homeostasis in endothelial tissue, respectively.
Binding of ORF3a and ORF8 to TGF-β-associated factors (TGFB1, TGFB2, LTBP1, TGFBR2, FURIN,
BAMBI) supports a strong involvement to begging pro-inflammation state, while the direct interactions
between ORF8 and components of Coagulation pathway, such as FGB, FGA, C5, PLAU, PROS1, SERPINE1,
PLAT and CLU (17, 18) suggest a modulation of coagulation cascade by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the biological function of the ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear, the role of ORF8 in
severe COVID-19 outcome might be supported by SARS-CoV-2 variant with a 382-nucleotide deletion (Δ382)
found in Singapore in January-February 2020 linked to mild forms of COVID-19. This deletion truncates open
reading frame 7b and locks ORF8 transcription and would be associated to less cytokine releasing during the
acute phase of infection (37, 38).
The systemic inflammatory response and the relied endothelial dysfunction might be responsible for the
microvascular injuries resulting in the formation of microthrombi, as well as a featuring microvascular
thrombosis and hemorrhage pathology, viewed in lung of COVID-19 patients (11). The main pathways
described in ORF3a and ORF8 interactomes, are consistent with the microvascular injuries and the
development of cardiovascular complications i. e. heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis and cardiac
arrhythmias observed in COVID-19 patients(39). Such featuring symptoms, suggest specific mechanisms of
host-virus interactions, and reinforce the role of ORF3a and ORF8 in the COVID-19 pathogenesis.
To study the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in systemic context, Bradykinin Storm was investigated by the
interactome approach. We showed NS7b and ORF3a interacting with ECE1, which can inactivate BK (40).
Such observation suggests specific mechanisms of host-virus interactions, occurring in severe COVID-19
patients and reinforce the role of ORF3a to enhance the bradykinin dysregulation.

These host-virus interactions could enhance a better viral fitness during the infection, as suggested by the
interaction already observed with SARS-CoV between NS7b in ECE1(18).
This interaction system might suggest a hypothesis that can explain the possible enhancing effect on
Bradykinin Storm in COVID-19: the locking of ECE1 activity due to NS7b and especially ORF3a interaction,
could reduce the activation of the vasoconstrictor endotelin-1, and amplify the vasodilatation effect of BK.
The ECE1 gene is much more expressed in all the tissues than ACE2 and ACE, especially in the lungs, where
ECE1 is 128 fold and 3.8 fold expressed compared to ACE2 and ACE, respectively (41).
Similar to the angiotensin peptides, BK is produced from an inactive pre-protein Kininogen-1 through the
activation by the serine protease kallikrein (42). Furthermore, the excess of BK can lead to vasodilatation,
hypotension and hypokalaemia (9, 43), which is associated with arrhythmia (44, 45). All these clinical
conditions have been widely reported in COVID-19 patients (14, 46, 47). It is also notable that many of the
other symptoms reported for COVID-19 (myalgia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headaches,
decreased cognitive function) are remarkably similar to other hyper-BK-conditions that lead to vascular
hyperpermeabilization (48). Moreover, the activation of BK is strongly linked to coagulation: active F12
activates plasma kallikrein (PK), that liberates bradykinin by cleavage (49). The direct interactions between
ORF8 and two plasminogen activators, PLAU and PLAT, and Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, SERPINE1,
bulk proteins of Plasminogen Activator System and involved in lung injuries and neuroinflammation (31, 32),
would suggest a modulating effect of ORF8 on Bradykinin Storm.
Moreover, inflammatory conditions highly induce an up-regulation of Bradykinin receptor B1 (BKB1R) (50).
The results of our network-based model for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 mirror likely clinical manifestations
in severe COVID-19 patients, noting that analysis of published data about COVID-19 allows to synthesise and
describe complex aspect of pathogenesis, as reported for inflammatory cytokines storm in COVID-19-induced
respiratory failure (16).

Limitations
There are many experimental platforms for deriving such physical interactions, such as Affinity purification
mass-spectrometry (AP-MS) and yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H), which enable the accurate identification of
interactions with a relatively long time.

The scenario reported in this study refers to few experimental data available on public databases and could be
different respect to real phenotypes of COVID-19 patients.
The pathways’ analysis did not consider tissue and cell type diversity. Finally, the low threshold established
for the number of nodes found by RWR (200) limited the reconstruction of the entire pathways. However, this
was a software-imposed threshold. Although such network-based approach showed great potential in
identifying mechanisms not yet observed, experimental tests will be necessary to confirm what we have
described.

Conclusion
We developed a network-based model for SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be a framework for pathogenic
evaluation of specific clinical outcomes.
Here, the PPI interactomes were used to identify mechanistic processes of the viral molecular machinery during
SARS-CoV-2 infection, for viral survival and replication within the host. With this knowledge, proteins
interactions crucial for pathogenesis could be discerned. We identified different host response induced by
specific proteins of SARS-CoV-2, underlining the important role of ORF3a and ORF8 in phenotypes of severe
COVID-19 patients. The interactome approach applied to identification of biological reactions around
Kininogen-1, allowed to view NS7b and ORF3a interactions with ECE1, which might have a role to enhance
Bradykinin storm. This network-based model of SARS-CoV-2 - host interaction could guide to develop novel
treatments against specific viral proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies.

Methods and Materials
The virus–host interactome was made by merging SARS-CoV-2 –host protein-protein interaction (PPI) data
from Intact (51), with data from human PPI databases, such as BioGrid, InnateDB-All, IMEx, IntAct,
MatrixDB, MBInfo, MINT, Reactome, Reactome-FIs, UniProt, VirHostNet, BioData, obtained by R packages
PSICQUIC and biomaRt (52, 53). For SARS-CoV-2 - host interaction experimentally obtained, 1407 protein
interactors and 2305 interactions were download from IntAct at 12 September 2020. 28 SARS-CoV-2 proteins
are used for all the analyses: E, M, N, S, nsp1, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, nsp5, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12,
nsp13, nsp14, nsp15, nsp16, ORF1a, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, NS7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF10, ORF14.

To obtain functional information about PPI ex vitro, to simulate biological reactions in infected cells and to
explore cell response against viral infection, we employed a Random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, a
state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach(54). This algorithm allows to establish a proximity network from
a given protein (seed), to study its functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend
to lie close to each other in the network. For this study, two types of interactome were performed: the whole
SARS-CoV-2 -host interactome and an interactome per single SARS-COV-2 protein.
In the first imputation, every protein of SARS-CoV-2 proteome was used as seeds, with the limit of 200 closest
host’s proteins to every SAR-CoV-2 protein, every protein of SARS-CoV-2 proteome was chosen as seeds for
Random walk with restart, imposing the limit of 200 closest host proteins to every SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This
analysis allowed to design SARS-COV-2-host interactome, where the different colours correspond to the
localization of the proteins within the cell.
For the second kind of interactome, one SARS-CoV-2 per time was used as seed, lowering to closest 50
proteins in order to define the induced biological response as better as possible.
For each node, a score was computed as a measure of proximity to the seed protein (23). In total, a large PPI
interaction database was assembled, including 13334 nodes and 73584 interactions. Graphical representations
of networks were performed by GEPHI 0. 9. 2 (55). To identify hub protein in the SARS-CoV-2 - host
interactome, the values of betweenness centrality and degree were plotted. Betweenness centrality score
measure how a specific node is in-between other nodes and then can be considered a hub, while the degree of
node corresponds to number of connections.
Pathways of proteins involved in host response were tested by gene enrichment analysis on Kyoto
Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) human pathways and WikiPathways databases (56). To allow
gathering of results for every running, the R package enrichR was used, an R interface to web-based tool
'Enrichr' for analysing gene sets (57). The Enrichr analysis was performed using these statistical parameters:
p-value (Fisher exact test), q-value (adjusted p-value for false discovery rate, FDR). Results for KEGG and
WikiPathways were considered significant with a revised p-value < 0. 05. To infer pathways involved in single
viral interactome, gene enrichment analyses for each viral interactome were collected along with p-values, as

reported in enrichR package output. P-values of every single enrichment analyses were transformed by the
function x = − log10 (p-value) and the 5% of x values were plotted on heatmap by R package pheatmap (58).
