Abstract:
In the current COVID-19 pandemic context, Ensysce and its subsidiary Covistat have been working to
repurpose nafamostat mesylate as an effective oral and inhalation treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Prior reports used cell lines to demonstrate the antiviral potential of nafamostat against coronaviral infections
and determined its mechanism of action through inhibition of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
We selected a biologically relevant pre-clinical experimental model of SARS-CoV-2 lung infection using a
3D human reconstituted airway epithelial model of nasal origin to characterize the effects of nafamostat on
tissue-level cellular ultrastructure and viral infection kinetics. Our results confirm the not only the relevance
of this model for the preclinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of antiviral candidates, but also the highly
potent nature of nafamostat SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity. The studies described herein provided evidence
demonstrating the therapeutic potential of nafamostat against COVID-19, as well as its safety upon exposure
to lung airway cellular.
One Sentence Summary: Using a human airway model, study demonstrates the powerful inhibitory effect
of nafamostat on SARS-CoV-2 genome copy detection when applied apically.

INTRODUCTION
Nafamostat mesylate (herein referred to as nafamostat) is a synthetic, broad-specificity protease inhibitor of
the classical and alternate pathways of complement activation. Nafamostat inhibits serine proteases such as
F.VIIa, F.XIIa, kallikrein, thrombin, components of the complement system and trypsin. Nafamostat
prevents coagulation abnormalities, and organ failure induced by complement-activated leukocytes in animal
models of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (Cho et a. 2011; Hitomi and Fujji, 1982; Iwama et
al. 2003). Nafamostat (Futhan®, Torii Pharmaceuticals) is an approved pharmaceutical for intravenous,
intraarterial or extracorporeal use in Japan and Korea and has been used clinically since the 1980s (Honda et
al. 2003). Nafamostat has not been approved for oral, inhalational or intranasal use in any jurisdiction.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA
viruses that cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity in a broad
range of animal species, including humans. Over the past 12 years, at least 3 novel βCoVs have
emerged; severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV
(MERS-CoV), and most recently SARS-CoV-2, responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
which has caused an ever increasing number of cases and hospitalizations throughout the world.
Nafamostat has been shown to inhibit viral entry in MERS and COVID-19 CoVs (Yamamoto et al., 2016;
Hoffmann et al., 2020) and clinical trials with infusional nafamostat have been initiated in Asia.
Nafamostat’s inhibition of the proteolytic enzyme transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) which
activates the S protein, causing infection, allows it to target the host and not the virus itself, explaining its
broad utility against coronaviral infections. Ensysce had been exploring oral nafamostat for its ability to
potently inhibit trypsin, in the development of overdose protection for trypsin activated abuse protected
(TAAP) opioid prodrugs. These studies led to the current focus on the use of oral nafamostat to target the
SARS-CoV-2 in the gut that results in many of the gastro intestinal symptoms of COVID-19, as well as
intranasal nafamostat to prevent CoV viral entry in the human lung epithelia.
The safety and the efficacy of nafamostat were explored in the currently study, by its delivery to the apical
surface of lung epithelia, using MucilAir™ technology (Epithelix, Sarl). The model is a pseudostratified and
ready-to-use 3D model of human airway epithelium, constituted with primary human epithelial cells freshly
isolated from nasal, tracheal or bronchial biopsies. When switched at the air-liquid interface, the progenitor
cells undergo a progressive differentiation and polarization to a fully ciliated epithelia (Figure 1). The
mature MucilAir™ is composed of basal cells, ciliated cells and mucus cells. The proportion of these various
cell types is preserved compared to what one observes in vivo (Huang et al., 2011).
This airway model is functionally differentiated, secretes mucus and is electrically tight (TEER>200 Ω.cm2).
The activity of the main epithelial ionic channels, such as CFTR, EnaC, Na/K ATPase, is preserved and the
epithelia is shown to respond in a regulated and vectorial manner to the pro-inflammatory stimulus, TNF-α
(Huang et al., 2011). A large panel of cytokines, chemokines and metalloproteinases has been detected in the
model (e.g. IL-8, IL-6, GM-CSF, MMP-9, GRO-α). Most importantly, it replicates the main function of the
airway epithelial cells, the mucociliary clearance driven by synchronized cilia-beating.

The aim of this project was to evaluate antiviral effect of nafamostat upon SARS-CoV-2 viral infection
(French circulating strain) using fully differentiated human nasal epithelial cells cultured at the air-liquid
interface. Lung airway epithelia were reconstituted with a mixture of cells isolated from 14 different normal
nasal donors, and the studies of the tissue integrity were carried out by Epithelix, Sarl.
The project was divided into two steps. Phase 1 involved a toxicological evaluation by examining tissue
integrity, cytotoxicity, cilia beating and inflammatory reaction to repeated exposure to nafamostat. Phase 2
studied the effect of nafamostat on SARS-CoV-2 infection by measuring viral genome copy number after
repeated dosing.

Phase 1
Phase 1 evaluated nafamostat effect on tissue integrity following three exposures at time 0, 24 and 48 hr. Each
study was conducted in replicates of 3, Figure 2. Negative and positive controls were carried out in replicates of
6. Untreated or vehicle controls were used in replicates of 3 each. Positive controls included Triton X-100 (10 %,
50 µl apical, 24 hours; for cytotoxicity) N=3 and Cytomix (500 ng/ml TNFα, 0.2 mg/ml LPS, 1 % FCS; for
inflammation) N=3. Endpoints were assessed at 24, 48 and 72 hr (days 1, 2, and 3).

TEER
After addition of 200 µl of buffered saline/culture medium to the apical compartment of MucilAir™ cultures,
resistance was measured with an EVOMX volt-ohm-meter (World Precision Instruments UK, Stevenage) for
each condition. Resistance values (Ω) were converted to TEER (Ω.cm2) using the following formula: TEER
(Ω.cm2) = (resistance value (Ω) - 100(Ω)) x 0.33 (cm2), where 100 Ω is the resistance of the membrane and
0.33 cm2 is the total surface of the epithelium.
Cytotoxicity
Lactate dehydrogenase, a stable cytoplasmic enzyme that is rapidly released into the culture medium upon
rupture of the plasma membrane was used to measure cytotoxicity caused by nafamostat. Basolateral
medium (100 μl) was collected at each time-point and incubated with the reaction mixture of the
Cytotoxicity Detection KitPLUS (LDH) following the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma, Roche 04 744 926
001). The amount of the released LDH was quantified by measuring the absorbance of each sample at 490
nm with a microplate reader. To determine the percentage of cytotoxicity, the following equation was used
(A = absorbance values):
Cytotoxicity (%) = (A (exp value)-A (low control)/A (high control)-A (low control))*100.
The positive control value was obtained by 10 % Triton X-100 apical treatment (24 hours). Triton X-100
causes a massive LDH release and corresponds to 100 % cytotoxicity. The negative controls (non-treated and
vehicle) show a low daily basal LDH release, <5 %, which is due to a physiological cell turnover in
MucilAir™.

Cilia Beating Frequency (CBF)
Cilia beating frequency was measured by Epithelix using their in-house system consisting of three parts: a
Mako G030B camera connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope, a PCI card and a custom software.
The cilia beating frequency expressed as Hz. 256 images were captured at high frequency rate (125 frames
per second) at room temperature, cilia beating frequency was then calculated using validated Epithelix
software.
CBF values may be subject to fluctuations due to parameters such as temperature, mucus viscosity or liquid
applied on the apical surface of MucilAir™.

Interleukin 8 ELISA assay
Pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 8 (IL-8) was measured using ELISA assay (BD Biosciences 555244
(detection: 3-200 pg/ml) from basolateral medium of the airway cultures exposed to test compound. The
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Lyophilized standard was reconstituted,
aliquoted and stored at -80oC. Each ELISA plate contained a standard curve. Samples were diluted with the

appropriate assay diluent at the appropriate dilution rate, washing steps were performed manually and
absorbance was measured at 450 and 570 nm using Tecan Infinite 200.

Phase 2
Virus Inoculation
The SARS-CoV-2 strain used in the study was isolated by directly inoculating VeroE6 cell monolayers
with a nasal swab sample collected from Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris. Once characteristic
cytopathic effect was observable in more than 50% of the cell monolayer, supernatants were collected
and immediately stored at -80 °C. The complete viral genome sequence was obtained using Illumina
MiSeq sequencing technology and was deposited under the name BetaCoV/France/IDF0571/2020. Viral
stocks were titrated by tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID50/ml) in VeroE6 cells, using the Reed
& Muench statistical method. These studies were conducted at VirNext (BSL3 facilities).
Prior to infection, the apical side of the airway cultures were washed twice for 10 min. Inoculations were
performed with 150 μl at a theoretical multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (50 000 TCID50 for an
average of 500 000 cells in MucilAirTM), applied to the apical side of the cultures for 1 hour at 37°C, 5%
CO2. Non-infected control, Mock, was exposed also to 150 μl of culture medium on the apical side for 1
hour. Unbound viruses were removed after one hour of incubation period. New viral particles were
collected by 10 min apical washes at 48 and 72 hours post-inoculation and quantified by RT-qPCR.
Reference antiviral drug remdesivir was purchased from MedChemExpress, (HY-104077) and was
diluted in DMSO and used at 5 μΜ (final concentration of DMSO was 0.05 %) in the basolateral
medium of separate cells. The reference antiviral was added after one hour of viral inoculation and
changed every day.
Real-time Taqman probe RT-PCR
From the 200 μl apical washes, 140 μl was used for viral RNA extraction with the QIAamp® Viral RNA
kit (Qiagen), obtaining 60 μl of eluted RNA. Viral RNA was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR
(EXPRESS One-Step Superscript™ qRT-PCR Kit, Invitrogen, 1178101K) using 2 μl of viral RNA with
Mastermix and two ORF1b-nsp14 specific primers (5’-TGGGGYTTTACRGGTAACCT-3’; 5’AACRCGCTTAACAAAGCACTC-3’) and probe (5’-FAM-TAGTTGTGATGCWATCATGACTAGTAMRA-3’) of SARS-CoV-2 designed by the School of Public Health/University of Hong Kong (Leo
Poon, Daniel Chu and Malik Peiris). Samples were run on StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Ct data were determined and relative changes in gene expression were calculated
using the 2-ΔCt method and reported as the fold reduction relative to the mean of vehicle treated infected
inserts.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean. Differences between three or more groups were
tested by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-tests or nonparametric KruskalWallis test with Dunn’s post-tests using Prism 6 GraphPad software (La Jolla, USA). Differences

between two groups were tested by Student’s t test or nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The values
P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Phase 1: Evaluation of cytotoxicity of nafamostat on 3D airway epithelial model
Effect of Nafamostat on tissue integrity after repeated dosing
Nafamostat up to 20 µM did not cause any impairment of barrier function (tissue integrity limit was 100
ohm.cm2). The decrease of TEER at 2 and 20 µM suggested nafamostat caused an increase of ion channel
activity (Figure 3a). TEER is a dynamic parameter that reflects the state of epithelia and is typically between
200 to 600 Ω.cm2. An increase of the TEER value reflects a blockage of the ion channel activities. A notable

decrease of the TEER values (but > 100 Ω.cm2) could be observed in certain cases, reflecting an activation of
the ion channels. Disruption of cellular junction or holes in the epithelia result in TEER values below 100
Ω.cm2. When an epithelium is damaged, a decrease of TEER would be associated with an increase of LDH
release or a decrease of the cell viability.
Cytotoxicity of nafamostat after repeated dosing

There was no cytotoxicity observed following 3 days of dosing up to 20 µM, Figure 3b. Positive
control 10% Triton X-100 solution induced toxicity was 100%.
Effect of nafamostat on Cilia Beating
The vehicle treated cultures showed cilia beating frequency of 5.5-6 Hz at room temperature, which is in the
normal range of MucilAirTM (4-8 Hz). Exposure to nafamostat did not globally modify cilia motion. A small
increase of CBF was observed at 2 µM at Day 2 and Day 3, and CBF was found to be significantly higher
(20 µM Day 2), Figure 3c.
Effect of nafamostat on Interleukin 8
The vehicle treated cultures showed Interleukin 8 concentration of 12-18 ng/ml in the basal culture medium,
which is in the normal range of MucilAir™ (5-50 ng/ml). Exposure to nafamostat did not modify basal IL-8
secretion, Figure 3d. Cytomix induced a significant increase of basal IL-8 concentration (p<0.0001).

Phase 2: Antiviral assessment of Ensysce Biosciences’ compound upon SARS-CoV-2 infection
Relative virus genome copy
Exposure to Nafamostat showed dose dependent inhibition of apical genome copies of SARS-CoV-2 on the
3-D airway model. Exposure to nafamostat at 20 µM concentration strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2
replication at both time points, with p<0.05 at 48 hr and p<0.01 at 72 hr, Figure 4. The magnitude of
inhibition was 3.4 log at 48 hours and 6.2 log at 72 hours compared to vehicle. Exposure to nafamostat at
lower concentrations of 2 and 0.2 µM also showed an antiviral activity on apical SARS-CoV-2 genome
copies with an inhibition of 2.6 log at 48 hours and 4.3 log at 72 hours (2 µM) and 1 log at both time points
(0.2 µM), compared to vehicle.

Antiviral control remdesivir significantly reduced apical SARS-CoV-2 genome copies at both time points.
The magnitude of inhibition was 3.4 log (mean Ct was 29) at 48 hours (vs. 0.9 % NaCl with a mean Ct of
18.3) and 5.7 log (mean Ct was 31.9) at 72 hours (vs. 0.9 % NaCl with a mean Ct of 13.2).

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to evaluate nafamostat on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
infection of in vitro respiratory epithelium. The epithelia used were of nasal origin from 14 donors, in a
platform called MucilAir™-Pool. Initial evaluation of human airway epithelial cells potential toxicity by
nafamostat demonstrated that there was no disruption of the tissue integrity at any of concentrations tested,
by any of the methodology used. Modest ion channel activity was observed along with an increase in ciliary
beating the two highest concentrations. These effects are considered to be beneficial for removal of mucoid
material from lungs.
The study to evaluate the effects of nafamostat on SARS-CoV-2 infection, epithelia were pre-treated (1 hour)
and retreated with nafamostat on the apical side once a day every day after respiratory virus infection. This
treatment simulates the condition of using an inhalation nafamostat drug product for COVID-19 treatment.
Quantification of effect of nafamostat on apical viral replication was measured by RT-PCR (genome copy
number).
Although prior reports had suggested SARS-CoV-2 to cause a decreased TEER (Pizzorno et al., 2020), in
this study SARS-CoV-2 did not modify tissue integrity, Figure 5.
Exposure of the apical surface of the 3-D airway model to nafamostat shows dose dependent inhibition of
apical genome copies of SARS-CoV-2. This data supports that reported by others who elucidated the
mechanism of action of nafamostat on SARS-CoV-2 using cell lines. Nafamostat, an ultrapotent protease
inhibitor, inhibits TMPRESS2, and here was shown to reduce viral entry over a range of concentrations. A
decrease in viral copy of 1 log was observed at concentrations as low as 0.2 µM. A dose and time dependent
effect was observed, with nafamostat (20 µM) at 72 hr providing a greater reduction of viral copy than that
produced by remdesivir.
This study demonstrates both the safety and the powerful inhibitory effect of nafamostat when applied
apically on human airway epithelia on SARS-CoV-2 genome copy detection.
