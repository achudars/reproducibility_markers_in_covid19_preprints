Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a new human
pathogen in late 2019 and has infected an estimated 10% of the global population in less than
a year. There is a clear need for effective antiviral drugs to complement current preventive
measures including vaccines. In this study, we demonstrate that berberine and obatoclax, two
broad-spectrum antiviral compounds, are effective against multiple isolates of SARS-CoV-2.
Berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations
and obatoclax, originally developed as an anti-apoptotic protein antagonist, was effective at
sub-micromolar concentrations. Time-of-addition studies indicated that berberine acts on the
late stage of the viral life cycle. In agreement, berberine mildly affected viral RNA synthesis,
but strongly reduced infectious viral titers, leading to an increase in the particle-to-pfu ratio.
In contrast, obatoclax acted at the early stage of the infection, in line with its activity to
neutralize the acidic environment in endosomes. We assessed infection of primary human
nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface and found that SARS-CoV-2 infection
induced and repressed expression of a specific set of cytokines and chemokines. Moreover,
both obatoclax and berberine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in these primary target cells.
We propose berberine and obatoclax as potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 that
could be considered for further efficacy testing.

Introduction
Coronaviruses form a group of respiratory viruses in the order Nidovirales that possess a
positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kb (1). Two coronaviruses of zoonotic origin
caused significant outbreaks in the near past, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) (2, 3) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (4). In
late 2019, a new coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV emerged in Wuhan, China, and
rapidly spread across the globe. As of today, more than 60 million SARS-CoV-2 cases have
been confirmed worldwide, but recent estimates from the World Health Organization suggest
that that the total number may be more than 20 times higher due to asymptomatic and
undetected cases (5) (WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard, https://covid19.who.int/).
SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells in the nasal and oral cavities via binding of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein to the ACE2 receptor (6). The spike glycoprotein requires cleavage by the
protease TMPRSS2 to convert it into an active form allowing fusion at the plasma membrane
(7, 8). An additional furin cleavage site in the spike protein makes it also amenable to cleavage
by intracellular proteases (9, 10). In permissive cells lacking TMPRSS2, receptor binding is
most likely followed by dynamin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the virus particle into
endosomal compartments (11). Acidification of these compartments leads to activation of
cathepsin-B/L proteases which prime the spike protein, initiating membrane fusion and
release of the encapsidated viral RNA into the cytoplasm (12, 13). Upon nucleocapsid
disassembly, the viral positive-sense RNA genome is translated into two open reading frames
that encode for several non-structural proteins [reviewed in (14-16)]. These proteins
constitute the machinery that replicates the viral RNA and transcribes subgenomic RNAs that
code for viral structural proteins and several accessory proteins (15). Newly formed viral
genomic RNA is coated with nucleocapsid proteins, which interact with the structural
proteins, resulting in budding into and transit through the ER-Golgi network and release of
mature viral particles through exocytosis (15, 16). The virus then spreads to the lower
respiratory tract and infects alveolar type-II pneumocytes in the lungs, where a severe
infection could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (6, 17).
A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an unprecedented fast development of
vaccines (18), as well as study of antiviral of adjunctive host-directed therapy. Apart from
dexamethasone (19), however, none has been proved effective. As preventive measures
including vaccines are unlikely to curb the epidemic alone, there is a clear need for improved
antiviral therapy. This could be applied either preventively, or after symptom development.
In this study, we assessed the plant-based alkaloid berberine and obatoclax, an anticancer
drug proven safe in clinical trials, as possible antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2. Both
berberine (BBR) (20-22) and obatoclax (OLX) (23, 24) have broad-spectrum antiviral activity
against a range of different viruses including herpes simplex virus, influenza A virus,
chikungunya virus and Zika virus. We show that these compounds are effective against two
different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 at low micromolar concentrations with promising selectivity
indices. Antiviral activity was observed in Vero E6 cells as well as in physiologically relevant
nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface. We propose these compounds for
further assessment as antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Berberine and obatoclax inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication
BBR and OLX have shown antiviral activity against viruses from multiple families (20-24). We
therefore tested these compounds against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. A virus growth curve
was performed to determine the optimal time point for the assay. At a low multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.01, SARS-CoV-2 titers peaked at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) (Fig. S1A).
Robust infection of Vero E6 cells was confirmed through staining infected cells for the
presence of dsRNA replication intermediates and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. dsRNA
staining was observed in the perinuclear area, likely corresponding to the ER-Golgi network
containing SARS-CoV-2 replication complexes (Fig. S1B). Spike protein expression was also
detected in the perinuclear area where they are synthesized, but also on the outer periphery
of the cells, probably from viruses exiting the infected cells.
Next, a dose response assay was carried out under these conditions with a series of
concentrations of BBR and OLX, using 0.1% DMSO as a negative control. Plaque assay
titrations of the viral supernatants showed that both BBR and OLX are effective against SARSCoV-2 with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values at low micromolar and nanomolar
concentrations (EC50 BBR = 9.1 µM and EC50 OLX = 67 nM, respectively; Fig. 1A and B).
Cytotoxicity of these compounds was tested under the same conditions, but in the absence
of SARS-CoV-2 infection. BBR was toxic only at the highest concentrations tested (50% cellular
cytotoxicity, CC50 > 150 µM), resulting in a selectivity index of >16 (Fig. 1C), whereas the CC50
value for OLX was 7.8 µM (Fig. 1D), corresponding to a high selectivity index of 116 due to its
low EC50 value. Overall, these results indicate that BBR and OLX show potent antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-2 with good selectivity indices.
Berberine and obatoclax are effective against a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a different
geographic region
Our initial antiviral assays were performed using a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from Bavaria, Germany
(BavPat1). To assess whether BBR and OLX are also effective against another SARS-CoV-2
isolate, we isolated a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a hospitalized COVID-19 patient at Radboud
University
Medical
Center,
the
Netherlands.
This
isolate,
SARS-CoV2/human/Nijmegen/1/2020 (hereafter called Nijmegen1), had a relatively small plaque
phenotype (Fig. S2), in agreement with the relatively passage history in Vero cells (25, 26).
We used the Nijmegen1 isolate to perform dose response assays with BBR and OLX, using
viral RNA in the cell culture supernatants as a readout (Fig. 2). OLX showed stronger antiviral
activity for the Nijmegen1 isolate (EC50 = < 0.04 µM) (Fig. 2B) as compared to the BavPat1
isolate. In contrast, BBR showed relatively weak antiviral activity against the Nijmegen1
isolate (EC50 = 23.2 µM for viral RNA in the supernatant and EC50 = 43.3 µM for intracellular
viral RNA; Fig. 2A) as compared to the initial experiments in which infectious titers were used
as a readout. We therefore used conventional plaque assay to assess the antiviral activity of
BBR against the SARS-CoV-2 Nijmegen1 isolate. We observed strong antiviral activity (EC50 =
2.1 µM) (Fig. 2C), which was slightly lower than for the BavPat1 isolate.
These results suggest that BBR does not inhibit viral RNA replication per se, but that it affects
the production of infectious virus. To quantify this, we calculated the relative genome copy
to infectious virus particle ratio for the different concentrations of berberine. Indeed, when
compared to the DMSO control, this ratio increased upon BBR treatment in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2D). Altogether these results confirmed that both BBR and OLX are effective

against a second, early passage isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we conclude that BBR does
not affect viral RNA replication or secretion of viral particles, but that it strongly affects the
infectivity of the virus particles produced.
Berberine and obatoclax act at different stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle
To decipher a putative mode of action for BBR and OLX, we performed a time-of-addition
assay. Vero E6 cells were infected at MOI of 1, adding 20 µM BBR or 0.25 µM OLX at different
time points during the course of the experiment (Fig. 3A). Cell culture supernatants were
harvested at 10 hpi and infectious viral titers were measured by plaque assay. OLX showed a
very potent inhibition of 3 logs at the early stages of the viral life cycle. The levels of inhibition
gradually decrease as OLX is added at later time points of the experiment (Fig. 3B), suggesting
that OLX most likely affects the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle. Indeed, when
OLX was added during the 1 h of virus adsorption and subsequently discontinued, it reduced
viral titers by 1.5 logs, indicating that the compound inhibits viral entry.
For BBR, an inhibition of almost 1.5 logs was seen when the compound was added to the cells
2 h prior to inoculation and maintained throughout the experiment. However, no inhibition
was observed when BBR is only added during the 1 h of virus adsorption. Potent inhibition of
1 log was observed when BBR was added during inoculation and continuously maintained
thereafter. Strikingly, BBR continues to be equally effective at reducing viral titers even when
added at 7.5 hpi, indicating that it acts late in the viral infection cycle (Fig. 3B), in line with our
conclusion that BBR affects the production of infectious virus particles (Fig. 2).
SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells
Even though SARS-CoV-2 efficiently replicates in Vero E6 cells, these cells are derived from
the African green monkey kidney and have a defective interferon pathway (27) and are thus
not representative of natural target cells. It is therefore essential to validate candidate
antiviral compounds in human host cells (28). We therefore cultured and differentiated
human nasal epithelial cells, which were residual after surgery, on an air-liquid interface. This
approach to mimic the natural environment of the infected host has previously been used in
the study of circulating seasonal human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43,
HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, as well as the zoonotic SARS and MERS coronaviruses (29).
Virus replication was assessed to determine the optimal time point for antiviral assays. We
analyzed intracellular RNA, extracellular RNA from apical and basal supernatants, infectious
viral titers and viral protein expression at different time points post-infection. Peak
intracellular viral RNA levels were detected at 72 hpi (Fig. 4A). No time-dependent increase in
viral RNA levels was observed in basolateral supernatants, suggesting inefficient release of
virus into this compartment. In contrast, viral RNA signals from the apical surface
supernatants were at their highest at 72 hpi, corresponding to the kinetics of intracellular
RNA (Fig. 4B). Preferential release from the apical membrane in polarized epithelial cells has
been observed before for multiple viruses, including SARS-CoV (30-32). Infectious viral titers
from the apical supernatants also showed active viral replication, with peak titers at 72 hpi
(Fig. 4C) in line with the viral RNA kinetics (Fig. 4A, 4B).
The nasal epithelium contains both ciliated cells and mucus producing goblet cells after 4
weeks of differentiation on the air-liquid interface (Fig. S3). To assess infection of these cell
types, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression by immunofluorescence microscopy.
To validate the anti-Spike protein antibody used, we first analyzed SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero
E6 cells and observed abundant S protein expression in the perinuclear area as well as the

periphery (Fig. 4D). In SARS-CoV-2 infected nasal epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 S protein was
detected from 48-72 hpi onwards (Fig. S3). In these cells, the S protein was mostly located at
the outer cell periphery, and, as expected, at much lower levels than in Vero E6 cells. At 0 hpi,
some S protein staining is also visible, likely corresponding to viral particles that have not
internalized and remain attached to the cell surface (Fig. S3). Additionally, the epithelial cells
were stained for the differentiation markers tubulin IV and Muc5Ac to identify ciliated cells
and goblet cells, respectively. It did not appear that viral infection was more abundant in
either of these cell types (Fig. 4D, S3).
Cytokine and chemokine responses are selectively enhanced or inhibited during SARS-CoV2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells
To assess the epithelial (immune) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we measured cytokine
and chemokine concentrations in the cell culture medium of primary nasal epithelial cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 from 0 to 96 hpi. Cytokines and chemokines associated with
granulocyte (CXCL1 and CXCL8), monocyte (CXCL10, CCL4, and CCL20), NK cell (CXCL10 and
CCL4) and T cell (CCL20, CCL17, and CXCL10) chemotaxis and activation increased over time
compared to the mock infected cells (Fig. 5A). CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL4, and CCL20
showed a more rapid production rate between 48 and 96 hpi, which is in line with the viral
replication kinetics that we observed (Fig. 4), suggesting that viral replication triggers cytokine
and chemokine production in these cells. Strikingly, the cytokines that are typically associated
with viral infections and acute phase reactions (IL-1β, TNF-α2, IL-6, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2,3) did
not show increased production compared to mock infected cells, with the exception of IL-1β
(Fig. 5A and Fig. S4). Furthermore, within the first 48 h of infection, the production of CXCL5,
CCL3, CCL5, and, to a lesser extent, GM-CSF was reduced (Fig. 5B). This could be indicative of
immune evasive activity of SARS-CoV-2.
These data suggest that the epithelium selectively stimulates cellular immune responses in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the virus inhibits secretion of specific cytokines. Both
processes appear to be selective as for various other cytokines no difference in production
could be observed between infected cells and mock infected cells (Fig. S4). Other cytokines
that we tested, such as IFN-α, IFN-β, IL-10, and IL-12p70 were not produced by the epithelium
at all (data not shown). Together, these data indicate a specific and dynamic interaction
between airway epithelial cells and SARS-CoV-2.
Berberine and obatoclax are effective against SARS-CoV-2 in nasal epithelial cells
Having established primary nasal epithelial cells as a relevant cellular model for SARS-CoV-2
infection, we assessed the antiviral activity of BBR and OBX in these cells. Nasal epithelial cells
were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of BBR or OLX
along with DMSO as a negative control and viral RNA levels were assessed at 72 hpi. BBR was
effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in the supernatant of this nasal epithelial cell
model with an EC50 value of 10.7 µM (Fig. 6A), similar to that seen in Vero E6 cells. Likewise,
OLX was effective in the sub-micromolar range with an EC50 value of 0.2 µM. Cytotoxicity
assays were done with BBR and OLX over a 72h time period. There was a slight increase in
toxicity in these cells as compared to the shorter 24 h exposure period in Vero E6 cells (Fig.
6C and D), resulting in lower selectivity indices for both compounds (SI=8.1 and 32.7 for BBR
and OLX, respectively) than in Vero E6 cells. Altogether, these results indicate that BBR and
OLX effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in a physiologically relevant human nasal
epithelial cell model.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread across the world, causing large-scale morbidity
and mortality (5) (WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard, https://covid19.who.int/) and huge
economic losses (33). Effective treatment for patients who fall ill despite vaccination or other
preventive measures is urgently needed. In this study, we propose to repurpose BBR and OLX,
two compounds with good safety profiles in clinical trials as potential therapeutic options
against SARS-CoV-2.
BBR is an isoquinoline alkaloid derived from the Chinese herb Coptis chinensis and plants of
the Berberis genus (34). Its wide-ranging biological properties identified in pre-clinical studies
include anti-inflammatory, anti-arrhythmic, antimicrobial (35), and cholesterol-lowering (36)
activity. In a large phase IV study randomising 612 patients, a treatment regimen containing
1000 mg BBR daily was not more effective in treating Helicobacter pylori than a comparator
treatment, but it was well tolerated apart from a bitter taste (20%) and nausea (12%) as the
most outspoken side effects (37). Previous studies also identified a favourable safety profile,
with predominantly mild gastrointestinal side effects (38). BBR has not found a place in clinical
practise, but five placebo-controlled clinical trials are currently recruiting patients to study
the effect of BBR against a range of conditions, including colorectal adenomas, schizophrenia
and diabetes (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers NCT03281096, NCT03333265, NCT03378934,
NCT02808351, NCT02983188, NCT03976336, NCT03198572, NCT02737943).
BBR has broad spectrum antiviral activity in vitro against viruses from several different
families, including influenza A virus, enterovirus, chikungunya virus, hepatitis B and C viruses,
HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and human
papilloma virus [reviewed in (39)]. We show here that BBR is effective against SARS-CoV-2 at
low micromolar concentrations in Vero E6 cells. While this manuscript was in preparation, our
results were confirmed by another study showing the antiviral activity of BBR against SARSCoV-2 also in Vero E6 cells at a similar EC50 value (10.6 µM) (40). Our study adds the validation
of this finding in physiologically relevant primary nasal epithelial cells, where BBR is equally
effective against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we show that BBR acts late in the viral life cycle
and likely induces the formation of non-infectious virus particles. Congruently, BBR also
inhibited replication of the alphaviruses Semliki Forest virus and chikungunya virus at a late
stage (41), likely by interfering with capsid protein-viral RNA interactions, leading to
nucleocapsid assembly or disassembly defects and less infectious viral particles (42). It
remains to be confirmed whether BBR has similar effects on assembly of SARS-CoV-2 virions.
In addition to inducing possible assembly affects, BBR may affect cellular pathways to reduce
SARS-CoV-2 replication. BBR targets several cellular signalling pathways including major MAPkinase pathways (ERK, p38 MAPK and JNK), as well as the NF-κB and the AMPK/m-TOR
signalling pathways (43, 44). Many viruses upregulate these pathways to maximally utilize
cellular resources for their replication (45). The modulation of these pathways by BBR has
been implicated in its antiviral activity against several different viruses, including chikungunya
virus (22), enterovirus 71 (21) and herpes simplex virus (20). A recent proteomic analysis of
SARS-CoV-2 interaction networks revealed that the p38 MAP kinase pathway was upregulated
to counteract the host immune system. In agreement, inhibitors specifically targeting the p38
MAPK displayed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (46). Modulation of these cellular
pathways needed for productive virus infection, could be a second mechanism through which
BBR inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication.

OLX was originally developed as an inhibitor of Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins (47). OLX has been through phase I and II trials for a range of malignancies.
Convincing antitumor effects have thus far not been demonstrated, but obatoclax proved safe
in doses of 20-40 mg/m2. The most reported adverse events are dose-related grade 1 or 2
neurological symptoms shortly after infusion (48-53)
OLX has broad-spectrum antiviral activity, employing a mechanism independent of its proapoptotic activity. OLX acts as a weak base and rapidly neutralizes the acidic environment of
endosomes and endolysosomes (23). The acidification of endosomes is employed as an entry
mechanism by enveloped viruses of several different families, including SARS-CoV-2 in
TMPRSS2-negative target cells where endosomal cathepsin B/L proteases are activated by a
drop in endosomal pH (7, 13, 54). We found that OLX inhibited SARS-CoV-2 at sub-micromolar
concentrations in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 0.06 µM) with a very high selectivity index. This
confirms the results of another study in which OLX was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2induced cytotoxicity in Vero E6 cells (55). Our time-of-addition assays confirmed the early
effect of OLX, in alignment with the expected mechanism of virus entry inhibition. Moreover,
we observe antiviral activity in nasal epithelial cells, with a three-fold higher EC50 value as
compared to Vero E6 cells. This is probably due to SARS-CoV-2 entry in airway epithelial cells
being predominantly dependent on TMPRSS2 protease priming of the viral spike protein (7,
54). However, unlike chloroquine, which also increases the endosomal pH but does not inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial cells (28), we observe an antiviral effect with OLX
albeit with a lower but acceptable selectivity index. In clinical studies where OLX was
administered intravenously over 3 hours, plasma level concentrations of ~0.4 µM were
obtained (48, 49), suggesting that it would be possible to achieve therapeutic dose levels to
treat COVID-19.
To identify candidate antiviral compounds, it is important to assess antiviral activity in
physiologically relevant in vitro models as drug sensitivities may be cell-type specific (28, 56).
We therefore characterized SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary nasal epithelial cells, which are
one of the first cells the virus encounters during infection (57). Expectedly, in these cells with
an active innate immune system, SARS-CoV-2 showed lower replication kinetics and reached
lower titers than in Vero E6 cells. Still, robust time-dependent increase in SARS-CoV-2
replication was seen using multiple assessment parameters – viral RNA levels, titers and viral
protein expression. The viral titers we obtained correspond well to those observed previously
in human tracheobronchial epithelial cells grown on an air-liquid interface (58). In
undifferentiated human airway epithelium, reconstituted from human primary nasal cells
from a pool of 14 donors, higher SARS-CoV-2 titers were observed (59). We used
differentiated cells from the post-operative tissue of a single donor, which may contribute to
the observed differences.
SARS-CoV-2 infection of primary nasal epithelial cells induced epithelial release of CXCL1,
CXCL8, CXCL10, CCL4, CCL20, CCL17 and IL1β. In contrast, we did not observe an increase in
TNFα, IL-6, IFN-, IFN-λ1, and IFN-λ2,3, cytokines that are typically involved in antiviral
reactions and acute phase induction (60, 61). These observations might suggest that epithelial
cells recruit leucocytes to the site of infection, rather than initiating an acute phase reaction
themselves. Interestingly, viral infection also leads to reduced production of CXCL5, CCL5,
CCL3 and GM-CSF, which are mainly involved in the attraction and activation of granulocytes

and monocytes (62), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 actively inhibits the recruitment of
leukocytes early in infection.
In contrast to our findings, Pizzorno et al. observed a minor increase in IL-1β and TNFα mRNA
levels, and a larger increase in IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2,3,4 mRNA levels in nasal epithelial cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (59). This discrepancy could be due to several differences in
experimental setup, including the readouts (intracellular RNA versus protein in the
supernatant), the use of cells from a pool of donors from different anatomical locations, and
differentiation state (59).
In conclusion, our study puts forth two small molecule compounds, BBR and OLX, as
repurposed antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2, in doses lower than previously shown to
be safe in human clinical trials. While OLX is effective at early steps of the viral life cycle, likely
interfering with entry processes, BBR acts on the later stages and likely reduces the infectivity
of newly produced virions. BBR and OLX are effective in a physiologically relevant cell culture
model at low micromolar concentrations and could be considered for further assessment.

Materials and Methods
Cells
African green monkey Vero E6 (ATCC CRL-1586) and Vero FM (ATCC CCL-81) kidney cells were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium containing 4.5 g/L glucose and L-glutamine
(Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Sigma Aldrich), 100 µg/ml
streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Post-operative residual tissue originating from the posterior nasal septum of a 17-year-old
male was obtained after informed consent, according to the principles of the declaration of
Helsinki. The patient had a fully normal nasal epithelium and no history of allergy, (chronic)
rhinosinusitis or other mucosal disease. A single cell suspension was made by incubating the
tissue in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco) with 1 mg/ml collagenase from clostridium
histolyticum (Sigma) and 0.02 mg/ml DNase 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 37°C. The cell
suspension was filtered through a 70 µm cell strainer and the flow-through was collected.
Cells were cultured and expanded in PneumaCult-Ex Basal plus Medium with supplements
(Stemcell), 0.48 µg/ml hydrocortisone (Stemcell), and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 100 U/ml
penicillin (Lonza), according to manufacturer’s protocol (Stemcell). 50,000 primary nasal
epithelial cells were seeded on 0.4 μm pore polyester membrane inserts (Corning) and
expanded for 1 week in PneumaCult-Ex Basal plus Medium at 37°C and 5% CO2. When the
cells had formed a tight epithelial layer, they were cultured on an air-liquid interface by
discarding the apical medium and adding PneumaCult-ALI Basal Medium with supplements
(Stemcell), 4 µg/ml heparin (Stemcell), 0.48 µg/ml hydrocortisone (Stemcell), and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin and 100 U/ml penicillin (Lonza) to the basal compartment to induce
differentiation. Cells were differentiated for 4 weeks on this air-liquid interface. Prior to
experiments, the cells were cultured for 3 days in PneumaCult-ALI Basal Medium without
heparin, hydrocortisone, and antibiotics (63).
Viruses
SARS-CoV-2 isolate BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020 (European Virus Archive no. 026V-03883)
was kindly provided by Prof. C. Drosten (Charité-Universitätsmedizin, Berlin Institute of
Virology, Berlin, Germany) and was initially cultured in Vero E6 cells up to three passages in
the laboratory of Prof. B. Haagmans (Viroscience Department, Erasmus Medical Center,
Rotterdam, The Netherlands). To prepare virus stock, Vero FM cells were infected with
passage 3 stock at an MOI of 0.01 in virus infection medium [DMEM (Gibco) containing 2%
FCS (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mM HEPES buffer (Gibco), 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 100 IU/ml
penicillin (Gibco). At 48 hpi cell culture supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 4700 x g
for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris, filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter (Whatman)
and stored as 100 µl aliquots at -80°C.
SARS-CoV-2 isolate CoV-2/human/Nijmegen/1/2020 was isolated from an oro-nasopharyngeal
swab of a 65-year old male COVID-19 patient hospitalized at Radboud University Medical
Center in May 2020, collected as part of an ongoing study on COVD-19 infectiousness and
viral kinetics. The study was approved by the Committee on Research Involving Human
Subjects Arnhem Nijmegen (CMO NL2020-6517) and conducted according to the principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki (last updated 2013) and in accordance with the Medical Research
Involving Human Subjects Act (Dutch: WMO). Verbal consent was provided at inclusion and
separate verbal consent was obtained for the use of isolated virus in additional experiments.

The nasal swab was initially stored in virus transport medium [Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution
(Gibco) containing 2% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 µg/ml gentamycin (Gibco) and 0.5 µg/ml
amphotericin-B (Gibco)]. Vero FM cells seeded in 24-well plates were infected in duplicate
with 100 µl 2-fold serial dilutions of patient material in a total volume of 200 µl using virus
isolation medium [DMEM (Gibco) containing, 20 mM HEPES buffer (Gibco), 100 µg/ml
streptomycin (Gibco), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Gibco), 1% amphotericin B (Gibco)]. After 1 h
adsorption, viral inoculum was discarded, cells were washed with PBS, and 500 µl virus
isolation medium containing 2% FCS was added. 100 µl of supernatant was collected at 2, 4
and 6 days post-infection, subjected to RNA isolation and RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
The rest of the supernatants were stored at -80°C. Supernatant from which a positive signal
was obtained in RT-qPCR was titrated by conventional plaque assay and was cultured in Vero
FM cells at MOI 0.01 to obtain passage 1 working stocks. The near full-length viral sequence
of the isolate was deduced by amplicon-based next-generation sequencing, supplemented
with Sanger sequencing to fill few gaps in the obtained sequence. The sequence will be
deposited in GenBank.
Virus titration
Vero E6 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at a density of 5 x 105 cells/well. At 24 h postseeding, cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with 200 µl 10-fold serial dilutions of
the virus. After 1 h adsorption, the inoculum was discarded, cells were washed with PBS and
overlay medium containing Minimum essential medium (MEM, Gibco), 2% FCS (SigmaAldrich), 20 mM HEPES buffer (Gibco), 0.75% carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich), 100
µg/ml streptomycin and 100 IU/ml penicillin (Gibco) was added onto the cells. At 48 hpi, the
medium was discarded, cells were washed with PBS, and stained with 0.25% crystal violet
solution containing 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes. Plates were then washed with doubledistilled water, dried and plaques were counted.
Infection of primary nasal epithelial cells
Differentiated primary nasal epithelial cells seeded onto 0.4 µm pore polyester membrane
inserts (Corning) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 isolate at MOI 10 at both the apical
and basolateral surfaces. At 2 hpi, the inoculum was discarded, cells were washed with PBS
and fresh PneumaCult-ALI Basal Medium (Stemcell) without heparin, hydrocortisone and
antibiotics was added to the basolateral compartment. At the desired time point, 200 µl of
pre-warmed medium was added to the apical surface of the cells and incubated for 10 min at
37°C. Apical and basolateral supernatants were collected for titration or RNA isolation.
Intracellular RNA was isolated using RNA-Solv reagent (Omega Bio-tek) according to
manufacturer’s protocols, using glycogen during precipitation.
Antiviral assay
BBR (Sigma-Aldrich) and OLX (Selleck Chemicals) were dissolved in DMSO at a stock
concentration of 10 mM. Vero E6 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 x
105 cells/well. 24 h post-seeding, cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with the
SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 or Nijmegen1 isolate at MOI 0.01 in the presence of eight concentrations
of BBR (150 µM – 1.2 µM) or OLX (5 µM – 0.04 µM) in a two-fold dilution series. As a negative
control, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of 0.1% DMSO, corresponding to the DMSO
concentration in cells treated with 10 µM of compound. At 1 hpi, virus inoculum was
discarded, cells were washed with PBS and replaced with infection medium containing the

same concentrations of the inhibitors. At 24 hpi, cell culture supernatants were collected and
stored at -80°C for plaque titration. RNA was isolated from cells or 100 µl cell culture
supernatant using RNA-Solv reagent (Omega Bio-Tek) and precipitated in the presence of
glycogen.
Differentiated primary nasal epithelial cells, seeded onto 0.4 µm pore polyester membrane
inserts (Corning), were infected with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 isolate at MOI 10 at both the apical
and basolateral surfaces in the presence of a two-fold dilution series of BBR (4.7 µM - 150
µM) or OLX (0.08 µM - 5 µM). At 2 hpi, the inoculum was discarded, cells were washed with
PBS and fresh PneumaCult-ALI Basal Medium without heparin, hydrocortisone, and
antibiotics, containing the same concentrations of BBR or OLX was added to the basolateral
compartment. SARS-CoV-2 infection in the presence of 0.1% DMSO was used as a negative
control. At 72 hpi, 200 µl of pre-warmed medium was added to the apical surface of the cells
and incubated for 10 min at 37°C and 200 µl was collected for RNA isolation. The effective
concentration of compound that reduced viral levels by 50% (EC50) was estimated by four
parameter logistic regression, using Graphpad Prism (version 5.0). The selectivity index (SI)
was defined as CC50/EC50.
Cell viability assay
Vero E6 cells seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3 x 104 cells/well were treated with the
same concentrations of BBR and OLX used in the antiviral assay in the absence of SARS-CoV2 infection. Cells treated with 0.1% DMSO were used as a negative control. At 24 h posttreatment, cell viability was assessed using the Cell Titer Glo 2.0 kit (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Luminescence was detected on the Victor Multilabel Plate
Reader (Perkin Elmer). The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) value was estimated by four
parameter logistic regression of the data, using Graphpad Prism (version 5.0).
Time-of-addition assay
Vero E6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 x 104 cells/well. At 24 h postseeding, cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 isolate at
MOI 1. At indicated time points during the course of the experiment, 20 µM BBR, 0.25 µM
OLX, or 0.1% DMSO was added. Cell culture supernatants were collected at 10 hpi and
infectious viral titers were analyzed estimated by plaque assay.
RT-qPCR
TaqMan Reverse Transcription reagent and random hexamers (Applied Biosystems) were
used for cDNA synthesis. Semi-quantitative real-time PCR was performed using GoTaq qPCR
Master Mix (Promega) using primers targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E protein gene (forward
primer,
5′-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3′;
reverse
primer,
5′ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3’). A standard curve of a plasmid containing the E gene
qPCR amplicon was used to convert Ct values to relative genome copy numbers. Human and
African green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus) β-actin were used as housekeeping genes for
normalization (Human β-actin, forward primer 5′-CCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTG-3′ and reverse
primer 5′-GGAGCAATGATCTTGATCTTC-3′; African green monkey β-actin, forward primer 5′ATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGTCAGCAATGCCAGGGTA-3′).

Primary nasal epithelial cells were mock-infected with PneumaCult-ALI Basal Medium for 2 h
or infected with SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1 isolate at MOI 10. Vero E6 cells were infected with SARSCoV-2 BavPat1 isolate at MOI 0.01 or mock-infected for 1 h at 37°C, after which cells were
washed with PBS. Primary nasal epithelial cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 0, 24, 48,
72, and 96 hpi. Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4) were fixed at 24 hpi. Cells were permeabilised with 0.1%
Triton X-100 for 5 minutes, blocked with 2% Normal Serum Block (BioLegend), 1% BSA, and
0.0005% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 minutes. Primary nasal epithelial cells and Vero E6 cells
(Fig. 4 and Fig. S3) were stained for 1 h with 0.01 mg/ml rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1
subunit (clone#007, Sino Biologicals) and 0.03 mg/ml mouse anti-Tubulin IV (cloneONS.1A6,
Sigma) or mouse anti-Muc5AC (clone 45M1, Invitrogen). Subsequently, the cells were stained
for 1 h with 0.01 mg/ml goat anti-mouse Dylight 488 (Biolegend), 0.01 mg/ml donkey antirabbit AF555 (Biolegend), and a 1:2000 dilution of phalloidin-iFluor 647 reagent (Abcam).
Vero E6 cells (Fig. S1) were stained for 1 h with anti-SARS-CoV Spike S1 subunit human IgG1
(BEI Resources) and mouse anti-dsRNA J2 monoclonal antibody (Scicons). Goat anti-mouse
Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) were used at
1:500 dilutions for secondary staining. The polyester membrane containing the nasal
epithelial cells was cut out of the insert with a scalpel and placed on a microscopy slide,
embedded in ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen), and covered with
a coverslip. Vero E6 that had been grown on coverslips were embedded in the same way.
Fluorescent images were made using a Leica Dmi8 microscope (Leica) with 20× and 100×
objectives and Leica CFC7000 GT camera using LAS X 3.4.2 software. Confocal images for Vero
E6 cells in Fig. S1B were captured using a Zeiss LSM9000 microscope with a 63× oil objective
and processed using FIJI software.
Cytokine and chemokine analysis
Primary nasal epithelial cells cultured on an air-liquid interface were infected with SARS-CoV2 (BavPat1 isolate) at MOI 10 or mock infected. Samples were taken from the basolateral
medium over time and the concentration of chemokines and cytokines was determined using
the LEGENDplex Human Anti-Virus Response Panel (13-plex) and the LEGENDplex Human
Proinflammatory Chemokine Panel (13-plex) on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD). Samples
were run in duplicate and measured at two different dilutions.

Figures

Fig 1. Berberine and obatoclax are effective antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2. Vero E6 cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BavPat1 isolate) at an MOI of 0.01 for 24 h in the presence of the indicated
concentrations of (A) berberine (BBR) or (B) obatoclax (OLX) in a two-fold dilution series or 0.1% DMSO.
Infectious viral titers from duplicate cell culture supernatants were assessed by plaque assay and plotted as
percentage inhibition compared to 0.1% DMSO control. Error bars indicate SD. Dashed line indicates 50%
inhibition. A representative of two independent experiments is shown. Vero E6 cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of (C) berberine or (D) obatoclax or 0.1% DMSO control. 24h post-treatment, ATP
content in cells from triplicate wells was measured as indication for cell viability, plotted as percentage
compared to the DMSO control. Error bars indicate SD. A representative of two independent experiments is
shown.
