Abstract
Mathematical models are being used extensively in the study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
dynamics, becoming an essential tool for decision making concerning disease control. It is
now required to understand the mechanisms involved in the interaction between the
virus

and

the

immune

response

cells,

both

innate

and

adaptive,

in

order

to

support lines of research related to the use of drugs, production of protective antibodies
and of course, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The present study, using a system dynamic
approach,

hypothesizes

over

the

conditions

that

characterize

the

fraction

of

the

population which get infected by SARS-CoV-2 as the asymptomatic patients, the mild
symptomatic, acute symptomatic, and also super-spreaders, in terms of innate immune
response, the initial virus load, the virus burden with shedding events, and the cytokine
levels.

When an infected person expels virus-laden droplets and someone else inhales them, the

organs and tissues. As the virus multiplies, an infected person may shed copious amounts
of it, especially during the first week or so. Symptoms may be absent at this point. Or the
virusâ€™ new victim may develop a fever, dry cough, sore throat, loss of smell and taste, or
head and body aches. If the immune system doesnâ€™t beat back SARS-CoV-2 during this
initial phase, the virus then marches down the windpipe to attack the lungs, where it can
turn deadly. The thinner, distant branches of the lungâ€™s respiratory tree end in tiny air sacs

This series of events can be explained taking into account that during an infection, the
innate immunity is the first to be triggered (the inflammatory reaction), taking no longer
than minutes to hours to be fully activated

Mathematical model
The

present

model

consists

of

two

components,

the

first

one

corresponds

to

the

interaction between two populations, the immune cells and the virus SARS-CoV-2; the
second part

corresponds

to Cytokine release

as a response

to the

antigenic stimulus

induced by the interaction between the immune system and SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Two species interaction
This is a two populations model where

and



represent, respectively, the immune cells

and virus populations at time t= 14 days, which corresponds to the Incubation period

10

(from infection to symptoms). Following Lauer et. al.

, the median incubation period is

estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop
symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates
imply

that,

under

conservative

assumptions,

101

out

of

every

10

000

cases

(99th

percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days (336 hours) of active monitoring or
quarantine.

In

constructing

a

model

of

the

interaction

of

the

two

populations,

the

following

assumptions are made.

1.

In the absence of the immune response, which could be innate immune response
(IIR) or adaptative immune response, the viral load grows at a rate proportional to
the current population; thus

The number of encounters between the immune cells and virus is proportional to
the product of their populations. Each of such encounters tends to promote the
growth of the immune cells, by clonal expansion, and to inhibit the growth of the
viral burden. Thus, the growth rate of the immune cells is increased by a term of
the form



 ,

while the growth rate of the viral burden is decreased by a term

, and Î² is a positive constant.

As a consequence of these assumptions, it is possible to obtain the set of equations

Appendix 1.

Results
The dynamic simulation of the differential equation model (1), (2) and (3), under the
conditions and parameters specified in

Table 1, which seeks to represent the interactions

between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune cells, gives rise to a series of interesting results. The

them is

the

conditions

that

determine

the

not of a

periodic behavior associated with the dynamics in time of the immune response effector

system (see

As can be seen in

is between 1 and 0.5 copies/ml. It is interesting to note that, with

copies/ml, virus shedding events occur

only when IIR= 0.1. The above provides an explanation for clinical observation related to
positive RT-PCR results in patients who have recovered from COVID-19
and collaborators

22,23,24

. Following Li

24

, the prolonged shedding of virus from recovered patients is obviously

not an isolated phenomenon, but an integral component of the interaction dynamics
between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune cells.

The numerical results seem to indicate that, with low viral loads, even if the individual
does not have an optimal IIR, it is possible not to develop COVID-19 disease, a fact that
evidently reinforces the benefits of the social distancing policies and hygiene measures
associated

with

the

use

of

mouthpieces,

among

others,

that

have

been

throughout the world.

It is also observed in

that if IIR=1, the infection does not progress from any viral

load equal to or less than 1. However, when

is greater than 1, it is found (

the results of the model related to cytokine concentrations at the end of 366 hours, and

makers to make scientifically

recommendations.

Limitations
Some limitations of the study are the following. First, it is assumed that the interaction
between viral particles and immune response effecting cells is of a symmetrical nature,
when in fact it is mediated by the invasion of the virus into the epithelial cells of the lungs,
which generates the stimulus that causes their interaction with the immune cells. On the
other hand, it is assumed that the innate immune response acts as a simple characteristic
function, which oversimplifies the chain of events related to the non-specific response,

Conclusions
