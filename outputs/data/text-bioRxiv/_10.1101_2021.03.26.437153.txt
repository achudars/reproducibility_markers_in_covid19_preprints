Abstract
Many SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern has been reported recently which were linked
to increased transmission. In our earlier study on virus shedding using VOC
202012/01(UK variant) and D614G variant in hamster model, we observed significantly
higher viral RNA shedding through nasal wash in case of UK variant. Hence, we
compared the transmission of both the UK and D614G variant by various routes in
Syrian hamsters to understand whether the high viral RNA shedding could enhance the
transmission efficiency of the variant. The current study demonstrated comparable
transmission efficiency of both UK and D614G variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian
hamsters.

Main Text
SARS-CoV-2 virus has accumulated numerous genetic changes on circulation
all over the world. Some of these mutations have the potential to change the virus
characteristics like infectiousness, transmissibility, severity of disease and can have
impact on diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics 1. SARSCoV-2 variant with a D614G
substitution which emerged in the first quarter of the year 2020 supplanted the initial
SARS-CoV-2 strain showing its increased fitness to become the dominant strain
circulating globally. Recently, many variants of concern (VOC) were reported from
United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil etc. which were linked to increased transmission,
disease severity and vaccine escape mutants 2. To categorize a variant as VOC, various
risk elements like increased transmissibility, morbidity, mortality, immunity escape
factors needs to be studied. Scanty information is available on these aspects about the
variants.
In our earlier study on virus shedding using VOC 202012/01(UK variant) and
D614G variant in hamster model, we observed significantly higher viral RNA shedding
through nasal wash in case of UK variant 3. Direct contact, aerosol and fomite routes of
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established in hamster model 4. Here we have
compared the transmission of both the UK and D614G variant by various routes in
Syrian hamsters to understand whether the high viral RNA shedding through nasal
cavity in hamsters infected with UK variant could enhance the transmission efficiency
of the variant.
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics and Biosafety
Committee of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) -National Institute of
Virology (NIV), Pune and all the experiments were performed as per the institute

guidelines. The study was performed in the containment facility with a total of 36 male
hamsters of 6-8 week age housed in individually ventilated cages. Nine hamsters each
were intranasally infected with two SARS-CoV-2 variants i.e., UK variant (hCoV19/India/NIVP1 20203522/2020) and D614G variant (hCoV-19/India/2020770/2020)
with 0.1 ml of virus of 105.5 TCID50/ml under isoflurane anaesthesia and were used as
donor hamsters for studying transmission via direct contact, aerosol and fomite routes
5,6

. All the experiments were performed in triplicates for both the variants. SARS-CoV-

2 genomic RNA (gRNA) load were tested in the nasal wash, throat swab and faeces of
the contact hamsters on every alternate day till 14 days post exposure (DPE) using
quantitative real-time RT-PCR for E gene as described earlier 7. Virus titration was also
performed for the nasal wash samples in Vero CCL81 cells. The donor hamsters
infected with UK variant showed progressive weight loss with the maximum average
weight loss of 11 ± 2.82 % [mean ± standard deviation(S.D)] on day 6 whereas the
donor hamsters infected with D614G variant showed a maximum average weight loss of
-6.66± 1.36 % on day 8. The donor hamsters showed regain of weight thereafter. All
the donor hamsters, bedding, cage surfaces and water bottle nozzle samples from cages
used for fomite transmission study were tested for gRNA to ensure the presence of the
virus before exposure (Table 1).
Twenty four hour post infection, 3 donor hamsters were co-housed with a naive
hamster (referred to as contact hamster further) in 1: 1 ratio in a new cage to study
direct transmission and were observed till 14 DPE for body weight change and any
respiratory signs. The contact hamsters exposed with UK variant showed maximum
average weight loss of -2.93 ± 0.34 % and with D614G variant showed -4.8± 3.13 % on
8 DPE (Fig. 1A). The contact hamsters exposed with both variants showed viral gRNA
positivity in the samples from 2nd DPE and peak average viral gRNA load by 2nd to 4th

DPE (Figure 1B-D). This is similar to the pattern of detection reported in intranasal
inoculated hamsters with both variants

. Titration of nasal wash samples showed

consistent presence of virus till 10DPE with comparable titre in hamsters exposed with
both variants (Fig. 1E).
As the direct contact transmission, could be contributed by aerosol and fomites,
we assessed these routes of transmission alone. To assess the aerosol transmissibility,
SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster after 24 hours post infection was co-housed in a
modified individual ventilated cage with partition (which allows airflow) with a naive
hamster for 8 hours. The contact hamsters were housed in new cages and were observed
for 14 days. One hamster from the aerosol contact group of D614G variant did not show
any body weight loss and showed very low or negligible amount of viral RNA load in
the samples. The other hamsters of the aerosol contact group of UK variant and D614G
variant showed a peak average weight loss of -8.9% on 8 DPE and -4.2% on 10 DPE
respectively (Fig. 1A). The viral gRNA detection was observed from 2nd DPE and the
average viral gRNA peak detection in the nasal wash and faeces was observed on 6
DPE for hamsters exposed with both variants and higher viral load till 10 days (Fig. 1BD). The TCID50/ml of the nasal wash samples from 6 to 10DPE showed higher titres
(Fig.1E).
For the fomite transmission study, 3 naive hamsters were housed in different
cages with soiled bedding of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamster housed for 48 hours
following infection. A progressive decrease in body weight till 14 days was observed in
fomite contact hamsters of both the variants (Fig. 1A). The peak average viral gRNA in
fomite contact hamsters varied from 6 to 8 DPE in case of UK variant and 4 to 6 DPE
with D614G variant (Fig 1B-D). This is in contrary to an earlier study which reported
less efficient fomite transmission by SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters 4. Even though viral

gRNA could be detected till 14DPE, live virus particles could not be detected from
6DPE in case of D614G variant contacts in contrast to UK variant contacts where it
could be detected till 10DPE (Fig.1E) .
The virus detection in contact hamsters were seen as early as on 2nd DPE for
both variants indicating faster transmission and a maximum infectious period of 10 days
by all routes. The peak viral gRNA levels were comparable among different
transmission routes whereas the peaks of detection by the aerosol and fomite route were
found extended and with more variations among contact animals. The percent body
weight loss also varied among different routes of transmission. This could be due to
difference in the amount of virus dose exposure by these routes. Earlier research have
shown that lower and higher dose of virus inoculums show comparable viral gRNA
loads in hamsters but the lung lesions and body weight loss vary with virus dose 3,9.
IgG antibodies could be detected in all the donor and contact animals by an antiSARS CoV-2 IgG ELISA on 21 DPE except one contact hamster of the D614G variant
contact of the aerosol group which showed negligible viral gRNA load10. The day wise
comparison of the body weight loss and the viral shedding pattern in contact hamsters
by both variants on Mann-Whitney test did not show any statistical significance. Also
the comparison of different routes of transmission by each variant on Kruskal Wallis
test also did not show any statistical significance.
In conclusion, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants could be established in
Syrian hamsters by direct, aerosol and fomite routes as evident by the body weight loss,
detection of viral gRNA/live virus in the samples and IgG antibodies in the contact
hamsters. The study demonstrated comparable transmission efficiency of both UK and
D614G variants of SARS-CoV-2 in Syrian hamsters.
