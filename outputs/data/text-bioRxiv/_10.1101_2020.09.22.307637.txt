WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
Abstract

28
29

The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress

30

Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic

31

stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor. Current pathogenic event

32

models focus on past, and largely direct, trauma exposure to certain kinds of life-

33

threatening events. Nevertheless, among a sample of online participants (N = 1,040) in five

34

western countries, we found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not

35

happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly

36

exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely

37

PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 “exposure” (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5

38

criteria. The emotional impact of “worst” experienced/anticipated events best predicted

39

PTSD-like symptoms. Our findings add to existing literature supporting a pathogenic event

40

memory model of traumatic stress.

WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR

45

Why the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic stressor
The COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging all areas of human life (e.g., social,

46

financial), creating distress, and exacerbating mental health issues (1). Recent research

47

suggests that traumatic stress reactions during the pandemic—including intrusive re-

48

experiencing and heightened arousal—are particularly prevalent (2). But exposure to the

49

pandemic does not fit neatly within prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

50

models (pathogenic event models) (3,4). These models, along with the DSM-5 diagnostic

51

criteria (5), attribute traumatic stress reactions to past, and largely direct, exposure to

52

certain life-threatening events, and thus do not readily account for the emerging data. We

53

propose that people’s traumatic stress reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic may relate

54

more to: the future than the past; indirect (e.g., via media coverage) than direct (e.g.,

55

contact with the virus) exposure; and stressful events (e.g., unemployment, isolation, non-

56

sudden illness/death) that do not meet Criterion A (i.e., actual or threatened death, injury or

57

sexual violation). Therefore, we sought evidence for this proposal. Although we know

58

traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events

59

exist (6,7), the COVID-19 pandemic gives us a unique opportunity to extend this research

60

by considering all three factors simultaneously. Our goal was not to unnecessarily

61

pathologize normal transient stress reactions (8), but rather to document types of “events”

62

that lead to traumatic stress reactions and thus inform PTSD models which may—

63

currently—not capture all people who require help for traumatic stress symptoms.

64

We first turn to the idea of traumatic stress as a problem of the past. Existing PTSD

65

models largely focus on traumatic stress as a problem that occurs in response to past, not

66

future, events. Perhaps there is a profound ontological distinction between something that

67

has happened in the past and something that might happen in the future. Yet, Addis (9 p.

68

233) argues that remembering and imagining are “fundamentally the same process” (see

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.22.307637; this version posted September 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this

69

also 10); both involve the mental rendering of experience. Certainly, there is convincing

70

evidence that similar neural networks underlie remembering the past and imagining the

71

future (11). Thus, it is possible that problematic reactions can occur in response to any

72

mentally rendered experience, whether it is remembered and/or imagined. Existing

73

evidence fits with this idea: imagining future trauma—e.g., among soldiers before

74

deployment, expectant mothers, or people anticipating the death of a loved one—can cause

75

PTSD-related symptoms and distress at similar or higher levels than for past trauma (6,12–

76

14). Indeed, participants in these studies have reported—on scales adapted from traditional

77

PTSD measures—experiencing not only more typical symptom candidates like image-

78

based flashforwards to a specific future event, but also nonspecific symptom candidates

79

such as heightened irritability and negative mood. Therefore, traumatic stress symptoms

80

may be a problem of anticipating the future, as well as a reaction to something in the past

81

(6,13,14). Given the unknown timeline of COVID-19, it seems especially likely that

82

PTSD-like symptoms could arise due to anticipating any number of negative future events

83

(e.g., loved ones becoming sick) associated with the virus, particularly in the early weeks

84

of the pandemic (when the current data were collected). Moreover, given COVID-19 is

85

still unfolding, people may experience peri-traumatic reactions (responses at the time of a

86

stressful event or immediately after).

87

We now examine the idea of traumatic stress arising only from direct exposure to a

88

trauma. Criterion 4A of the DSM-5 states that some types of indirect trauma exposure,

89

such as exposure to others’ traumatic experiences (termed “vicarious trauma” e.g., first

90

responders collecting human remains), can result in PTSD symptomology (5). However,

91

this criterion does not apply when this exposure occurs via electronic media—unless this

92

exposure is work related (e.g., police officers repeatedly exposed to child exploitation

93

images). Yet, PTSD symptomology is also found among members of the general public

94

who are exposed only to traumatic material, usually via news media. For example, media

95

exposure was associated with higher acute stress than direct exposure to the Boston

96

Marathon bombings (15). In China, nurses not involved in caring for COVID-19 patients

97

(non-front-line nurses) and the general public had higher PTSD-like symptoms (e.g.,

98

intrusive thoughts), depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and physiological reactions

99

(e.g., no appetite), than front-line nurses (16). Li et al. (16) speculated that perhaps non-

100

front-line nurses and the general public consumed more COVID-19 media. Recent

101

evidence supports this interpretation: exposure to COVID-19 related news in the initial

102

stages of the outbreak was associated with negative affect, anxiety, depression and stress

103

(17). Moreover, searching for additional information about COVID-19 via traditional and

104

social media was related to increased fear about consequences of the virus (18). Therefore,

105

it seems possible that indirect exposure to the pandemic, such as via the 24-hour news

106

cycle, could produce PTSD-like symptoms.

107

Last, we turn to the idea of traumatic stress arising only from exposure to actual or

108

threatened death, serious injury or sexual violation (i.e., only to certain kinds of serious

109

events). Under the current diagnostic criteria, traumatic stress symptoms following events

110

that do not involve an immediate threat to life or physical injury—such as divorce, job

111

loss, or non-sudden medical events—do not qualify as PTSD. Yet, we know PTSD

112

symptoms arise after a range of events that do not meet this narrow definition (7). For

113

example, ongoing financial stressors and low social support following Hurricane Katrina,

114

not only direct exposure to hurricane-related events, were associated with PTSD symptoms

115

measured 18-24 months post-hurricane (19). Notably, financial stressors independently

116

predicted PTSD symptom duration, while hurricane-related traumatic events did not.

117

Further, 6-20% of cancer sufferers and their families are diagnosed with cancer-related

118

PTSD (20)—although the true prevalence of cancer-related PTSD is likely much higher.

WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
119

The moment when cancer is diagnosed—i.e., the traumatic “event”—often does not meet

120

DSM-5 criteria specifying a “sudden and catastrophic” medical event, and commonly

121

reported intrusive symptoms would not count because they relate to the future (e.g., fear of

122

relapse), not the past (20). Thus, direct exposure to a past event that threatens death, injury,

123

or sexual violation is not the only precipitator of PTSD-like symptoms. Again, these data

124

suggest that a range of COVID-19 related stressful events (e.g., job loss, isolation) could

125

lead to traumatic stress symptoms, despite even the direst of COVID-19 events not meeting

126

stringent DSM-5 criteria that state medical events must be sudden and “catastrophic” (5).

127

In summary, we predicted that people would report experiencing pre-, post-, and

128

peri-traumatic stress reactions in response to COVID-19, regardless of whether they had

129

been directly (e.g., COVID-19 diagnosis) or indirectly (e.g., media) exposed to the virus,

130

or had other negative experiences (e.g., lockdown). We were specifically interested in

131

people’s psychological, not immunological, response to the virus. We expected that

132

pre/peri/post-traumatic stress reactions, as well as other psychological functioning

133

indicators (well-being, psychosocial impairment, emotions, depression, anxiety, and stress)

134

would fluctuate alongside COVID-19 exposure, and that psychological functioning would

135

vary by demographics (e.g., age, healthcare).

136

We recruited online participants from five English speaking western countries of

137

similar socio-economic make up (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and

138

New Zealand). To date, research on COVID-19 as a traumatic stressor has primarily been

139

conducted in China (2), and only one unpublished study has focused on one of our

140

populations of interest (United States (21)). Participants indicated what COVID-19 events

141

they had experienced and what future events they were concerned about (see

142

Supplementary Online Material), and of these, which event bothered/bothers them the most

143

and why. We also measured COVID-19 media consumption. Participants completed the

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5 (22)), adapted to measure pre/peri/post-

145

traumatic reactions, and measures of general emotional reactions, well-being, psychosocial

146

functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Importantly, although emerging

147

research on COVID-19 and traumatic stress reactions has typically not specified whether

148

participants anchored their reactions to COVID-19 itself (e.g., (23)), we asked our

149

participants to respond to the PCL-5 in relation to COVID-19.

took the survey twice. Thus, after exclusions, we collected 260 participants in each of four

locations (Australia/NZ combined for analysis; a participant error resulted in 261

162

participants from Canada, and 259 from Australia/NZ), from Mechanical Turk (MTurk; n

164

sample size (N = 1,000). We know that MTurk data are reliable (25,26) and sometimes

165

even superior to university sourced participants (e.g., participants fail fewer attention

166

checks (27)). Prolific data appear to be as reliable as MTurk, and similar, if not superior to,

167

university research pools (28). Further, the prevalence of mental health disorders in MTurk

168

populations matches or exceeds that of the general population (29), suggesting MTurk is an

excellent source for collecting clinical and subclinical populations. We specifically abide

170

by Mellis and Bickel’s (30) advice for conducting online research, to mitigate concerns in

171

these populations (e.g., non-naivete, worker inattention, fraudulent responses and worker

172

treatment). To minimize “bots”/server farmers completing the survey (31,32), participants

173

had to pass a captcha, a simple arithmetic question (presented as an image to make it

174

difficult for bots to read), and score at least 8/10 on an English proficiency test. We are

175

confident that these entry requirements screened out almost all bots/server farmers; in one

176

estimate, the addition of an English proficiency test screened out 96% of bots/server

177

farmers (33). In addition to these entry requirements, participants had to pass at least one

178

of three attention check questions embedded in the survey itself to be included in the final

179

sample (34,35).

180

Participants ranged from 18-78 years (M = 35.7, SD = 12.3), half were male

181

(50.70%, female = 48.8%, non-binary = 0.4%; 0.2% did not answer) and most were

182

Caucasian 59.9%. Others were of Asian (13.4%); African (including “Black”, 4.7%);

183

Middle Eastern (including “Eurasian”, 0.8%); European (3.5%); and Hispanic (1.2%)

184

descent, or Indigenous (0.3%); Pacific Islander (0.1%); Mixed (3.3%) ethnicity. Some

185

participants provided nationality (e.g., “Australian” 12.8%) or no answer (0.2%). Seventy

186

percent were employed, 19.8% were students. Participants’ highest level of education was

187

a college/university undergraduate degree (54.8%), postgraduate degree (18.7%), high

188

school (25.6%); 1.0% < high school. Participants had a median of three people in their

189

household (including themselves). Modal household income was (local currency):

190

Australia/NZ = $100,000-$149,999, Canada = $100,000-$149,000, UK = £20,000-

191

£29,999, US = $50,000-$59,999. Most participants (88.8%) had health-care coverage for

192

COVID-19 expenses and were not in a high-risk group (82.6%) for developing COVID-19

(e.g., elderly, medical condition; 14.9% of participants identified as high risk, 2.5% did not

194

know). Just under half (45.2%) had experienced a Criterion A event.

195

Materials

196

We first asked demographic questions, described above. Note that other pre-

197

registered measures (i.e., media avoidance, engagement with fictional/non-fictional media,

198

perceptions of sharing the pandemic with others) are not reported here.

199

General emotional reactions. We assessed current stress (0 = no stress, 10 = worst

200

stress possible), and, when thinking about COVID-19, how intensely participants felt

201

negative emotions (sad, angry, anxious, frustrated, helpless, fearful, disgusted; 0 = not at

202

all, 7 = extremely). We averaged these emotion items (α = .89).

203

Exposure to COVID-19 and related impact. We provided a list of 32 COVID-19

204

related events (ranging from exposure to the virus itself to stressors like job loss; see

205

Appendix: https://osf.io/tkemz/), within nine predetermined categories. Participants

206

selected all the events they had experienced, with an option for ‘other’ leading us to create

207

four additional––and modify 10––categories. We recategorized seven “other” responses

208

into new categories and 37 into modified/existing categories. We then re-presented the

209

same list of events, but asked participants to select events they were concerned about

210

happening in the future (“other” events led to three additional categories [seven responses

211

recategorized] and eight modified categories [15 recategorized]). For both lists,

212

participants identified which of their selected events bothered them the most and why (text

213

response), and how much it bothered them emotionally (1 = not at all, 5 = very much).

214

Media exposure. Participants identified the social media (e.g., Facebook) and news

215

media (e.g., television) sources used to engage with COVID-19 content. We assessed

216

frequency of use (how many: hours in the past day, days in the past week, average hours in

217

the past week), and combined these items to create a score for both media types.

The PTSD Checklist (PCL-5 (22)). Participants rated how much they have been

218
219

bothered by 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms (e.g., “having difficulty concentrating”; 0 = not at

220

all, 4 = extremely; current study α = .92). We made three modifications: measured

221

symptoms in relation to COVID-19 experiences, over the past week (rather than month)

222

due to the rapidly changing circumstances, and asked participants to indicate if each

223

symptom (rated > 0) related to something that happened in the past, was currently

224

happening, or may happen in the future.

226

Participants rated how five statements (e.g., “I have felt calm and relaxed”) applied to them

227

over the past week (0 = at no time, 5 = all of the time). Total scores (0-25) are multiplied

228

by four to provide a percentage score (0 = worst possible quality of life, 100 = best

229

possible quality of life; current study: α = .90).

230

Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (B-IPF (37)). Participants rated

231

how much (0 = not at all, 6 = very much) trouble they have had with seven impairment

232

domains (e.g., work) over the past week (e.g., “I had trouble at work”; current study: α =

233

.85).

234

Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21 (38)). Participants rated the

235

degree to which each statement (e.g., “I felt down-hearted and blue”) applied to them over

236

the past week (0 = did not apply to me at all, 3 = applied to me very much). Current study:

237

Depression, α = .92; Anxiety, α = .86; Stress, α = .90.

Minister Johnson was released after hospitalization for COVID-19, the Queen addressed

244

the nation, and lockdown restrictions were extended. In Canada, deaths reached 1,500, and

245

an unrelated shooting occurred in Nova Scotia. In Australia/NZ, lockdown procedures

246

were introduced or maintained, and both countries showed signs of reduced COVID-19

spread from the first wave.

248

We ran analyses using Null-Hypothesis Significance Tests (α = .05) in SPSS

249

Version 25 and JASP for MacOS version 0.13.1 (39). Where data were missing, we used

250

the average mean score from the appropriate subscale. In total there were only six missing

251

data points from five participants: two participants missed items on the Posttraumatic

252

Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5; one participant missed two items), two participants

253

missed one item on the WHO-5 (measure of wellbeing), and one participant missed one

254

item on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21).

These variables were highly correlated. According to the conservative cut-off for

263

clinical significance for PCL-5 scores (< 32 = negative, ≥ 33 = positive) (40), 13.2% of our

264

participants could be classified PTSD-positive. For depression, 47.3% of our participants

were in the normal range; 28.8% mild-moderate; 24.0% severe-extremely severe

some impairment due to COVID-19. Completing day-to-day activities (e.g., chores,

273

medical appointments; self-care subscale: 62.8%) was most common. Troubles with

274

training/education (27.6%) created the highest level of impairment (M = 3.3, SD = 1.7).

275

Taken together, our findings support emerging research that COVID-19 can be

276

understood as a traumatic stressor event capable of causing PTSD-like responses and

277

exacerbating other related mental health problems. Thus, next we addressed our main

278

aim—to examine evidence for our proposal that people are experiencing traumatic stress

279

symptoms as a result of COVID-19 because direct exposure to a past event that threatens

280

death, injury, or sexual violation, is not the only circumstance capable of precipitating

281

PTSD-like symptoms.

282

First, we examined evidence that traumatic stress is a problem not only of

283

remembering the past, but also of anticipating the future. We calculated the frequency of

284

exposure to experienced and anticipated COVID-19 events. On average, participants

285

anticipated (M = 8.98, SD = 5.24) more events than they had experienced (M = 6.34, SD =

286

2.74; d = 0.49). The most common worst experiences were being in lockdown (13.1%),

287

trouble obtaining supplies (11.2%), and voluntarily self-isolating (10.8%). The most

288

common worst anticipated experience was close family/friends passing away (38.1%),

289

followed by becoming ill or passing away (22.2%), and close family/friends testing

290

positive (9.2%). However, worst anticipated and experienced event judgements were fairly

291

evenly distributed across our full list.

292

We next examined whether traumatic stress reactions were associated with

293

anticipated (and experienced) events. We found small correlations between PTSD-like

294

symptoms and total experienced (r = .20, p < .001) and anticipated (r = .23 p < .001)

295

events. Both exposure measures weakly correlated with other stress and psychological

296

functioning measures (experienced: rs = .10-.19; anticipated: rs = .12-.22).

14
WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
297

However, because examining event totals tells us nothing about how distressing

298

each experienced/anticipated event was, we next focused on our nine event categories, and

299

participants' worst experienced and anticipated events. Participants who had contact with

300

the virus (d = 0.34, 95% CI [0.20, 0.47]), lost work/income (d = 0.18 [0.05, 0.30]),

301

experienced lockdown directives (d = 0.13 [0.004, 0.25]), changes to children/dependents

302

(d = 0.15 [0.02, 0.28]), and had trouble buying supplies (d = 0.34 [0.22, 0.46]) reported

303

higher PTSD symptoms than participants not reporting these experiences. However, there

304

was no difference based on whether people experienced changes to work/education, travel

305

plans, closure of non-essential gatherings, or voluntarily self-isolated (ds 0.02 - 0.11).

306

Similarly, participants who anticipated contact with the virus (d = 0.44, 95% CI [0.15,

307

0.72]), losing work/income (d = 0.25 [0.12, 0.37]), lockdown directives (d = 0.15 [0.03,

308

0.28]) and changes to children/dependents (d = 0.35 [0.18, 0.51]) had higher PTSD

309

symptoms than participants who did not anticipate these events. Contrary to experienced

310

events, participants who anticipated changes to work/education (d = 0.38, [0.16, 0.61]),

311

travel plans (d = 0.26 [0.12, 0.40]), and closure of non-essential gatherings (d = 0.29 [0.07,

312

0.50]) reported higher PTSD symptoms than participants who did not anticipate these

313

events. There was no difference based on whether people anticipated voluntarily self-

314

isolating (d = 0.24 [0.01, 0.46]), or having trouble buying supplies (d = 0.12 [-0.02, 0.25]).

315

On average, participants' worst anticipated event (M = 3.97, SD = 1.04) was more

316

emotionally bothersome than their worst experienced event (M = 3.35, SD = 1.15; two-

317

tailed paired samples: t (1039) = -18.18, p <.001, d = 0.56, 95% CI [0.50, 0.63]). Both

318

ratings strongly correlated with PTSD symptoms (experienced: r = .48; anticipated: r =

319

.45) and other stress and psychological functioning measures (experienced: rs .30-.51;

320

anticipated: rs .25 - .46). However, total PCL score does not tell us how often participants

321

attributed symptoms to experienced and anticipated events, or something currently

322

happening. Nearly half (48.1%) of participants reported symptoms in relation to all time

323

periods (23.3% past/future, 7.5% past/current, 0.8% past/future; 14.5% current, 0.2% past,

324

1.7% future; 3.9% reported no symptoms). Some participants failed to index individual

325

symptoms to a timeframe; 0.6% did not index any. Notably, 73.5% of participants reported

326

at least one symptom related to something that had not happened. These symptoms fell into

327

all four symptom clusters (50.1% of participants attributed intrusion symptoms to the

328

future; 15.4% avoidance, 48.0% hyperarousal and 56.5% cognition and mood). In other

329

words, PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not yet happened did not only manifest as

330

intrusive thoughts (which might be narrowly conceptualized as worries about the future)

331

but also as nonspecific symptoms such as irritability and alertness.

332

Second, we examined whether traumatic stress reactions occurred regardless of

333

direct versus indirect exposure to COVID-19. Participants reporting PTSD symptoms in

334

relation to future events already supports this prediction. In addition, we found small

335

correlations between COVID-19 related social media consumption (r = .18, p < .001) and

336

PTSD symptoms, and all psychological functioning variables (rs = .09 - .20) except well-

337

being; and between traditional media consumption and PTSD symptoms (r = .12, p <

338

.001), stress, and negative emotions (rs = .14, p < .001), but not other psychological

339

functioning variables. Although small, considering the average adult spends three hours

340

and 30 minutes a day on a mobile device—equating to 53 days in a year and countless

341

exposure to news media (43)—these effects could rapidly accumulate, leading to adverse

342

consequences (44).

343

Third, we examined evidence that PTSD-like symptoms occur for events that do

344

not involve actual or threatened death, injury, or sexual violation. Arguably, none of our

345

events/categories meet Criterion A; medically-based trauma is limited to sudden

346

catastrophe (e.g., waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock (5)). Even our most extreme

16
WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
347

direct exposure variables (e.g., being hospitalized in a critical condition) do not qualify.

348

Therefore, it is troubling that 13.2% of participants could be classified as PTSD-positive

349

when anchoring the PCL-5 to COVID-19. We explored whether PTSD-positive

350

participants had direct exposure to the virus via events which, while not classed as

351

Criterion A, could be life threatening. Direct exposure included personally testing positive

352

or being hospitalized as a result of COVID-19, or suspecting you may have been exposed

353

to the virus, or knowing close others (e.g., family/friends) who have tested positive, were

354

hospitalized, or who have passed away, as a result of COVID-19. More participants who

355

had some form of direct virus exposure (n = 327) were PTSD-positive (16.5%), than

356

participants who had no virus exposure (n = 713; PTSD-positive = 11.6%). But

357

participants who were not directly exposed to the virus accounted for more (8%) of the

358

PTSD-positive participants (χ² (1) = .031, φ = .067). Additionally, there was no difference

359

in the percentage of PTSD-positive participants who had experienced (6.8%) or not (6.3%)

360

a Criterion A event previously, suggesting participants anchored PCL-5 responses to

361

COVID-19 experiences rather than other lifetime traumas.

362

Together, these data support our proposal that PTSD-like reactions can occur in

363

relation to past, ongoing, and future stress events, indirect stress event exposure, and for a

364

variety of stressors not covered by Criterion A. To examine the relative contribution of our

365

exposure variables, while also controlling for demographic variables that could increase

366

participants’ susceptibility to PTSD symptoms, we regressed PCL-5 total on these

367

variables. For all regression analyses, tolerance and variance inflation factors showed

368

multicollinearity was not an issue.

369

First, we examined which demographic variables related to PTSD-like reactions.

370

PCL-5 total scores were higher for females (d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.29, 0.54]), students (d =

371

0.16, [0.01, 0.32]), people at high risk of contracting COVID-19 (d = 0.30, [0.14, 0.46]),

372

and people with lifetime Criterion A trauma (d = 0.31, [0.18, 0.43]), and were weakly

373

correlated with age and income (rs <.10). Age, household income, sex, risk status, and

374

prior Criterion A exposure, best predicted PCL-5 total (7.9% of the variance; F(6, 1031) =

375

15.68, p <.001).

376

To examine the unique additional variance explained by actual and anticipated

377

exposure to COVID-19 (event totals), media consumption (social and traditional media

378

summed), and the emotion associated with worst events (experienced and anticipated), we

379

reran the regression with demographic variables entered at Step 1, exposure variables at

380

Step 2, and emotion variables at Step 3. After controlling for demographics, exposure

381

variables explained an additional 7.8% of the variance in PCL-5 total (Fchange (3, 1019) =

382

31.86, p <.001). Importantly, emotion associated with worst events explained an additional

383

16.7% of the variance in PCL-5 total (Fchange (2, 1017) = 126.78, p <.001; regression

384

coefficients and standard errors appear in Table 2). The final model explained 32.4% of the

385

variance in PCL total (F (10, 1027) = 50.23, p <.001), and, notably, experienced event

386

totals was no longer a significant predictor.

19
WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
393

Overall, we found that participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had

394

not yet happened, challenging the nature of traumatic stress as a problem pertaining only to

395

the past. Participants reported these reactions whether they had been directly (e.g.,

396

COVID-19 diagnosis) or indirectly exposed (e.g., via media) to COVID-19, challenging

397

the idea that people need to experience a direct, in person event to develop PTSD-like

398

symptoms. Finally, 13.2% of our sample were PTSD-positive, despite COVID-19

399

“exposure” not fitting within Criterion A. The emotion associated with participants’ worst

400

experienced and anticipated events predicted PTSD-like symptoms beyond demographic

401

and exposure variables, suggesting that subjective evaluations of emotional impact may be

402

more important in determining traumatic stress reactions than individual characteristics or

403

objective levels of exposure.

404

Dominant pathogenic event models focus on PTSD arising for specific kinds of

405

external events, and emphasize factors during/after encoding, including differential

406

processing for perceptual (e.g., sensory) versus conceptual (e.g., meaning) details, and poor

407

integration of the trauma in autobiographical memory (3,4). Thus, they do not account for

408

symptoms in response to anticipated events, indirect exposure to trauma, or events that do

409

not meet Criterion A. Our findings fit instead with a pathogenic event memory model,

410

which accounts for traumatic stress in response to future and/or imagined events (45).

411

Of course, an alternative explanation of our data for anticipated events is that they

412

simply reflect people expressing distress—including negative or threatening thoughts and

413

images—about potential threats looming in their future, which may reflect worry, or a

414

generalized anxiety disorder (5,46). Indeed, the PCL-Civilian—which is indexed to

415

“stressful life experiences” rather than a specific trauma—correlates highly with measures

416

of depression and general anxiety, suggesting that without the anchor to a specific trauma,

417

the PCL-5 may pick up negative emotionality more generally (47). However, we did ask

20
WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
418

people to indicate specific events that had happened to them, or that they were concerned

419

about happening in the future, and then index their symptoms in relation to COVID-19.

420

Therefore, it seems likely participants were thinking about specific COVID-19 related

421

events rather than unknown/non-specific future events.

422

Our findings may also reflect the “hedonic treadmill” (48), whereby mildly

423

stressful events feel more negative against the backdrop of relatively stress-free lives,

424

particularly in the context of data from western countries, as we measured here. This

425

explanation does not diminish that our participants were experiencing genuine distress, but

426

explains why exposure to events like government lockdowns and inability to source

427

supplies was associated with traumatic stress symptoms—and in some cases, above clinical

428

cut-off levels.

429

COVID-19’s psychological fallout has been dubbed the “second curve,” predicted

430

to last for months to years. Notably, while most of our participants reported experiencing

431

some form of psychological distress and 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD positive

432

when anchoring symptoms to COVID-19, only 2% of our total sample reported they had

433

personally tested positive to COVID-19, and only 5% reported that close family and

434

friends had tested positive. It therefore seems likely that the psychological fallout from

435

COVID-19 may reach further than the medical fallout. Short term, our findings highlight

436

the need to focus on the acute psychological distress—especially the perceived emotional

437

impact of particular events—associated with COVID-19. Our results also support the

438

WHO recommendation (49) to minimize consumption of COVID-19 media. Long-term,

439

comprehensive documentation of COVID-19 related traumatic stress reactions will allow

440

health professionals to help people who could otherwise fall through the cracks. Although

441

our data suggest that COVID-19 could be understood as a traumatic stressor, this

442

conceptualization might contribute to the problem of “conceptual bracket creep” (8). Thus,

21
WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
443

we must consider the difference between genuine symptoms of a disorder and normal

444

stress reactions. Failure to do so may undermine efforts to understand the psychological

445

mechanisms that contribute to PTSD symptoms.

446

Our research has limitations. First, we used the PCL-5, a self-report measure, to

447

examine PTSD-like symptoms cross-sectionally. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale

448

(CAPS-5 (50)) is a more comprehensive measure that identifies the frequency and intensity

449

of PTSD-like symptoms for an indexed event and allows a clinician to diagnose if PTSD

450

might be present. However, we wanted to capture PTSD-like symptoms in a large sample

451

across multiple locations that were at different points of the pandemic at the time, a goal

452

that could not be achieved using a clinician administered scale. Second, the CAPS-5 can

453

only be completed on clients who have experienced a Criterion A event. Here, our aim was

454

to examine traumatic stress reactions to any type of COVID-19 event that might produce

455

such symptoms, rather than events specifically falling within this category. Similarly, we

456

cannot determine whether symptom levels in our sample would qualify for a PTSD

457

diagnosis. Future research could use experience-sampling methods to capture longitudinal

458

symptoms, or a clinician administered scale to diagnose PTSD.

459

Second, our sample only examined five countries that were all Western, English

460

speaking countries similar in culture and socio-economic status. As such, we can only

461

cautiously generalize these findings to other parts of the world. Third, of course, although

462

our data provide evidence for the potential psychological fallout of the COVID-19

463

pandemic, we did not investigate any personality traits, or external factors such as social

464

support or other coping strategies, that might moderate this response. Finally, we only

465

asked participants to focus on negative outcomes of COVID-19; future research could

466

examine positive outcomes (e.g., growth, resilience).

22
WHY COVID-19 IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR
467

COVID-19 related traumatic stress symptoms expose weaknesses in dominant

468

PTSD models, which fail to account for traumatic stress reactions arising from anticipated,

469

indirect, or non-life threatening stressors. This study clearly demonstrates that a single

470

global event can lead to PTSD symptoms for a range of anticipated, indirect, and non-life

471
