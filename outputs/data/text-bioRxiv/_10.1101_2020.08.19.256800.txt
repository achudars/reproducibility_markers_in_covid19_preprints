Abstract

23

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China at the end of

24

2019, and became pandemic. The zoonotic virus most likely originated from bats, but definite

25

intermediate hosts have not yet been identified. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) are

26

kept for fur production, in particular in China, and were suspected as potential intermediate host

27

for both SARS-CoV6 and SARS-CoV2. Here we demonstrate susceptibility of raccoon dogs for

28

SARS-CoV-2 infection after intranasal inoculation and transmission to direct contact animals.

29

Rapid, high level virus shedding, in combination with minor clinical signs and pathohistological

30

changes, seroconversion and absence of viral adaptation highlight the role of raccoon dogs as a

31

potential intermediate host. The results are highly relevant for control strategies and emphasize

32

the risk that raccoon dogs may represent a potential SARS-CoV-2 reservoir. Our results support

33

the establishment of adequate surveillance and risk mitigation strategies for kept and wild

34

raccoon dogs.

Text

36

Coronaviruses can infect a wide variety of animals, and are responsible for human

37

diseases including severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS). Both SARS coronavirus (SARS-

38

CoV) (1, 2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (3, 4), are ß-

39

coronaviruses and presumably originate from bats (5). They likely adapted to other reservoir

40

hosts like Asian palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus) (6) and dromedary camels (Camelus

41

dromedarius) (7). Natural SARS-CoV infections were also detected in raccoon dogs

42

(Nyctereutes procyonoides) which, among other candidate species, have been discussed as a

43

possible intermediate host for the first SARS-pandemic of 2002/2003 (8).

44

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started from Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

45

Close relatives to SARS-CoV-2 were found in bats (9), and pangolins (Pholidota spp) (10, 11).

46

Furthermore, spill-over infections to different carnivores (dogs, cats, lions, tigers and minks)

47

were reported (12, 13). However, whether the pandemic started by a direct transmission of the

48

SARS-CoV-2 ancestor from bats to humans or via an intermediate mammalian host with further

49

adaptation, is still under debate (14). For both, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, intermediate hosts

50

played a crucial role in transmission to humans. However, no definite intermediate host for

51

SARS-CoV-2 has been identified up to now (14), but animal species like pangolins, palm civets,

52

or raccoon dogs are discussed (15–17). Although the pandemic is driven by direct human-to-

53

human transmission, case studies demonstrate that anthropo-zoonotic infections occurred by

54

contact of infected humans with companion animals and farmed minks kept for fur production in

55

the Netherlands, Denmark and Spain (13, 18, 19). There is also evidence for zoo-anthroponotic

56

infection of humans (13).

57

Natural infections of raccoon dogs with SARS-CoV were reported (8), indicating a

58

potential role in the previous SARS-CoV epidemic. In fact, 14.14 million captive raccoon dogs

59

held in China for fur production (20) represent 99% of the global share (Figure. S3A). However,

60

experimental infections of these animals with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 under controlled

61

conditions and serologic surveillance of kept or wild raccoon dogs have not been documented.

62
63

Since SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ the same receptor molecule ACE2 for
contact with the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein (21), a similar range of

64

susceptible host species can be assumed. Molecular studies indicate that the ACE2 proteins of

65

raccoon dogs can also serve as an efficient receptor for SARS-CoV (22) and SARS-CoV-2 (15).

66

Following a previously established study design (23) (Figure. 1A), we tested the

67

susceptibility of raccoon dogs to SARS-CoV-2. Nine animals were challenged by intranasal

68

inoculation of 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 2019_nCoV Muc-IMB-1, and 3 additional animals

69

were introduced at one day post-infection (dpi) to evaluate direct viral transmission.

70

Methods

71

Study design

72

Fourteen adult, male (n=4) and female (n=10) raccoon dogs originating from a

73

commercial farm were used. All animals were tested negative by RT-qPCR and antibody tests

74

(ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence assay iIFAT, virus neutralization test VNT) for SARS-

75

CoV-2 prior to the experiment. All raccoon dogs had been vaccinated against distemper, adeno-

76

and parvovirus (Eurican® SHP, Merial, France). Animals were kept in individual stainless-steel

77

cages (1.5m x 0.95m x 2.0m) in four separate segments at 20°C room temperature, 60-80%

78

humidity and a 12hr/12hr (35% dimming during night modus) lighting control within a fan

79

forced draught ventilation equipped BSL3** animal facility at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut

80

(FLI). Water was offered ad libitum. Animals were fed daily with 400 gr commercially produced

81

feed for farmed foxes and raccoon dogs (Schirmer und Partner GmbH Co KG, Germany;

82

Michael Hassel GmbH, Langenargen, Germany). The diet was supplemented with vitamins,

83

minerals and items like one-day old chickens as described before (24). The general health status

84

of all animals, feed uptake and defecation were recorded daily. The body weight and temperature

85

of all animals were measured prior to inoculation and at days 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 21, and 28 pi.

86

The outline of the experiments with an observation period of 28 days is depicted in

87

Figure 1. Nine raccoon dogs (3 males, 6 females) were infected intranasally with 105 TCID50

88

SARS-CoV-2 2019_nCoV Muc-IMB-1. The inoculum of 2x1ml was administered to both

89

nostrils using a pipette. To test viral transmission by direct contact, three naïve sentinel animals

90

(all female) were added 24 hours post inoculation. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were

91

taken at 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 21 and 28 days post infection (dpi), blood was taken at 4, 8, 12, 16, 21

92

and 28 dpi. Two animals each were sacrificed at day 0 (control #1, #2) day 4 (animals #1, #2),

93

day 8 (animals #3, #4) and day 12 pi (animals #5, #6). The remaining inoculated animals

94

(animals #7-9) and the contacts (animals #10-12) were euthanized 28 dpi. All animals were

95

subjected to autopsy for macroscopic evaluation and tissue sampling.

96

The animal experiments were evaluated and approved by the ethics committee of the State Office

97

of Agriculture, Food Safety, and Fishery in Mecklenburg – Western Pomerania (LALLF M-V:

98

LVL MV/TSD/7221.3-2-010/18-12).

99

Virus and cells

100

The virus was propagated once in Vero E6 cells in a mixture of equal volumes of Eagle

101

MEM (Hanks’ balanced salts solution) and Eagle MEM (Earle’s balanced salts solution)

102

supplemented with 2mM L-Glutamine, nonessential amino acids, adjusted to 850 mg/L,

103

NaHCO3, 120 mg/L sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), pH 7.2. No contaminants

104

were detected within the virus stock preparation by metagenomic analysis employing previously

105

published high throughput sequencing procedures Ion Torrent S5XL instrument (25, 26) and the

106

sequence identity of the passaged virus (study accession number: PRJEB39640) was confirmed.

107

The virus was harvested after 72 h, titrated on Vero E6 cells and stored at -80°C until further use.

109

RNA extraction and detection of SARS-CoV-2
Total RNA from nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swab samples, fecal samples as well as

110

from tissues taken at autopsy were extracted using the NucleoMagVet kit (Macherey&Nagel,

111

Düren, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues were homogenized in 1 ml

112

cell culture medium (see above) and a 5 mm steel bead in a TissueLyser (Qiagen, Hilden,

113

Germany). Fecal samples were vortexed in sterile NaCl and the supernatant was sterile filtered

114

(22µm) after centrifugation. Swab samples were transferred into 1 ml of serum-free tissue

115

culture media and further processed after 30 min shaking. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by

116

an E-gene based RT-qPCR (27) using the AgPath-ID-One-Step RT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher

117

Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) in a volume of 12.5 µl including 1 µl of ß-Actin-

118

mix2-HEX as internal control and 2.5 µl of extracted RNA. The reaction was performed as

119

described before (23). Nasal swab samples from raccoon dog #2 (2 dpi) and from contact animal

120

#10 (8 dpi) were subjected to high-throughput sequencing and compared to the inoculum (study

121

accession number: PRJEB39640) by employing previously published high throughput

122

sequencing procedures using Ion Torrent S5XL instrument (25, 26).

123

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies

124

Serum samples collected throughout the study were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2

125

reactive antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence assay (iIFA), virus neutralization test (VNT)

126

as described before (23). For ELISA, medium-binding ELISA plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH,

127

Germany) were coated with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (RBD-SD1 domain, amino acids 319 – 519 of the

128

SARS-CoV2 Spike ectodomain, for details see Appendix). The sera were diluted 1:100 in TBST

129

and incubated on the coated and uncoated wells for 1h at room temperature followed by three

130

washes using TBST. The saliva samples were used undiluted. Reactivity was shown by adding a

131

multi species conjugate (SBVMILK; IDvet, France) diluted 1:80 (serum) or 1:10 (saliva). After an

132

incubation period of 1 h at room temperature, the plates were washed again and

133

Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (IDEXX, Switzerland) was added. The ELISA readings

134

were taken at a wavelength of 450 nm on a Tecan Spectra Mini instrument (Tecan Group Ltd,

135

Switzerland). The measurements were normalized to the respective samples tested on wells treated

136

only with the coating buffer.

137

For comparison, sera were also tested in a newly developed commercial SARS-CoV-2 sVNT (28).

138

Briefly, 1:10 serum dilutions were incubated for 30 min at 37°C with HRP-coupled RBD before

139

transferring the samples to the capture plate pre-coated with the human ACE2 protein. After 15

140

min incubation at 37°C, plates were washed four times. TMB substrate was added and the plate

141

was incubated at room temperature for 15 min before stopping the reaction and reading the optical

142

density (OD) at 450 nm. Percent inhibition was calculated as (1- OD sample / OD negative control)

143

x 100.

144

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific immunoglobulins

145

SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins (Ig) were comparatively investigated in sera and saliva

146

of raccoon dogs by ELISA using exactly the same SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 antigen-coated plates,

147

serum dilutions, washing and dilution buffers, TMB substrate, incubation periods and ELISA-

Antibodies were diluted in TBST.

153

Virus titration

154

Virus titer used for infection experiments was confirmed by titration on Vero E6 cells (Biobank

155

Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, catalogue N° 0929) and evaluation of CPE after 5 days. RT-qPCR

156

positive swabs and tissue samples were titrated on Vero E6 cells as well

157

Autopsy, histopathology, immunohistochemistry

158

Full autopsy was performed on all animals under BSL3 conditions. A broad spectrum of tissues

159

was collected and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and trimmed for paraffin embedding,

160

including the upper and lower respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract, the urinary tract, brain,

161

and main parenchyma (see appendix for details). Tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 3 μm

162

sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopical examination. For SARS-

163

CoV-2 antigen detection was performed as described (25). Evaluation and interpretation of

164

pathology data were performed by a board-certified pathologist (DiplECVP). The severity of

165

lesions and the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was recorded on an ordinal scoring scale with

166

scores 0 = no lesion/antigen, 1 = rare, affected cells/tissue <5% per slide; 2 = multifocal, 6-40 %

167

affected; 3 = coalescing, 41-80% affected; 4 = diffuse, >80%affected.

168

Statistical information

169

All data were analyzed and visualized using GraphPad Prism Version 7.0 (GraphPad Software,

170

San Diego, CA, USA). No statistical methods were used.

172

Results

173

Inoculation led to productive infection in six out of nine exposed animals. Based on the

174

lack of viral RNA detection throughout the observation period of 28 days, we concluded that

175

infection of animals #4, #8 and #9 failed (Figure 1, panel B). While several animals showed

176

reduced overall activity at 4 dpi (animal #4, #5, #10), none of the exposed and contact animals

177

showed any obvious clinical sign of infection until the termination of the experiment. In particular,

178

neither increase in body temperature nor weight loss were observed.

179

Next, we examined the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus in nasal, oropharyngeal

180

and rectal swab samples as well as in feces by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT–qPCR)

181

and titration on Vero E6 cells. Raccoon dogs started to shed virus already at 2 dpi in nasal and

182

oropharyngeal swabs (Figure 2, panels A, B). While infectious virus was isolated from individual

183

animals up to 4 dpi (Figure. 2B), viral RNA was present in nasal swabs up to 16 dpi (animal #7,

184

Figure 2, panel C). Viral genome loads were highest in nasal swabs (mean genome copies

185

Log10/ml: 3.2, min: 1.0, max: 6.45), followed by oropharyngeal swabs (2.9; 0.54-4.39) and rectal

186

swabs (0.71; 0.31-1.38, Figure 2, panel A). Virus titrations revealed the same trend, with the

187

highest viral titres of up to 4.125 Log10 TCID50/ml in nasal swabs at 2 dpi. Infectious virus was

188

never isolated from rectal swabs. In general, virus isolation failed above quantification cycle (Cq)-

189

values of around 27 (Appendix Figure 1).

190

Virus was transmitted to two of three contact animals (#10, #11) (Figure 1, panel B, Figure

191

2, panel C). One contact raccoon dog (#12) remained negative due to the fact that both cage

192

neighbors (#8, #9, Figure 1, panel B), did not shed virus after inoculation. In contact animals, viral

193

RNA indicative of infection was first detected at 8 dpi (7 days post contact (dpc), #10). As in the

194

inoculated animals, excretion in contact animals was mainly via nasal secretions and lasted until

195

16 dpi (15 dpc) and virus isolation yielded viral titers of 1.625 Log10 TCID50/ml in nasal swabs

196

of one contact animal (#10) at 8 dpi (7 dpc).

197

Tissues and body fluids of euthanized animals were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-

198

2 RNA and replicating virus at day 4, 8, 12, and 28 pi (Figure 2, panel D). Highest viral genome

199

loads of up to 4.87 Log10 genome copies per ml were observed in samples from the oro-nasal

200

cavity, whereas only minute amounts were sporadically identified in other organs. The caudal,

201

olfactory region of the oro-nasal cavity in general yielded higher viral genome loads than the

202

cranial, respiratory region. Infectious virus could be cultivated from the nasal conchae of animals

203

#1 (2.86 Log10 TCID50/ml) and #2 (1.63 Log10 TCID50/ml). Of note, none of the lung samples

204

was positive for viral RNA, nor did any of the animals demonstrate viremia. Both animals

205

investigated at 4 dpi had viral RNA in samples of the CNS with low genome loads (max 2.95

206

Log10 genome copies/ml), but cerebrospinal fluid was negative in all tested animals.

207

At autopsy, no gross lesions were recorded that could be assigned to the SARS-CoV-2-

208

infection. However, histopathology identified mild rhinitis at 4, 8, and 12 dpi (animals #1-3, #5,

209

#6). The olfactory, caudal region of the nasal cavity was more consistently affected compared to

210

the respiratory, cranial region and included degeneration, necrosis and loss of the respiratory and

211

olfactory epithelium, presence of intraluminal cellular debris, degeneration and necrosis of the

212

submucosal glands, mucosal edema, endothelial swelling and acute, submucosal hemorrhage

213

(Figure 2, panels E-G). At 4 dpi, mainly neutrophils with fewer macrophages and lymphocytes

214

were found, later lesions showed predominantly lymphocytes and fewer neutrophils and

215

macrophages. Mucosal coagulative necrosis with early re-epithelization and granulation tissue

216

formation was present in one case (Figure 2, panel G, 8 dpi). At 28 dpi, one infected (#7) and one

217

contact animal (#10) showed lesions indicative for previous viral replication sites in the nasal

218

conchae. Viral RNA was still present, but no viral antigen was found (Appendix Figure 2).

219

Immunohistochemistry verified the presence of viral antigen only in the nasal conchae.

220

Lesion associated antigen was found to be oligofocal at day 4 (animal #1, #2) in the respiratory

221

and olfactory epithelium and to a lesser extent at day 8 (animal #3) only in the olfactory epithelium

222

(Figure 2, panels H-J). No viral antigen could be found at 12 dpi and 28 dpi, and neither

223

histopathologic lesions nor viral antigen were detected in animal #4 (8 dpi) in the nasal cavity. All

224

other tissues tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antigen.

225

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in all infected animals at 8 dpi as shown

226

by ELISA (Figure 3, panels A-G) and iIFAT (> 1:64, Table 1). Titers increased up to 1:1024,

227

detected at 28 dpi via iIFAT (animal #7). Neutralizing antibodies (VNA) were observed in two of

228

the inoculated animals (#6, #7) as early as 8 dpi (#6, 1:5.04, Tab. 1). The highest VNA titer was

229

1:12.7 (#6, day 12; #7 day, 28). Interestingly, animal #7 showed fluctuating iIFAT titers, but

230

demonstrated a consistent increase in VNA titers until termination of the experiment (1:12.7, 28

231

dpi). A similar pattern was observed in a surrogate assay mimicking virus neutralization (sVNT).

232

Using the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein we further characterized antibody responses in

233

an in-house ELISA (Figure 3, panels B-G, panel I). Anti-RBD IgM and IgG levels peaked at 8 and

234

12 dpi, respectively. A similar kinetics was observed in the infected contact animals #10 and #11.

235

RBD-specific IgG2 patterns were highly similar to those of total IgG and total RBD antibodies.

236

IgG2 antibodies with high neutralizing capacity had also been reported in dogs and their abundance

237

correlates with neutralizing capacity (26) (Table 1, animals #5 and 6, 8 dpi). Although the amount

238

of IgA in serum was limited (Figure 3, panel F), a similar trend as detected for the overall serum

239

antibody levels was observed (Figure 3, panel G), e.g. with animal #6 having the highest values,

and contact animals #10 and #11 reaching peak levels at later time points. RBD-specific antibodies

241

were also detected in saliva samples 8 and 12 dpi (Figure 3, panel H-I) from animals that developed

242

serum antibodies.

243

To test whether viral adaptions occurred during infection of raccoon dogs with this human

244

SARS-CoV-2 isolate, we performed high throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 re-isolated from

245

nasal swabs of infected raccoon dog #2 at 2 dpi and contact animal #10 at 8 dpi yielding 100%

246

identity to the inoculum (2019_nCoV Muc-IMB-1).

247

Discussion

248

The present experimental study demonstrates that raccoon dogs are susceptible to SARS-

249

CoV-2 infection and transmit the virus to contact animals.

250

successfully infected by intranasal inoculation. The susceptibility of raccoon dogs thus appears

251

similar to Rousettus bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and slightly lower than ferrets (Mustela putorius

252

furo) (23) (23). Virus shedding in nasal and oropharyngeal swabs of raccoon dogs resulted in

253

successful onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to two out of three contact animals as has been

254

observed for other animal species with direct cage neighbors (23, 29–31).

Six out of nine animals were

255

Increasing evidence supports the potential of several carnivore species to become infected

256

by SARS-CoV-2 as a result of anthropo-zoonotic transmission (13), possibly leading to re-

257

infections of humans (13). Therefore, wild carnivore species whether free-living or held in

258

captivity should also be considered as intermediate hosts. With China’s substantial contribution to

259

the global fur production of > 50 million animals per annum (20) (Appendix Figure3, panel A), it

260

is conceivable that raccoon dogs may have played a hitherto unexplored role in the development

261

of the pandemic, particularly considering the very mild signs of infection, efficient replication and

262

transmission, and genetic stability. These environments with close contact between animals and

263

an obvious interface with humans support SARS-CoV-2 transmission as was seen in several large

264

mink farm outbreaks in The Netherlands, Denmark and Spain (13, 19, 32, 33).

265

No obvious clinical signs could be observed, which is in line with experimental studies in

266

other carnivores, i.e. adult cats (Felis catus) and ferrets that showed productive SARS-CoV-2

267

infection with no, or only mild clinical signs (23, 31). By prominent nasal virus shedding in the

268

absence of symptoms, raccoon dogs present a picture of infection resembling asymptomatic

269

infections in other animals reflected by restriction of virus replication to the upper respiratory

270

tract, substantiating the role of the nasal cavity in infection as shown for other animal species (23,

271

31), as well as the majority of human cases (34). Except for a mild rhinitis associated with the

272

presence of viral antigen in the nasal mucosa, no other infection-related histopathological changes

273

were observed. However, the absence of viral genome, pathohistological changes or viral antigen

274

in the lungs of infected animals argue against raccoon dogs as a model for pulmonary manifestation

275

of COVID-19.

276

The serological results suggest that the induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific VNA in raccoon

277

dogs is reduced compared to ferrets but comparable to Egyptian fruit bats (23). A delayed

278

production of VNAs cannot be excluded, but appears unlikely against the dynamic increase of the

279

measured ELISA antibodies. A mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2, i.e. antibodies in

280

saliva were detected in raccoon dogs already 12 dpi (Figure 3), supporting the use of saliva as an

281

early and non-invasive sample for epidemiological studies (35). The limited presence of viral

282

antigen in infected raccoon dogs at 4 dpi and the rapid decrease in viral loads prior to the

283

development of measurable humoral immunity indicates that innate immune responses including

284

interferon, mucus movement and epithelial cell turnover may play a prominent role in reducing

285

infection.

286

High throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 re-isolated from nasal swabs of infected

287

raccoon dogs and contact animals yielded 100% identity to the inoculum (2019_nCoV Muc-IMB-

288

1), demonstrating that no mutations occurred during virus replication in raccoon dogs. This is in

289

contrast to findings in infected ferrets where two nonsynonymous single nucleotide exchanges

290

after the ferret passage were identified (25). This may indicate that the virus is already sufficiently

291

adapted to this putative intermediate host.

292

In conclusion, further evidence is required from research about the origin of this pandemic.

293

Large-scale sero-epidemiological studies in susceptible animals are needed. Historical samples

294

collected prior to the epidemic are of particular importance and should preferentially also include

295

a time series of archived samples. Further, affected fur farms may serve as reservoirs for SARS-

296

CoV-2 and this risk should be mitigated by efficient and continuous surveillance. While SARS-

297

CoV-2 might be controlled in holdings by very strict measures (13, 32), a spill-over into

298

susceptible wildlife species, in particular free living raccoon dogs representing one of the most

299

successful invasive carnivore species in Europe (36) (Appendix Figure 3, panel B), would be even

300

a greater challenge for elimination as long as preventive options are limited.

Figure 1. Study design (A) Outline of the in vivo experiments with an observation period of 28

423

days. Animals (n=9) were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50/ml and three naïve direct

424

contacts were added 1 dpi. On day 4 (animals #1, #2), day 8 (#3, #4), and 12 (#5, #6) two

425

raccoon dogs each were sacrificed and subjected to autopsy. All remaining animals were

426

euthanized on day 28 pi. Animals that became infected are highlighted in red. (B) Arrangement

427

of the individual cages for the raccoon dogs in two separate rooms of the BSL 3 facility at the

428

Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut. Inoculated animals (brown), contact animals (blue) and animals that

429

remained uninfected ( ) are indicated.
