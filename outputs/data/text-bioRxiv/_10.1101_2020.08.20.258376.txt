Abstract
A novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been pandemic
worldwide. The genetic dynamics of quasispecies afford RNA viruses a great fitness on cell
tropism and host range. However, no quasispecies data of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported
yet. To explore quasispecies haplotypes and its transmission characteristics, we carried out
single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 spike gene
within 14 RNA samples from 2 infection clusters, covering first- to third-generation
infected-patients. We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (modeled as
‘One-King’): one dominant haplotype (mean abundance ~70.15%) followed by numerous
minor haplotypes (mean abundance < 0.10%). We not only discovered a novel dominant
haplotype of F1040 but also realized that minor quasispecies were also worthy of attention.
Notably, some minor haplotypes (like F1040 and currently pandemic one G614) could
potentially reveal adaptive and converse into the dominant one. However, minor haplotypes
exhibited a high transmission bottleneck (~6% could be stably transmitted), and the new
adaptive/dominant haplotypes were likely originated from genetic variations within a host
rather than transmission. The evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.68-3.86 × 10-3 per site per
year, which was larger than the estimation at consensus genome level. The ‘One-King’ model
and conversion event expanded our understanding of the genetic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2,
and explained the incomprehensible phenomenon at the consensus genome level, such as
limited cumulative mutations and low evolutionary rate. Moreover, our findings suggested the
epidemic strains may be multi-host origin and future traceability would face huge difficulties.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are enveloped, single, and positive-stranded RNA viruses that can be further
classified into four genera: alphacoronaviruses, betacoronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses,
and deltacoronaviruses1. The betacoronaviruses have a zoonotic potential and can be
transmitted from animals to humans causing a novel, severe respiratory disease2. The severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was
broken out in 2002, and globally resulted in nearly 8000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 800
deaths3,4. The natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was presumed to be Rhinolophus Sinensis
(Coronavirus strains: RsSHC014 and Rs3367)5. In 2012, another betacoronaviruse
(MERS-CoV) caused the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)

6,7

. By

November 2019, the MERS have resulted in 2494 cases and 858 deaths worldwide8. The
origin of MERS-CoV remains elusive, but studies have shown that humans were infected by
direct or indirect contact with the infected dromedary camels in Arabian Peninsula (WHO).
Although the two large-scale epidemics have gradually subsided, the threat from zoonotic
betacoronaviruses always exists due to its inherent characteristics (genetic diversity) and
frequently contact between humans and animals (hunting and domestication).
In December 2019, Wuhan, China, has emerged unknown pneumonia cases with the
main symptoms of fever, fatigue, cough, and poor breath (COVID-19). The epidemic has
been confirmed to be caused by a novel betacoronaviruses called SARS-CoV-2 9. Genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed a high similarity (~0.96) with bat coronavirus RaTG13,
indicating a potential bat origin of the virus10,11. The COVID-19 is still pandemic, and there
were over 15 million confirmed cases and 600,000 deaths worldwide by August, 2020.
Although antiviral drugs and vaccines are under development12,13, the actual work will face
many challenges like long-periodic clinical trials and the risk of poor effects caused by high
mutation rate. To guide and obtain effective antiviral strategies, it is therefore crucial to study
and understand the underlying genetic mechanisms of fitness during infection.
In the consensus genome level, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported with limited
variations14-17. RNA virus population in a host does not consist of a consensus single
haplotype, but rather an ensemble of related sequences termed quasispecies. The dynamic
changes of quasispecies affords RNA viruses a greater probability to change their cell tropism

or host range or to overcome internal or external selective constraints18. The process is likely
achieved by changing the genetic characteristics of key functional genes, such as the spike
glycoprotein gene19. A novel amino mutation D614G within spike protein has currently found
to be widely spread in newly infected patients, and its infectious ability reveals 2.6-9.3 times
stronger than the early ancestor D614 haplotype20-22. Spike gene could be primarily determined
its

observe the dynamic fitness of SARS-CoV-2, but also widely discover the potential
advantage mutations (like G614) in advance, which were crucial for virus prevention, such as
drug design and vaccine development. However, no data have reported its quasispecies yet.
Therefore, the aim of the study is to investigate the quasispecies features of
SARS-CoV-2. We applied PicBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) technology and circular
consensus sequences (CCS) algorithm to obtain quasispecies haplotypes. The included 9
cases and its related 14 samples were carefully prepared to achieve two major research
objectives. Firstly, to fully trace the quasispecies features and its dynamics during
transmission (between hosts), our cases were screened from two single-source infection sets
(containing two familial clusters), and covered first- to third-generation patients. Secondly, to
facilitate the discovery of quasispecies differences between sampling types (within host),
RNAs were designed to extract from nasopharyngeal swabs (NS), sputum (SP), and stool
(ST). Moreover, we have also predicted the potential advantage genotypes and the
evolutionary rate at the quasispecies level. Our results provided insight into the genetic fitness
of SARS-CoV-2 and also provided important information for the follow-up prevention.

Results
Single-molecule real-time sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene
For all 14 samples (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table1), the SMRT platform produced 26.97
Gb subreads (Mean: 1.93±0.88 Gb) and the corresponding 379,079 CCS (5,044 ~ 52,739)
(Supplementary Table 2). Metagenomic sequencing revealed that more than 98% of
quasispecies RNA contains the identical designed primer sequences, indicating the amplified
segments (subreads and CCS) have no obvious primer bias (Supplementary Fig. 1). Through

increasing the pass number, the main type of sequencing errors within subreads (gaps:
insertions and deletions) could be self-corrected during the generation of CCS. Statistics
showed that the average gap number of CCS decreases to a low stable value (median: 23,
account for 0.60% of full length) when the pass number equaled 5 (Fig. 2a). Therefore, only
CCS with pass ≥5 were considered for further analysis, which accounted for 74.83% (283,655)
of the total number and the related subreads accounted for 90.54% of the total sequencing
data (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 2).

Evaluation of genetic diversity and evolutionary rate of quasispecies haplotypes
A total number of 282,866 qualified CCS (99.72%) contained a full length of spike gene, and
could be merged into 25,490 quasispecies haplotypes (1,581-3,713; Table 1). Compared to an
early ancestral strain (Wuhan-Hu-1, Jan 05, 2020; GenBank: MN908947.3), all haplotypes
accumulated 8,978 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 6,458 amino acid changes. The
average genetic distance of quasispecies was ~8.36 × 10-4, while the value of ST samples
(9.14 × 10-4) was greater than that of NS (8.11 × 10-4) and SP samples (8.13 × 10-4) (Fig.
3a). We further observed that the percentage of missense mutations and nonsense mutations
in ST samples was also higher than the other two sampling types, where the percentage of
missense mutations of ST, NS, and SP was 78.76%, 75.90%, and 75.24%, the percentage of
nonsense mutations was 4.59%, 3.53%, and 4.16%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Based on these mutations, the overall substitution rate of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes was
estimated to be 2.68-3.86 × 10-3 per site per year (Fig. 3b).

Identification of a novel quasispecies structure with the form of ‘unique dominant +
numerous minors’
The quasispecies structure of all samples revealed the same style that unique dominant
haplotypes with extremely high abundance of 56.02-76.97% (mean: 70.15%) combined with
a huge number of minor haplotypes with extremely low abundance of < 5% (mean: < 0.1%)
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The special quasispecies structure made a low quasispecies
complexity that the overall Sn value was 1.35 × 10-3. For details, SP revealed significantly
lower than other two sampling types (Chi-square test: p-value = 0.06), where the mean Sn

value is 0.64 × 10-3, 1.59 × 10-3, and 1.82 × 10-3 for SP, NS, and ST, respectively (Fig. 3c).
Two single-source groups contained different dominant haplotypes, where FG harbored an
SNV 3118G>T and SG showed the same with the reference strain with 3118G (Table 1). The
principal component analysis showed that the dimension of 3118G>T could be fully classified
the samples into two groups and explained more than 98.5% of variances (Fig. 3d and
Supplementary Fig. 4).

Observing the dynamics of quasispecies: high transmission bottleneck of minor
haplotypes, and potentially multi-host origin of new dominant haplotypes
For the top 30 most abundant quasispecies of each sample, the dominant haplotypes 3118G
and 3118T, together with other 20 minor ones could be shared by at least six samples. The
shared haplotypes (SH) could be stably transmitted and survived between hosts or at different
infection stage within hosts (Fig. 4a). A huge transmission bottleneck was observed for the
minor haplotypes, where only ~ 5.66% (20/353) could be treated as SH. Dominant haplotype
3118G was the same with the reference early Wuhan strain (ancestor), and maintained the
most stable existence (shared by all 14 samples). However, the abundance of 3118G
decreased rapidly in FG familial cluster and became the minor haplotypes with a low
abundance of 0.11 to 0.80% during spread. Instead, haplotype 3118T had replaced the
ancestral 3118G as the major one in the first-generation case FG1 and further delivered to
other cases of FG, while it was just a dust like minor haplotype in two SG samples
(SG4-0211-ST: 0.009% and SG2-0131-SP: 0.003%). Compared with the published genome
sequences (by August, 2020), the 3118G>T was a novel SNV resulting in Valine to
Phenylalanine amino acid changes (V1040F) in S2 domain (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig.
5). By simulating the three-dimensional model of spike protein, we observed the mutation of
V1040F may further change its corresponding R-group (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7).
Except for SH, most haplotypes (99.38%) were rare haplotypes (RH) that shared by less
than five samples and with extremely low abundance, where 80.16% were singletons. These
RH seemed to have no competitive advantage and survive as minor quasispecies in the early
samples (mean abundance < 0.1%). However, we cannot ignore the existence of the SH,
because it may become a dominant haplotype under certain conditions and cause a pandemic.

The RH with mutation of 1841A>G (D614G) was currently prevalent in newly infected
patients worldwide (Fig. 5). The mutation of 1841A>G revealed a high-frequency and was
shared by 19 haplotypes, and most of them (18/19) were emerged by self-mutating of
dominant haplotype 3118T (Fig. 5). The epidemic haplotype 1841G (G614) has already existed
in early cases of our study, indicating the fitness haplotype may be multi-host origin. Due to
high transmission bottleneck, cases obtained new advantage mutations were likely by
self-mutating rather than transmission.
Based on our findings, we proposed a ‘One-King’ model to reflect the special
quasispecies structure of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6a), and also inferred the high possibility of
multi-host origin of the advantage mutations or haplotypes (Figure 6b). Finally, we extracted
mainly two kinds of potentially fitness mutations within the SH and RH. One was
high-abundant mutations on the top 30 abundant haplotuypes and the other was high
frequency mutations shared by at least 15 haplotypes, which was separately found 225 and
337 missense mutations in different functional domains (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

Discussion
Two infection chains with nine first- to third-generation cases made it possible to study the
quasispecies and its dynamics during transmission (Fig. 1). SARS-Cov-2 revealed a special
quasispecies composition that one dominant haplotype combined with numerous minor
haplotypes. We not only discovered a novel advantage haplotype, but also realized that minor
quasispecies were also worthy of attention, especially the minor haplotypes with
high-abundant or high-frequent genetic variations. These minor ones may potentially exhibit a
strong fitness and grow into the dominant one. However, due to the high transmission
bottleneck, source hosts or cases obtained such advantage haplotypes or mutations were likely
self-obtained from virus mutations rather than obtained by transmission. Our findings
suggested its potential multi-host origin of an epidemic strain. Moreover, we modeled the
special quasispecies structure as ‘One-King’, and it could explain incomprehensible
phenomenon at the strain genome level, such as limited cumulative mutations

genetic mechanism on the fitness changes of SARS-Cov-2.

High-quality haplotype sequences lay the foundation for the subsequent analysis and its
interpretation. More than 98% virus genomes contained the identical sequences to the
amplified primers, indicating the CCS results have no primer bias (Supplementary Fig. 1).
We obtained an average 27,000 quasispecies sequences for each sample, and the number was
more than the SARS-Cov quasispecies study using traditional sanger methods (28 spike
sequences from 19 patients)

28

and results from the recent HCV quasispecies study using the

same SMRT platform (average 8,130 CCS for each samples with pass > 5)

29

. More than

80,000 cumulative SNVs facilitated us to calculate the evolutionary rate at quasispecies level.
The average substitution rate of SARS-Cov-2 was estimated as 2.68-3.86×10-3 per site per
year (Fig. 3b), which was larger than its recent estimation value of 0.99-1.83×10-3 at the
consensus genome level

25-27

. Compared with other betacoronaviruses, the evolutionary rate

of SARS-Cov-2 was similar to that of SARS-Cov (1.16 - 3.30 ×10-3 and 1.67 - 4.67×10-3 for
non-synonymous and synonymous mutations, respectively)30, but slightly larger than
MERS-Cov (1.23-2.04×10-3 ) 31.
We observed a special quasispecies structure of SARS-Cov-2 that unique dominant
haplotypes with abundance of 56.02-76.97% combined with numerous minor haplotypes with
mean abundance of < 0.1%, which seemed like ‘master + dust’ (Supplementary Fig. 3). The
proportion of main quasispecies was much higher than that of SARS-Cov
virus like HBV and HCV

and other RNA

. Two single-source infection groups had different dominant

haplotypes, which was consistent with two independent infection chains. The dominant
haplotype of SG (V1040) was the same with the strain from early stage of the epidemic.
However, a novel haplotype with F1040 replaced the V1040 became the dominant one in FG,
while the V1040 haplotype still existed as minor form (Figs. 4a and b). All indicated that the
dominant haplotype and minor haplotype could be switched under some situations. The same
phenomenon was also found in rare haplotypes (RH). The currently epidemic strain 1841G
(G614)

21 22

has already existed in our early samples as the minor type (Fig. 5). Although the

novel dominant genotype F1040 may have changed the structure of spike protein to obtain a
fitness advantage (Supplementary Figs. 5-7), it has not spread as widely as G614, which may
be due to timely clinical testing and isolation treatment.

According to these findings, we termed and used the ‘One-King’ model to represent this
special quasispecies structure. All quasispecies haplotypes in a host were just like all people
in an ancient kingdom. There can only be one king in a kingdom, with extremely great power
(Unique dominant haplotype with extremely high abundance). In the kingdom, any capable
soldier or normal person had a chance to become the king under some situations (Minor
haplotypes with advantage mutations could potentially become the dominant one) (Fig. 6a).
The ‘One-King’ model could explain some incomprehensible phenomena at strain genome
level. The reason why SARS seemed to have only limited cumulative mutations and a small
evolutionary rate was because limited dominant haplotypes determined the consensus genome
sequences, while ignoring a large amount of minor haplotypes and its mutations.
Our results observed the possibility that some advantage minor haplotypes becoming the
dominant one. However, such minor haplotypes were likely self-obtained from virus rather
than from transmission, because the ‘One-King’ structure was more conducive to the spread
of major haplotypes, but likely caused a transmission bottleneck for minor ones. That was
why only a small proportion of minor haplotypes (< 6%) could be shared by cases in the same
infection chain (Fig. 4), and also all hosts with dominant haplotype 3118T (F1040) obtained the
advantage mutation A1841G (G614) by self-mutated (Fig. 5). The high likelihood of
self-obtained (~0.94) suggested that the dominant haplotype may be of multi-host origin (Fig.
6b), which was the possible reason why the dominant mutation of D614G appears in different
cases with geographical isolation worldwide (Fig. 5). Although this kind of fitness mutations
emerged in minor haplotypes, their frequency was relative high, indicating a selective
advantage.
Due to the special structure and short evolution time, the genetic distance and complexity
of SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies revealed greatly low. Nevertheless, quasispecies features could
still be showed different between sampling types. Samples from stools had a larger genetic
distance and more nonsense mutations and missense mutations than nasopharyngeal swab,
and sputum (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating stool samples contained
relatively more inactive virus. In other aspects, the standard entropy (Sn) of sputum samples
was the lowest (Fig. 3c), indicating its haplotype composition was more dispersed than other
two types, and its minor haplotypes may have a larger transmission bottleneck.

Our study had some limitations. Firstly, due to technical limitations, it was currently
difficult to obtain a haplotype with full-length of genome (~29Kb), and the spike gene (~4Kb)
may be partially reflected the genome-wide quasispecies information. Secondly, insufficient
number of samples made it difficult to observe the dynamics in a relatively large scope such
as the intermediate transition state. Thirdly, the current study only focuses on SNVs, and
other mutation types such as insertions, deletions, and structural variations need to be further
studied.
The ‘One-King’ structure of SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies reflected a novel quasispecies
genetic fitness mechanism. Behind the dominant haplotype, there were countless minor
fitness haplotypes that could be survived as dominant one in different hosts. Although these
haplotypes may be suppressed and unable overcome the transmission bottleneck, the
advantage mutations within them could be high-frequently obtained by virus mutations.
Future molecular epidemiologic investigations, clinical interventions and vaccine designs
need to consider the potential advantage SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies and its related mutations,
which are missed by routine single concensus genotype 34 (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).

Methods
Participants in the study
Nine patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. All of them
were admitted to Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (CPHMC), the designated hospital
for COVID-19 treatment in Chongqing centre area. According to the epidemic history, all
patients were divided into two single-source infection cluster groups, SG cluster and FG
cluster group (Fig. 1a). The first group contained a familial cluster containing five
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, including one first-generation case infected in Wuhan (patient:
FG1), and four second-generation cases (FG2, FG3, FG4, and FG5) infected by FG1 in
Chongqing, China (Fig. 1b). The first case FG1 (a 70-year-old male) was a local resident in
Wuhan, and came to Chongqing to visit his younger sister’s family (FG2, FG2’s husband:
FG3, FG2’s son: FG4, FG2’s grandson: FG5) in Jan 15 of 2020 by taking a train and then
they lived together from that day. It was on that day he presented a symptom of fever (highest
temperature 37.7 °C), cough, and took antipyretic himself. He went to clinic on Jan 21 since

no relief of symptoms and was test positive of SARS-CoV-2 in Jan 24 and then he was
transferred to the designated hospital CPHMC. His younger sister FG2 (60-year-old), the
husband FG3 (62-year-old, P3) , the son FG4 (36-year-old) and the grandson FG2
(10-year-old) start to present fever and or cough symptom with highest temperature 39.3 °C,
38 °C 37.5 °C, 38 °C since Jan 24, Jan19, Jan24, and Jan25, respectively. All FG2, FG3,
FGP4 and FG5 were quarantined as close contacts since FG1 was conformed as
second-generation case, and received test in Jan 25 and Jan 26, the results came positive and
then they were transferred to CPHMC also in Jan 27 and Jan 31. CT scan showed classical
diffuse ground-glass opacity in both sides of lung for all five patients, and both they received
Lopinavir/Ritonavir plus interferon-α antiviral treatment. Additionally, FG1, FG2, FG3 was
given oxygen support though nasal cannula. FG1 had developed severe illness with the
condition of 15-year hypertension. All of them recovered and discharged from hospital after a
period therapy.
The second group contains four second- or third-generation cases infected by the same
first-generation case, where one patient (SG1: 2nd) from an unknown family and three patients
from the same family (SG2: 2nd; SG3: 3rd; SG4: 3rd) (Fig. 1b). The first generation case
returned to Chongqing from Wuhan on January 20 and next had a dinner with two friends
(SG1 and SG2) on January 21. SG1 and SG2 presented a symptom of fever, cough, and took
antipyretic by self, and received positive test result in Jan 23, Jan 24 and Jan 25. Through
direct contact, two family members of SG2 were also infected and revealed viral RNA
positive on 19 Jan, including SG2’s wife SG4 and SG4’s mother SG3. According to the order
of contact, SG1 and SG2 were considered as second cases, while SG3 and SG4 were third
cases. Fourteen samples, include nasopharyngeal swab (NS), sputum (SP), and stool (ST),
were collected from these 9 patients. The time points of samples were descripted in Fig 1b.
All of them recovered and discharged from hospital after a period therapy. All the samples
were from our previous study

Viral RNA was extracted by using the EZ1 virus mini kit of QIAGEN Company in Germany,
and then 8μL of each was reverse transcribed into cDNA by using the commercial company's
reverse transcription kit (TAKARA No. 6110A). The full-length spike gene (3882 nt) was
further amplified by a pair of RT-PCR primers designed by online methods from NCBI. The
forward primer was: 5 '- barcod- AGGGGTACTGCTGTTATGTCT-3'), and the reverse
primer was: 5'-barcod- GCGCGAACAAAATCTGAAGG-3'. We used 50 μl PCR system to
conduct the PCR reaction, and the system includes 5 μL SARS-CoV-2 cDNA, 2.5μl forward
and reverse primer (10μmol/L), 25μl Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB No. M0492S),
complement volume with Nuclease-Free Water (Thermofisher). PCR reaction conditions:
denaturation 98°C/30s, circulation (35 times) 98°C/10s, 54°C/30s, 72°C/ 3min; extension
72°C/6min. The PCR product was electrophoretic in 0.8% agarose gel to verify whether the
product was successfully amplified. Next, using Ampure PB beads of Pacific Biosciences
company in the USA for pcr products size selection: First, the Ampure PB beads were diluted
to a 35% concentration using elution buffer; Then, the diluted Ampure PB beads were used
for enrichment fragments larger than 3Kb (Target fragment was ~4 Kb), the volume of the
diluted Ampure PB beads is about 3 times of the sample volume. After size selection,
full-length DNA of S gene was quantified using The Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer and Qubit dsDNA
HS Assay Kit (Thermofisher No. Q32851).
Due to sample quality or load of viral RNA, not all three sampling types could be
successfully amplified the target segment. Seven samples could be obtained the
next-generation sequencing reads from metagenomic sequencing, which was used to access
the amplification bias by BWA software

(Supplementary Fig. 1). Finally, a total number

of 14 samples passed the quality control and screened for further analysis (Supplementary
table 1). The sample name reflected three aspects of information including patients, sampling
date, sources of nucleic acid. For example, FG1-0126-NS meant viral RNA was extracted
form nasopharyngeal swabs of FG1 patients on January 26, 2020.

Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the target segments
About 100ng full-length DNA of spike gene was used for library construction. For briefly, the
full-length cDNA was subjected to damage repair, end repair/A-tailing, and ligation of the

SMRT adapter and unique label for each sample. The primers and DNA-binding polymerase
were combined to generate a complete SMRT bell library. After qualitatively analyzing the
library, the PacBio Sequel I platform was used for sequencing according to the effective
concentration of the library and the data output requirements. We applied SMRT Link
software to obtain the circular consensus sequences (CCS), and only CCS with over 5
full-passes were considered for further analysis (Fig. 2).

Data processing
After performing the quality control and removing the low-quality subreads (minimum
predicted accuracy of 90%), we totally obtained 26.97 Gb of subreads for all 14 samples
(Supplementary table 1). Our results showed that the number of CCS gaps decreased rapidly
and tended to be stable when pass equaled 5 (Fig. 2a). Further statistics showed that such
reads account for ~90% of total sequencing data (Fig. 2b and Supplementary table 2). The
spike gene (S gene) of strain Wuhan-Hu-1 (Extracted from patients with early infection in
Wuhan; GenBank accession number MN908947.3, it was submitted in January 5, 2020)37 was
used as reference to detect single nucleotide variations (SNVs). We applied BLAST38
software to perform alignment between CCS and the reference, and then obtained all the CCS
results containing full length of spike gene. A total number of 282,866 CCS were finally
identified (Table 1). The complexity and diversity of quasispecies were detected by
calculating standardized Shannon entropy (Sn) and mean genetic distance (d), respectively
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The former formula is Sn = - Σi (pi*Inpi) / InN, where pi
was the frequency of the top abundance quasispecies, and N was the total number of
quasispecies haplotypes. Meanwhile, SNV information were extracted using PERL scripts
based on the BLAST results. CCS with the same haplotype was further clustered into the
same quasispecies haplotype, and its abundance was further calculated by PERL scripts
(Supplementary Fig. 3). The R program was applied to perform Principle component
analysis (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 2). The three-dimensional ribbon models for the
spike protient was prepared by UCSF Chimera39 based on the entry 6VSB in Protein Data
Bank

Figure 5 Haplotypes with the current pandemic mutations of 1841A>G (D614G).
Haplotypes with red background were current pandemic strains collected from six countries,
all which contained the fitness mutation of 1841A>G (D614G). The 1841G (G614) genotype
had already existed in some SH of this study. Please refer to the legends of Fig. 4 for the
meaning of each element in this Figure. FG cases (with 3118T dominant haplotype) had
obtained the 1841G (G614) likely through viral mutations rather than infection (all with
1841G-3118T).

Figure 6 Models of the quasispecies structure and origin of dominant haplotypes. (a) The
‘One-King’ model of SARS-CoV-2 Quasispecies structure. All quasispecies haplotypes in a
host were just like all people in an ancient kingdom. There can only be one king in a kingdom,
with extremely great power (Unique dominant haplotype with extremely high abundance). In
the kingdom, any capable soldier or normal person had a chance to become the king under
some situations (Minor haplotypes with advantage mutations could potentially become the
dominant one). (b) Two ways that cases obtaining new dominant haplotype. Due to the
special quasispecies structure, the minor haplotypes had a high transmission bottleneck, and
only ~6% could show stable transmission. For the cases with a new epidemic virus strain, the
roughly likelihood of obtaining it through infection was estimated as 0.06, while the
likelihood of self-obtained by mutating within host was 0.94. Our results indicated that new
