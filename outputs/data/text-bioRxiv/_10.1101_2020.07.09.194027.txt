ABSTRACT
The molecular properties of CD8 + T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully
known. Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes of >80,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells from
39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy subjects. COVID-19 patients segregated into two groups based
on whether the dominant CD8 + T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 was ‘exhausted’ or not. SARS-CoV-2reactive cells in the exhausted subset were increased in frequency and displayed lesser cytotoxicity
and inflammatory features in COVID-19 patients with mild compared to severe illness. In contrast,
SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in the non-exhausted subsets from patients with severe disease showed
enrichment of transcripts linked to co-stimulation, pro-survival NF- B signaling, and anti-apoptotic
pathways, suggesting the generation of robust CD8 + T cell memory responses in patients with severe
COVID-19 illness. CD8+ T cells reactive to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus from healthy subjects
displayed polyfunctional features. Cells with such features were mostly absent in SARS-CoV-2
responsive cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
Overall, our single-cell analysis revealed substantial diversity in the nature of CD8 + T cells responding
to SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus infections with SARS-CoV-2 have created a global crisis; a large international effort
is underway to develop treatments and vaccines to reduce the severity of disease and to provide
protective immunity. To inform this effort, a detailed understanding of anti-viral immune responses is
required. CD8+ T cell responses are thought to be critical for control of viral infections1-4, but to date, our
understanding of anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses, specifically against Coronaviridae during infection
and in the memory phase, is limited. Recently, studies have begun to improve our knowledge about
CD8+ T cells responsive to SARS-CoV-25-14, but the molecular features that associate with poor clinical
outcomes or differentiate them from other virus-reactive CD8+ T cells remain incompletely understood.
We report here on the data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing of virus-reactive CD8+ T cells
from COVID-19 patients with varying severity of disease. We benchmark these data against the
transcriptomes from CD8+ T cells from healthy donors, who have memory responses to other respiratory
viruses.

RESULTS
Evaluation of virus-reactive CD8+ T cells
From 39 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (17 patients with relatively milder
disease not requiring hospitalization, 13 hospitalized patients and 9 additional patients requiring
intensive care unit (ICU) support (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Table 1)), we isolated virus-reactive
CD8+ memory T cells using a modified Antigen-Reactive T cell Enrichment (ARTE) assay 15-17.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were first stimulated for 24 hours with peptide pools specific
to SARS-CoV-27,8 (online Methods). Responding cells were then isolated based on the expression of
the cell surface activation markers CD137 and CD69 (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data Fig. 1a)5,8,9. We
observed that the numbers of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ memory T cells were significantly increased
in patients with severe COVID-19 illness who required hospitalization compared to those with milder
illness not requiring hospitalization (Fig. 1b). A large fraction of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells co-

expressed CD279 (PD-1), CD38, and HLA-DR, which are markers linked to T cell activation and
exhaustion6,18,19 (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1b and Extended Data Table 2). Recent studies in
patients with COVID-19 illness have reported that circulating CD8+ T cells express activation markers
CD137 and CD69, likely activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo5,9; these cells are also captured and
contribute to an unbiased evaluation of virus-reactive T cells from patients with recent COVID-19 illness.
To study the properties of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells in healthy non-exposed
individuals5,20,21, we isolated CD8+ T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools from healthy
subjects, who provided blood samples pre-COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Table 1).
To contextualize our data and to define shared or distinguishing properties of CD8 + T cells reactive with
other common non-corona respiratory viruses, we stimulated PBMC from healthy subjects with peptide
pools specific to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A (FLU) and isolated responding cells
(Fig. 1a). In total, from 49 subjects, we sorted and analyzed the single transcriptome and T cell receptor
(TCR) sequence of > 87,000 virus-reactive CD8+ T cells with good quality metrics (Fig. 1a, Extended
Data Fig. 1c,d and Extended Data Table 3).

Virus-reactive CD8+ T cells show transcriptomic heterogeneity
Our unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis of all the virus-reactive CD8+ T cells revealed 8
distinct clusters (Fig. 2a-c and Extended Data Table 4), indicating that CD8+ memory T cells can
activate a wide range of transcriptional programs in response to different viral infections 22. Recent
reports from COVID-19 patients have suggested the presence of exhaustion-related markers in global
CD8+ T cell populations. To examine, whether such ‘exhausted’ cells were present in our dataset, we
first generated a consensus list of ‘exhaustion’ signature genes from 9 studies23-31 that reported
exhaustion features in T cells analyzed from patients with infection or cancer and in mouse models of
viral infection (Extended Data Table 5). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of individual clusters
showed significant positive enrichment of exhaustion signature genes only in cluster 1 cells (Fig. 2d-f
and Extended Data Fig. 2a). This cluster (cluster 1) was also highly enriched for genes linked to type

I interferon signaling (Fig. 2d-f and Extended Data Fig. 2a), highlighting the association between the
interferon signaling and exhaustion program that has been previously described in the context of murine
LCMV infection32-34. Because CD4+ T cell-mediated help is required for the generation of robust memory
CD8+ T cells35, we assessed if cells in the ‘exhausted’ cluster 1 displayed ‘unhelped’ features that are
linked to the lack of CD4+ T cell ‘help’35. As expected, the exhausted’ cluster 1 was also significantly
enriched for transcripts linked to ‘unhelped’ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2d,e). Despite displaying ‘exhausted’ and
‘unhelped’ features, intriguingly, cells in cluster 1 showed significant positive enrichment of cytotoxicity
signature genes and higher expression levels of cytotoxicity-associated transcripts such as GZMB and
GZMA relative to other clusters (Fig. 2d-f and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b), which suggested potential
heterogeneity within this exhausted subset.
CD8+ T cells reactive to specific viruses made strikingly different contributions to individual
clusters (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Table 3). Clusters 0,1,2, and 3 were overrepresented by SARSCoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells from COVID-19 patients, and are likely to reflect memory or effector cells
generated in the context of a recent infection. In contrast, the vast majority (>80%) of FLU-reactive and
RSV-reactive CD8+ T cells were present in cluster 4, where SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells were
underrepresented (<2%) (Fig. 2g). Cells in cluster 4 expressed higher levels of transcripts encoding for
cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF , CCL3, CCL4, XCL1, and XCL2 (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 2c, and
Extended Data Table 4), resembled polyfunctional CD8+ T cells that have been linked to protective
immunity against a range of viral infections36-38

39.

Besides, this cluster displayed positive enrichment

and the highest score for genes in the aerobic glycolysis pathway, which is linked to better effector
function through multiple mechanisms that are independent of metabolism itself40,41 (Fig. 2d,e and
Extended Data Fig. 2a).
SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells from healthy non-exposed subjects, presumed to be human
coronavirus (CoV)-reactive cells that cross-react with SARS-CoV-221, were mainly present in clusters
0,1, 5 and 6 (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Table 3). The cells in cluster 6 were highly enriched for the
expression of transcripts encoding ZNF683 (Extended Data Fig. 2d), also known as HOBIT, a

transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in the development of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells42.
Notably, the vast majority of cells in cluster 6 were from SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells of healthy nonexposed subjects (Fig. 2g); in contrast, cells from COVID-19 patients were mostly absent in this cluster.
Overall, our data revealed substantial heterogeneity in the nature of CD8 + T cell subsets generated in
response to different viral infections.

Exhausted SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells are increased in mild COVID-19 illness
By linking single-cell transcriptome with T cell receptor (TCR) sequence data of the same cells,
we observed extensive clonal expansion as well as clonal sharing of TCRs between the different SARSCoV-2-reactive subsets in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Table 6,7). Single-cell
trajectory analysis showed that cells in cluster 0,1 and 2 were interconnected rather than following a
unidirectional path (Fig. 3c). Together, our data support both diversity as well as plasticity in the nature
of memory CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the dominant memory subsets
varied substantially across COVID-19 patients with cells in some subsets represented only by a few
patients (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Table 3). For example, over 85% of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+
T cells in patient 8 were just from cluster 3 (identified by * in Fig. 3d), indicating a lack of plasticity in
CD8+ T cell responses in this person.
We next examined how SARS-CoV-2-reactive cell subsets varied between patients. COVID-19
patients broadly clustered into two groups based on whether the majority (>50%) of their CD8 + memory
T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 were either from cluster 1 or cluster 0 (Fig. 3d). Cluster 1 represented
‘exhausted’ cells with significant positive enrichment of both exhaustion and interferon signatures,
whereas cluster 0 cells showed significant negative enrichment of these signatures, i.e., these cells
were not ‘exhausted’ (Fig. 2d,e). Our analysis suggested that a sub-group of COVID-19 patients (30%)
mounted a predominantly ‘exhausted’ CD8+ memory T cell response to SARS-CoV-2. The magnitude
of this ‘exhausted’ response did not show a strong correlation to the time interval between onset of
illness and sample collection (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Importantly, patients with milder disease had a

significantly higher frequency of cells in the ‘exhausted’ cluster (cluster 1) when compared to those with
severe disease (mean 41% versus 20%, Fig. 3e). Further, patients with severe disease when compared
to those with mild disease showed significant enrichment of cytotoxicity signature genes and depletion
of interferon signature genes in cluster 1 (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c), suggesting both quantitative and
qualitative differences in cells in the ‘exhausted’ cluster based on disease severity. In support of
qualitative differences, single-cell differential gene expression analysis showed that cells in the
‘exhaustion’ cluster (cluster 1) from severe COVID-19 patients expressed significantly higher levels of
transcripts encoding for cytotoxicity-associated molecules (granzyme B, granzyme H, granulysin, Fas
ligand5,43) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (CCL3, CCL4, CSF-2, TNF, LTA and LTB)5,9,44 (Fig. 3f,g,
and Extended Data Fig. 3d). Transcripts encoding for several transcription factors that support cytokine
production, inflammation and persistence (T-BET, BHLHE40, NFKB2, REL, FOS, JUNB)45-50 (Fig. 3h,i
and Extended Data Table 8) were also expressed at significantly higher levels in cluster 1 cells from
COVID-19 patients with severe illness. TCR sequence analysis of cells in the ‘exhausted’ cluster 1
revealed greater clonal expansion in patients with severe compared to mild illness, suggesting greater
proliferative capacity and/or persistence of cells from severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3i). Given the
importance of exhaustion programs in preventing excessive host tissue damage in viral infections 51,52,
we speculate that the failure to imprint an ‘exhaustion’ program that restrains T cell effector function
may reflect a failure to limit exaggerated CD8 + T cell effector function, and thereby contribute to disease
pathogenesis in some patients with severe COVID-19 illness.

Pro-survival features in SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells from patients with severe COVID-19
SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from COVID-19 patients, who did not mount a pre-dominant
‘exhausted’ response, were present mainly in clusters 0 and 2, the ‘non-exhausted’ subsets (Fig. 2d,
3d). These ‘non-exhausted’ subsets displayed cytotoxicity signature scores comparable to other
clusters (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, cluster 2 was enriched for cell cycle signature, indicative of a higher
proportion of proliferating cells in this cluster (Fig. 2c, e). We found no significant difference in the

proportions of cells in cluster 0 and 2 between patients with severe and mild COVID-19 illness
(Extended Data Fig. 4a).
However, single-cell differential gene expression analysis in clusters 0, as well as cluster 2,
revealed significant transcriptional differences between COVID-19 patients with mild and severe illness
(Fig. 4a and Extended Data Table 8). Ingenuity pathway analysis of transcripts with increased
expression in cluster 0 from COVID-19 patients with severe relative to mild illness showed significant
enrichment of transcripts in multiple co-stimulation pathways (OX40, CD27, CD28, 4-1BB, CD40), the
NF- B and apoptosis signaling pathways (Fig. 4b-d, Extended Data Fig. 4b-d and Extended Data
Table 9). Co-stimulation is required for the robust activation and generation of memory T cell
responses53, and activation of the NF B pathway is important for T cell IL-2 production, proliferation,
survival, cytokine production, and effector function46. IL2 receptor alpha and STAT5 encoding
transcripts were also increased in severe compared to mild disease, indicating a greater potential for
these cells to receive the pro-survival IL-2 signals54 (Fig. 4a,c). Other transcripts with increased
expression encoded for transcription factors involved in cell fitness and cytokine production
(BHLHE40)45, effector differentiation (BLIMP1)55 and prevention of exhaustion (JUN)49, and for CRTAM
that has previously been shown to be important for generating effective cytotoxic T cells and viral
clearance in mouse models56,57 (Fig. 4a,c,d). In addition, many transcripts encoding for molecules
involved in cell survival and preventing apoptosis like BIRC3, VIM, and BCL2L158 were also increased
in cells from patients with severe COVID-19 illness, although some molecules with pro-apoptotic
function (e.g., BAX, BIM, FAS)59 were also increased (Fig. 4a-d and Extended Data Fig. 4b). TCR
sequence analysis indicated greater clonal expansion of cells in cluster 0 and 2 from severe COVID-19
patients (Fig. 4e). Overall, our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells from patients
with severe COVID-19 displayed multiple features that support the generation of robust CD8 + memory
T cell responses with pro-survival properties.

DISCUSSION
Recent studies in COVID-19 patients have verified the presence of CD8 + T cells that are reactive
to SARS-CoV-25,7,8. However, the nature and types of CD8 + T cell subsets that respond to SARS-CoV2 and whether they play an essential role in driving protective or pathogenic immune responses remain
elusive. Here, we report on the single-cell transcriptomes and TCR sequence analyses of >87,000 virusreactive CD8+ T cells from 39 COVID-19 patients and 10 healthy, pre-pandemic donors. To compare
the molecular properties of antigen-specific SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells to other common
respiratory virus-reactive CD8+ T cells, we also isolated virus-reactive CD8+ T cells from healthy control
subjects and analyzed their single-cell transcriptomes.
Across all the virus-reactive CD8+ T cells studied, we delineated eight distinct clusters with
distinct transcriptomic features that shared TCRs, suggesting a high degree of plasticity among virusreactive CD8+ T cells. We find that CD8 + memory T cells can acquire a wide range of transcriptional
programs following different viral infections. For example, in healthy subjects, CD8+ T cells with
polyfunctional features, linked to protective anti-viral immunity36-39, are abundant among CD8+ memory
T cells reactive to FLU and RSV. In contrast, these cells were mostly absent in SARS-CoV-2 responsive
cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy non-exposed subjects. Notably, cells in this
polyfunctional cluster were also significantly enriched for genes related to aerobic glycolysis, which is
considered to enhance effector functions of CD8+ memory T cells40,41.
A large fraction of SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells (43% and 37%) from healthy non-exposed
subjects (pre-pandemic), presumed to be human coronaviridae (CoV)-reactive cells that cross-react
with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools5,21, were present in clusters 1 and 0, respectively. These clusters also
had similar representation of SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from patients with COVID-19 illness. Cells in
cluster 1 showed significant positive enrichment for type 1 interferon and ‘exhaustion’ signatures,
reminiscent of the ‘exhausted’ CD8+ T cells reported in murine LCMV infection models60. Cluster 0, in
contrast, was non-exhausted and showed significant negative enrichment of exhaustion and interferon
signatures. SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from COVID-19 patients also contributed the large majority of

cells in cluster 2, which was characterized by enriched expression of cell cycle-related genes. Similar
to cells in cluster 0, cluster 2 cells also showed negative enrichment of interferon genes and relatively
lower exhaustion signature scores. Thus, we find that the nature of CD8+ T cells reactive to
coronaviridae differed substantially from those responding to FLU or RSV.
Intriguingly, COVID-19 patients broadly segregated into two groups, according to whether the
majority of the virus-reactive CD8+ memory T cells were in the ‘non-exhausted’ cluster 0 or the
‘exhausted’ cluster 1. Patients with mild COVID-19 illness had a greater proportion of SARS-CoV-2reactive cells in the ‘exhausted’ cluster 1. Besides, cells in the ‘exhausted’ subset (cluster 1) from
patients with mild COVID-19 illness expressed significantly lesser levels of transcripts encoding for
cytotoxicity molecules, Fas ligand and pro-inflammatory cytokines (CCL3, CCL4, CSF-2, TNF, LTA, and
LTB)5,9,43,44, and were significantly less clonally expanded. This finding raises the possibility that the
magnitude and quality of the ‘exhausted’ CD8+ T cell response may be clinically important for limiting
excessive tissue damage by SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 illness.
Qualitative differences also emerged between patients with mild and severe COVID-19 illness
in the ‘non-exhausted’ clusters, cluster 0 and 2. Transcripts increased in cluster 0 cells from patients
with severe illness were significantly enriched in multiple co-stimulation pathways (OX40, CD27, CD28,
4-1BB, CD40), NF- B, and cell survival pathways thought to be important for IL-2 production,
proliferation, and survival. This finding suggested that patients with severe disease mount a more
effective CD8+ memory T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that could potentially lead to durable
protection against re-exposure. Overall, our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells
from patients with severe COVID-19 displayed pro-survival properties and multiple features that
potentially support the generation of robust CD8 + memory T cell responses and a lack of restraint
reflected in the absence of an ‘exhaustion’ program. Whether these cells play a role in disease
pathogenesis or provide long-term protection is not clear, and further longitudinal analysis and
functional studies in relevant model organisms are required to clarify this.

ONLINE METHODS
Patient recruitment, ethics approval, and sample processing
The Ethics Committee of La Jolla Institute (USA) and the Berkshire Research Ethics Committee
(UK) 20/SC/0155 provided ethical approval for this study with written consent from all participants. 22
hospitalized patients with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited between April-May 2020. A cohort of 17 non-hospitalized
participants was also recruited with RT-PCR assay or serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Up to 80 ml of blood was obtained from all subjects for this research. Clinical metadata linked to
hospitalized patients such as age, gender, comorbidities, level of clinical care required, radiological
findings, and laboratory results are provided in Extended Data Table 1. The COVID-19 cohort
consisted of 30 (77%) White British/White Other, 4 (10%) Indian, 2 (5%) Black British, 2 Arab (5%), and
1 Chinese (3%) participants. Of the 39 COVID-19 subjects, 22 (56%) had moderate/severe disease
requiring hospitalization, and 17 (44%) had mild disease, not requiring hospitalization. The median age
of hospitalized patients was 60 (33-82), and 77% were male. The median age of the non-hospitalized
participants was 39 (22-50), and 47% were male. To study SARS-CoV-2-, FLU- and RSV-reactive CD8+
T cells from healthy subjects, we utilized de-identified buffy coat samples from 10 healthy adult subjects
who donated blood at the San Diego Blood Bank before 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from blood by density centrifugation over
Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) and cryopreserved in 50% human serum, 40%
complete RMPI 1640 medium and 10% DMSO.
Peptide pools
Two overlapping 15-mer SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools were purchased from Miltenyi Biotec8.
These peptide pools were derived from the immunodominant sequence of the spike glycoprotein (S)
and the complete sequence of the membrane glycoprotein (M) of SARS-CoV-2. For capturing FLU- and
RSV-reactive CD8+ T cells, PepTivator Influenza A (H1N1) and RSV strain B1 peptide pools that

covered the entire sequence of Hemagglutinin (HA) and Nucleoprotein (N) of each virus respectively,
were obtained from Miltenyi Biotec.
Antigen-reactive T cell enrichment (ARTE) assay
Virus-reactive CD8+ memory T cells were isolated using the protocol from Bacher et al. 2016
with minor modifications15. Thawed PBMC were plated overnight (5 % CO2, 37 ˚C) in 1 ml (concentration
of 5 x 106 cells/ml) of TexMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec) on 24-well culture plates. Each of the SARSCoV-2-specific peptide pools (1 µg/ml) were added separately to the PBMC culture for 24 hours. For
subsequent magnetic-based enrichment of CD137 + cells, cells were sequentially stained with human
serum IgG (Sigma Aldrich) for FcR block, cell viability dye (eFluor780/APC.Cy7, eBioscience),
Fluorescence-conjugated antibodies, Cell-hashtag TotalSeq™-C antibody (0.5 µg/condition, clone:
LNH-94;2M2, Biolegend), and a biotin-conjugated CD137 antibody (clone REA765; Miltenyi Biotec)
followed by anti-biotin microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The following fluorescence-conjugated antibodies
were used: anti-human CD3 (UCHT1, Biolegend), CD4 (OKT4, Biolegend), CD8B (SIDI8BEE,
eBioscience), CD137 (4B4-1, Biolegend), CD69 (FN50, Biolegend), CCR7 (3D12, BD Biosciences),
CD45RA (HI100, Biolegend), CD38 (HB-7, Biolegend), HLA-DR (G46-6, BD Biosciences), PD-1
(EH12.1, Biolegend). Antibody-tagged cells were added to MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) to positively
select CD137+ cells. After elution, FACSAria Fusion Cell Sorter (Becton Dickinson) was utilized to sort
CD8+ memory T cells expressing CD137 and CD69. Extended Data Fig. 1a shows the gating strategy
used for sorting. FlowJo software (v10.6.0) was employed for all Flow Cytometry Data analysis. In
parallel, virus-reactive CD4+ memory T cells were isolated from the same cultures and analysis of their
single-cell transcriptomes reported elsewhere61.
Cell isolation and single-cell RNA-seq assay (10x platform)
To facilitate the integration of single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq profiling from the sorted CD8 +
T cells, 10x Genomics 5’TAG v1.0 chemistry was utilized. A maximum of 60,000 virus-reactive CD8+

500 µL of a solution of PBS:FBS (1:1) supplemented with RNAse inhibitor (1:100). After sorting, icecold PBS was added to make up to a volume of 1400 µl. Cells were then spun down (5 min, 600 g, 4
˚C), and the supernatant was carefully aspirated, leaving 5 to 10 µl. The cell pellet was gently
resuspended in 25 µl of resuspension buffer (0.22 µm filtered ice-cold PBS supplemented with ultrapure bovine serum albumin; 0.04 %, Sigma-Aldrich). Following that, 33 µl of the cell suspension was
transferred to a PCR-tube and single-cell library prepared as per the manufacturer’s instructions (10x
Genomics).
Single-cell transcriptome analysis
Using 10x Genomics’ Cell Ranger software (v3.1.0) and the GRCh37 reference (v3.0.0)
genome, reads from single-cell RNA-seq were aligned and collapsed into Unique Molecular Identifiers
(UMI) counts. The Feature Barcoding Analysis pipeline from Cell Ranger was used to generate hashtag
UMI counts for each TotalSeq™-C antibody-capture library. UMI counts of cell barcodes were first
obtained from the raw data output, and barcodes with less than 100 UMI for the most abundant hashtag
were filtered out. Donor identities were assigned using Seurat’s (v3.1.5)62 MULTIseqDemux
(autoThresh = TRUE and maxiter = 10) with the UMI counts. Cell barcodes were classified into three
categories: donor ID (singlet), Doublet, Negative enrichment. Singlet cells were then stringently reclassified as doublet if the ratio of UMI counts between the top 2 barcodes was less than 3. All cells that
were not classified as doublets or negative were used for downstream analysis. Cells from two COVID19 patients with mild disease (patient 28 and 48) were not identifiable in the downstream analyses due
to the lack of cell hashtags.
Single-cell RNA-Seq libraries (N = 15) were aggregated using Cell Ranger’s aggr function
(v3.1.0). Analysis of the combined data was carried out in the R statistical environment using the
package Seurat (v3.1.5). To filter out doublets and to eliminate cells with low-quality transcriptomes,
cells were excluded if they were expressing < 800 or > 4400 unique genes, had < 1500 or > 20,000
total UMI content, and > 10% of mitochondrial UMIs. The summary statistics for each single-cell

transcriptome library are given in Extended Data Table 3 and show good quality data with no major
differences in quality control metrics between batches (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Only transcripts
expressed in at least 0.1% of the cells were included for further analysis. Using default settings in Seurat
software, the filtered transcriptome data was then normalized (by a factor of 10,000) and logtransformed per cell. The top variable genes with a mean expression greater than 0.01 counts per
million (CPM) and explaining 25% of the total variance were selected using the Variance Stabilizing
Transformation method62. The transcriptomic data was then further scaled by regressing the number of
UMIs detected, and the percentage of mitochondrial counts per cell. Principal component analysis was
performed using the top variable genes, and based on the standard deviation of the principal
components portrayed as an “elbow plot”, the first 25 principal components (PCs) were selected for
downstream analyses. Cells were clustered using the FindNeighbors, and FindClusters functions in
Seurat with a resolution of 0.2. The robustness of clustering was verified by other clustering methods
and by modifying the number of PCs and variable genes utilized for clustering. Analysis of clustering
patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ T cells across multiple batches revealed no evidence of strong
batch effects (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Plots to visualize normalized UMI data were created using the
Seurat package and custom R scripts.
Single-cell differential gene expression analysis
MAST package in R (v1.8.2)63 was used to perform pair-wise single-cell differential gene
expression analysis after converting UMI data to log2(CPM+1). For genes to be considered differentially
expressed, the following thresholds were used: Benjamini-Hochberg–adjusted P-value < 0.05 and a
log2 fold change greater than 0.25. Cluster markers (transcripts enriched in a given cluster) were
determined using the function FindAllMarkers from Seurat.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Signature Module Scores
Signature lists were extracted from published data sets and databases. Gene names from
murine datasets were converted to human gene names using the biomaRt R package. Gene lists were

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.09.194027; this version posted July 10, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

then filtered to exclude genes that were expressed (CPM > 0) in < 2 % of the cells. Exhaustion
consensus signature list was derived by considering genes that were present in > 3 exhaustion
signature datasets23-31 (Extended Data Table 5). Genes that were present in cytotoxicity signatures 23,64
or viral activation signatures57 were then excluded from this consensus list. The R package fgsea was
used to calculate the GSEA scores with the signal-to-noise ratio as a metric. Default parameters other
than minSize = 3 and maxSize = 500 were used. Normalized enrichment scores were presented as
enrichment plots.
Signature scores were estimated with the Seurat’s AddModuleScore function, using default
settings. For a given cell, each signature score is defined by the mean of the gene list of interest minus
the mean expression of control gene lists. Control gene lists were sampled (size equal to the signature
list) from bins defined based on the level of expression of the genes in the signature list. Signature gene
lists used for analysis are provided in Extended Data Table 5.
Single-cell trajectory analysis
Monocle 3 (v0.2.1)65 was used to calculate the “branched” trajectory; settings included the
number of UMI and percentage of mitochondrial UMI as the model formula, and taking the highly
variable genes from Seurat for consistency. After using the PCA output from Seurat and allocating a
single partition for all cells, the cell-trajectory was outlined on the UMAP generated from Seurat as well.
The ‘root’ was assigned using the get_earliest_principal_node function given in the package’s tutorial.
T cell receptor (TCR) sequence analysis
Single-cell libraries enriched for V(D)J TCR sequences were processed to get clonotype
information for each independent sample with the vdj pipeline from Cell Ranger (v3.1.0 and human
annotations reference GRCh38, v3.1.0, as recommended). Joint analysis of single-cell transcriptomes
and TCR repertoires was performed by aggregating independent libraries through custom scripts. For
this purpose, cell barcodes were matched between corresponding libraries from each type. Then, each

unique clonotype, a set of productive Complementarity-Determining Region 3 (CDR3) sequences as
defined by 10x Genomics, was identified across all library annotations files. Finally, clone statistics,
mainly clonotypes’ frequencies, and proportions were recalculated for the whole aggregation
(considering only cells found in both modalities) so that previously-identified good quality cells were
annotated with a specific clonotype ID and such clone statistics. Clone size was calculated as the
number of cells expressing a given clonotype ID, and a clonotype was called as clonally expanded if
this value was greater than 1 (clone size ≥ 2). Clone size was depicted on UMAP (per cell) or violin
plots (per group, where color indicated clone size median of each group) using custom scripts, and
clonotype sharing was presented using the tools from UpSetR66.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
IPA was performed using the default setting (v01-16) on transcripts that were significantly
increased in expression in cluster 0 cells from patients with severe COVID-19 illness compared to mild
illness. The canonical pathway analysis was performed to elucidate the enriched pathways in this data
set and to visualize and highlight the gene overlap between the given data set with a particular enriched
pathway. The upstream regulator network analysis was used to identify and visualize the interactions
between differentially expressed downstream target genes in a given dataset with a particular upstream
regulator.
Statistical Analysis
Graphpad Prism 8.4.3 software was utilized for relevant data statistical analysis. Detailed
information regarding statistical analysis, including test types and number of batches or samples is
provided in the figure legends. P values are specified in the text or the figure legends. The data normality
tests were performed, and for data that fell within Gaussian distribution, appropriate parametric
statistical tests were performed. For those that did not conform to the equal variance-Gaussian
distribution, appropriate non-parametric statistical tests were used.
