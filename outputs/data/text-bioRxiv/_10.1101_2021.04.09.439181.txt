ABSTRACT
The novel β-coronavirus has caused sad losses worldwide and the emergence of new
variants has been causing great concern. Thus throughout this research the lineage
B.1.1.28 of clade P.2 (K417N, N501Y, E484K) that emerged in Brazil was studied
but also in a less depth the P.1 lineage, where through simulations of molecular
dynamics in the NAMD 3 algorithm in the 8ns interval it was possible to understand the thermodynamic impacts in the interaction of the ACE2-RBD complex
and the neutralizing antibody RBD-IgG. From the molecular dynamics, we noticed
that the RMSF averages in the P.2 strain were more expressive in comparison to
the ACE2-RBD wild-type and consequently some regions have undergone more expressive conformational changes although, in general, a greater stabilization of the
complex was perceived. In addition, was an increase in the average number of Hydrogen bonds generating a lower RMSD and greater system compaction measured
by Radius of Gyration (Rg). The change in native contacts was also important
where the decrease from 0.992 ± 0.002 to 0.988 ± 0.002 reﬂects structural changes,
which could reﬂect in greater transmissibility and diﬃculty in recognizing neutralizing antibodies. Through the MM-PBSA decomposition, we found that Van der

Waals interactions predominated and were more favorable when the structure has
mutations of the P.2 lineage. Therefore we believe that the greater stabilization of
the ACE2-RBD complex may be a plausible explanation of why some mutations are
converging in diﬀerent lineages such as E484K and N501Y.

1. Introduction
In January 2021, Brazilian researchers identiﬁed a novel variant of the coronavirus,
called P.1 (20J/501Y.V3), during a period of unprecedented increase in hospitalizations
and incidence in cases of reinfection in the city of Manaus, where it was shown to
be correlated with the emergence of novel lineage. From the genetic sequencing, it
consists of multiple mutations, among the most worrying are 3 (three) that aﬀected
the RBD region of Spike glycoprotein: K417N, E484K and N501Y (Naveca et al.,
2021). The P.1 strain identiﬁed has many similarities with the discovery in the United
Kingdom B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2 or VOC-202012/01). Since there has been an increase
in transmissibility by 1.4-2.2 times, in addition to the greater probability of lethality
by 1.1-1.8 times (Coutinho et al., 2021; Faria et al., 2021). According to data from the
Epidemiological Surveillance System in Brazil in relation to the ﬁrst three months of
2021, it was noticed that in the age groups from 30 to 39 years old there was an increase
in cases by 565.08%, while in the age group from 40 to 49 years for a rate of 626%.
Finally, when analyzing the death rate, the data are less expressive. Consequently,
there is a shift towards younger age groups while the number of occurrences at older
ages has been reduced (Castro, 2021).
The P.2 lineage evolved independently in Rio de Janeiro without being directly
related to the P.1 lineage (Voloch et al., 2021). We should note that the P.2 and
South African lineage have exactly the same mutations in common in the RBD region
of the Spike protein. In South Africa, lineage B.1.351 emerged whose studies report
greater diﬃculty in the recognition of antibodies (Moyo-Gwete et al., 2021; P. Wang
et al., 2021). It is then constituted by eight mutations in the protein Spike, being 3
(three) of these: K417N, E484K and N501Y. It is noticeable the convergence of some

mutations, speciﬁcally in position E484. Thus, several variants of the coronavirus,
whether identiﬁed in South Africa, Brazil or the United Kingdom, carry this same
mutation.
First of all, we have to highlight that theoretical and computational chemistry techniques are essential to see what is often inaccessible experimentally or even to provide
new insights into the most intrinsic molecular mechanisms of a given phenomenon.
Thus, molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool for understanding the
mechanisms involved in biomolecular interactions. Although, it is known that the precision of the results depends essentially on the elapsed time of simulation in addition to
the precision of the adopted force ﬁeld (Durrant & McCammon, 2011). In this research
we studied the P.2 variant impact using simulations of atomistic molecular dynamics (all-atom) for the ACE2-RBD and antibody-antigen complexes to ﬁnd theoretical
explanations of the causes of the increase in viral transmissibility or even severity of
symptoms. In the end, we analyzed the RMSF atomic ﬂuctuations, RMSD stability,
formed Hydrogen bonds and SASA value of solvent exposure in the ACE2-RBD interaction. In addition, the non-covalent terms of molecular mechanics �EM M � were also
estimated in addition to the total solvation energy by decomposing MM-PBSA energy.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Mutagenesis in silico
As a result of the unavailability of crystallographic structures containing the mutations of the P.2 lineage (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that arose in Brazil, ﬁrst it was
necessary to use reference structures from the RCSB Protein Data Bank database
(https://www.rcsb.org/) (Berman et al., 2000) where amino acid substitutions
would be applied. The in silico mutation was performed in the PyMOL 2.3 software (Schrödinger, LLC, 2015) with the module “Mutagenesis” (see Figure 1) having
the rotamer with lowest steric tension automatically deﬁned by the software. In addition, the standard rotamer library was adopted, being dependent on the φ and ψ
angles of the backbone. The prediction of new conformation of ACE2-RBD (PDB ID:
6M0J) (X. Wang et al., 2020) and antibody-antigen (PDB ID: 7BWJ) (Ju et al., 2020)

with P.2 mutations was performed with Branch-and-Prune implementation algorithm.
After the insertion of mutations, it was necessary to remove steric clashes between
the atoms and thus was performed molecular dynamics simulations to minimize and
equilibrate the resulting structure.

Figure 1. Insertion of the N501Y mutation is presented, belonging to the P.1/P.2 strains and applied to
the ACE2-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J). The software PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC, 2015) was used for
mutagenesis and presented a probability of tension at the best rotamer with a score of 31.18. The small green
disks denote atoms that are almost in a steric or subtly overlapping conﬂict. On the other hand, the large red
discs indicate a signiﬁcant overlap of the Van der Waals radius.

In parallel, the I-Mutant 3.0 (Capriotti, Fariselli, & Casadio, 2005) tool was used,
which implements the SVM machine-learning approach to predict ΔΔG as a result of
the emerging variants in the ACE2-Spike complex (PDB ID: 7DF4) and neutralizing
antibodies RBD-Ty1 (PDB ID: 6ZXN) where we adopt the physiological condition at
pH = 7.4, temperature of 25◦ C and SVM3 ternary classiﬁcation algorithm where it
denotes stability (ΔΔG ≥ +0.5kcal·mol−1 ), destabilization (ΔΔG ≤ −0.5kcal·mol−1 )
and neutrality (−0.5kcal·mol−1 ≤ ΔΔG ≤ +0.5kcal·mol−1 ). It is noted that although
not all authors denote the positive sign as stabilization, it was agreed in this work that:

2.2. Parameters of molecular dynamics
In this step, atomistic simulations (all-atom) of molecular dynamics were performed
in the ACE2-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) (X. Wang et al., 2020) in front of the lineage B.1.1.28/P.2 (E484K, K417N, N501Y). We also studied the impact of P.2 on the
interaction with speciﬁc neutralizing antibodies for RBD (PDB ID: 7BWJ) (Ju et al.,
2020) that were derived from B lymphocytes from patients infected with SARS-CoV2. All proteins were previously prepared with the software in its version for academic
purposes Schrödinger Maestro 2020-4 using the ”Protein Preparation” module, a step
that included adjustments in ionization states, removal of water molecules, cofactors,
assignment of partial charges and addition of Hydrogen atoms to the structure. The
generation of all input and conﬁguration ﬁles was done using the QwikMD 1.3 (Ribeiro
et al., 2016) plugin implementing in the VMD 1.9.4.48a (Humphrey, Dalke, & Schulten, 1996) graphical interface. The complex was immersed in a solvation box (see
Figure 2) with cubic geometry and applying PBC (periodic boundary conditions) containing water molecules described by the TIP3P model at a standard distance of 12.0
� in relation to the frontiers of the box, as well as the addition of N a+ and Cl−

counterions to neutralize the system at a physiological molar concentration of 0.15
mol · L−1 . Meanwhile, all topology ﬁles were generated with the CHARMM36 (Huang
& MacKerell Jr, 2013) force ﬁeld.
The system was minimized using 1000 steps with conjugate gradient approach.
Shortly thereafter, there was gradual heating of 60-300K at the rate of 1K · ps−1 over
1ns under the NPT ensemble and then the system was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble with steepest descent algorithm. Finally, the trajectory calculation step used the
integration of Verlet in an NPT thermodynamic cycle with the elapsed time of 8ns and
recording every 20ps. Hoover’s stochastic piston was used for pressure control similar
to a barostat under the standard conditions of 1.01325Bar, period of 200f s and decay
time with 100f s. While a Langevin dynamic thermostat was adopted with a coupling

coeﬃcient of τp = 1ps−1 . In addition, long-range electrostatic interactions were estimated according to the Particle-Mesh-Ewald (PME) formalism while the SHAKE
(Kräutler, van Gunsteren, & Hünenberger, 2001) algorithm was used to restrict covalent bonds between hydrogens along of the simulation. Finally, the NAMD3 (Nanoscale
Molecular Dynamics) (Phillips et al., 2020) algorithm was used to run all simulations
with acceleration of the Nvidia GTX 1050 2 GB GPU with 640 CUDA cores at a
time-step of 2f s. As a result of computational limitations, studies of mutations were
restricted to the RBD region (229 amino acids) instead of the entire Spike receptor
(1273 amino acids).
In the end, the conformational changes in the macromolecule as a result of the
mutations were measured, through the temporal evolution RMSD and RMSF of the
atomic displacement in relation to the Cα of the ACE2-RBD complex where frame
0 was adopted as a reference. The analysis of trajectories and construction of RMSD
and RMSF graphics were possible with the MDAnalysis (Michaud-Agrawal, Denning,
Woolf, & Beckstein, 2011) and Matplotlib libraries implemented in the Python 3 programming language with the Shrake and Rupley algorithm (Shrake & Rupley, 1973).
The fraction of native contacts was calculated based on the ﬁrst frame of the MD
simulations as a native conformation. Throughout the analysis of native contacts, the

The estimation of the error in the RMSD, RMSF, SASA and Hydrogen bonds
values were based on the standard deviation of the measurements over time. We
used the Scipy library in Python for all statistical analysis with the command
ttest ind(a, b, equal var = F alse), where (a, b) denote two matrices containing the
molecular dynamics RMS data. We analyzed the statistical signiﬁcance of the comparative results using the two-way Student t-test to conﬁrm the hypothesis of the
diﬀerence between two means (µ1 �= µ2 ) of the RMSD and RMSF values obtained
from a set of statistically independent data and variance σ12 �= σ22 . We considered the
value p < 0.05 for a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence for a conﬁdence interval of 95%.
Regarding the impact of the P.2 strain on the recognition of antibodies, one complex antigen-antibody was subjected to molecular dynamics simulations in the range
of 12ns and later the mean values of RMSD, RMSF, SASA, in addition to formed
hydrogen bonds.

solvation terms were estimated for the ACE2-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) in the
presence and absence of the P.2 strain, in which the explicit water molecules and ions
were previously removed for analysis. We used the NAMDEnergy plugin to calculate
EM M while the term �SASA� was previously obtained by the MDTraj library. From

component of Poisson-Boltzmann was estimated for

the last frame by the ﬁnite diﬀerence method using the DelPhi v8.4.5 algorithm (Li et
al., 2012) with a 0.0001 convergence criterion, in a 0.10M solution having a dielectric
constant for the solute with � = 2.0 and for the solvent the water dielectric constant was
� = 80.0. It is important to note that the polar solvation term was considered implicit
continuum solvation by the DelPhi algorithm. As a result of the high computational
complexity and the inherent uncertainty in the estimation of the entropic term T · ΔS,
we did not include the MM-PB(SA) decomposition of this research.
The equation to estimate the polar contribution corresponds to the ﬁnite diﬀerence
of the solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PB) (Homeyer & Gohlke, 2012;
C. Wang, Greene, Xiao, Qi, & Luo, 2018):

The entropic term is generally estimated only by normal or quasi-harmonic analysis
and is the most complex component to obtain. The nonpolar solvation free energy
stems from Van der Waals interactions between the solute and the solvent. The value
of SASA denotes the surface area accessible to the solvent:

Branch-and-Prune (BP). It is therefore a method that lists all possible atoms and positions while discarding invalid ones. After mutagenesis and protein reconstruction, it
was ﬁnally possible to perform the various analyzes of chemical interactions, molecular
dynamics and MM-PBSA decomposition.
Through an analysis with the aid of the I-Mutant 3.0 tool (Capriotti et al., 2005),
the global value of ΔΔG in the ACE2-RBD structure (PDB ID: 7DF4) as a result
of the 3 (three) mutations that constitute the Amazonian lineage B.1.1.28/P.1 was
−1.85kcal · mol−1 where: N501Y (−0.08kcal · mol−1 ); K417T (−1.50kcal · mol−1 );
E484K (−0.27kcal · mol−1 ). Thus we can see that the N501Y mutation that appeared
in the UK a priori would not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the ACE2-RBD interaction. The
same conclusion refers to the E484K mutation in South Africa that did not reach
the critical threshold of −0.5kcal · mol−1 . On the other hand, K417T that emerged
in Amazonas generated an unexpected destabilization in the ACE2-RBD recognition,
which although it can decrease the probability of cell invasion could make it diﬃcult to
recognize neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccines. In addition, the critical destabilization due to K417T could have a correlation with the unprecedented increase
in January, 2021 in infections and deaths in Amazonas due to COVID-19. The P.2
clade lineage is distinguished by the K417N mutation that generates less signiﬁcant
destabilization although still critical of −1.35kcal · mol−1 . It is noted that mutations
where there is destabilization tend to disappear due to evolutionary pressure since they
cause a negative impact on the protein function (Ancien, Pucci, Godfroid, & Rooman,
2018). We must note that these instability results are only predictions, and only with
molecular dynamics can we be more convinced of the conclusions. As reported in the
literature, the phenomenon of stability is proportional to a lower conformational entropy, but it is not possible to infer that greater stability is necessarily related to
greater severity of the disease.
In order to have greater conﬁdence in the stability results of the ACE2-RBD complex, we predicted ΔΔG using the mCSM (Pires, Ascher, & Blundell, 2013) tool
where: N501Y (−0.757kcal · mol−1 ); K417T (−1.594 kcal · mol−1 ); E484K (−0.081
kcal · mol−1 ). Again, the K417T mutation of the P.1 lineage showed a critical destabilization, as occurred in the I-Mutant 3.0 tool. When the P.2 lineage was analyzed, the

K417T mutation generated a critical destabilization of −1.582 kcal · mol−1 providing
preliminary evidences of changes in residue Lys417 in the Spike protein may be the
main responsible for the increase in the transmissibility of the virus in the Amazonas.
Through the tool DynaMut2 (Rodrigues, Pires, & Ascher, 2021) it was possible to
understand the impact of mutations on chemical bonds (see Figure 3). The K417N
mutation belonging to the P.2 lineage is considered destabilizing as a result of the loss
of 1 (one) Hydrogen bond, 3 (three) hydrophobic contacts in addition to 2 (two) polar
interactions at the ACE2-RBD interface. The same pattern was observed in the P.1
lineage with the K417T mutation, although with greater stability as a result of having lost fewer interactions with the disappearance of 1 (one) hydrogen bond, 1 (one)
hydrophobic contact and 1 (one) interaction polar.

as a result of the K417T and K417N mutations related to the P.1 and P.2 lineages, respectively. All diagrams
were generated on the DynaMut2 (Rodrigues et al., 2021) platform. The dashed lines in green represent the
hydrophobic contacts, the lines in red correspond to the Hydrogen bonds and ﬁnally the color orange refers to
the polar interactions.

Through the aid of the PDBePISA platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/
prot int/pistart.html) (Krissinel, 2010), a worrying mutation in the B.1.1.28/P.1
and P.2 lineages would be the same that aﬀected the United Kingdom. In this, the
N501Y mutation resulted in the formation of a hydrogen bond (−OH) between the

� which would explain the Δi G ≈ −6.5
Tyr501-Lys353 residues at a distance of 2.90A
kcal · mol−1 compared to the wild-type structure where Δi G ≈ −5.9 kcal · mol−1 . This
was perhaps the cause of the greatest transmissibility in the British lineage B.1.1.7,
but it would also indicate a priori that all lineages emerged in Brazil would also be
characterized by an increase in transmissibility because it shares similar mutations
to other strains around the world. Exposure to water molecules in the Spike protein

tool through the last frame resulting from the MD simulations. Consequently, the
greater probability of hydrophobic contacts in P.2 provides an increase in stability
and therefore causes an increase in the aﬃnity of interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In addition, the P.2 strain would make the Spike protein more soluble due to a higher
SASA value, which could facilitate interaction with the ACE2 receptor. It is important
to note that these results refer only to the last frame, and that is why it was essential
that we also evaluate the average value �SASA� later with molecular dynamics on (see
Table 1).
When analyzing the RBD-Ty1 interaction (PDB ID: 6ZXN) with the mutations
present in the P.1 strain, a destabilizing behavior was found, which reﬂects a less interaction between the Spike glycoprotein and monoclonal antibodies so that: N501Y
(0.35kcal · mol−1 ); K417T (−0.90kcal · mol−1 ); E484K (−0.50kcal · mol−1 ). Among
all the results, the most worrying is precisely the K417T mutation that emerged
in South Africa, which presents a critical destabilization and may a priori hamper the immune response through the administration of vaccines. Regarding the P.2
strain, the K417N mutation showed lower stability compared to the K417T, resulting in −0.82kcal · mol−1 . Lastly, when we performed the protein-protein docking on
the HDock platform (http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/) (Yan, Zhang, Zhou, Li, &
Huang, 2017) for the ACE2-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J) containing the lineage
P.2, it was noticeable a greater aﬃnity with a relative score of −311.75 while in the
absence of mutations it was −310.19. These results corroborate the hypothesis that P.2
really makes Spike interaction with the ACE2 cell receptor more expressive. On the

Duhovny, Inbar, Nussinov, & Wolfson, 2005) P.2 mutations also reﬂected an increase
in aﬃnity in the ACE2-RBD complex where the score increased from 15206 to 15356
compared to the reference structure. When analyzing all the mutations that constitute
P.1/P.2, we realized that the N501Y mutation was the only one that directly aﬀected
the antibody-antigen interface although the value of ΔΔG was not signiﬁcant, because
otherwise, the harm to patients could be even greater than it currently is.

3.1.1. Impact of P.2 through MD analysis
It should be noted that the mutations that constitute the South African strain affected the same positions in the RBD region of the Spike protein in relation to the
Brazilian strain B.1.1.28/P.2. Thus, the simulations presented here will present similar
conclusions for both strains. Although molecular dynamics is a rigorous approach to
study the interaction of biomolecules, it is necessary to calculate as many trajectories
as possible to minimize statistical errors. Thus although the results presented here
have a relatively short time of 8ns for ACE2-RBD and 12ns for RBD-IgG, we believe
that the results are consistent and relevant. Despite the widespread use of MD simulations, little statistical approach is used to attest to the signiﬁcance of the results
and to minimize subjectivity in the conclusions. This may be due mainly to the large
sampling of data resulting from molecular dynamics, which tends to make statistically
signiﬁcant even very small variations. A similar approach is found in the literature that
used ANOVA to study the impacts on the activation of the GPCR protein (Bruzzese,
Dalton, & Giraldo, 2020). For this reason, we used the Student’s t-test to conﬁrm
whether the diﬀerences in the conformational ﬂuctuations of the P.2 strain are really
signiﬁcant. Our criterion for quantifying the inﬂuence of structural ﬂexibility in the
presence and absence of the P.2 strain was the value of RMSD and also for the analysis
as a function of amino acids by RMSF. This diﬀerence corresponds to the variation
of the average values RMSD and RMSF between the structure with the mutations
of P.2 and the wild-type structure, which was important for the tests of statistical
signiﬁcance (see Supplementary Material ).
We performed the superposition of the last frame obtained from the molecular dynamics referring to the P.2 lineage and the respective original crystallographic struc14

Through RMSF analyzes it is possible to know the ﬂuctuation variation around a

that emerged in South Africa was the most worrisome because it induced greater
conformational changes in the Spike protein, although it may be only because it is
a naturally more unstable position and perhaps that is why it is more susceptible to
mutations. The greater stabilization in the ACE2-RBD complex as a result of certain
mutations may be an explanation of why the virus has been following a convergent
evolution as already reported in some experimental studies (Bobay, O’Donnell, &
Ochman, 2020; Hodcroft et al., 2021; Kemp et al., 2021; Lam et al., 2020), although
the causes until still unknown. Through the simulations of this work, we conclude that
there is a tendency towards greater structural stability in the most frequent mutations.
In other words, the mutations that have been recurring in several strains such as E484K
tend to have greater stability.

the ﬂuctuation diﬀerences may be partly a consequence of a new velocity distribution
associated with each simulation performed, the mutations indeed contributed to an
increase in conformational changes in some very speciﬁc regions. This is because, when
analyzing only the average of ﬂuctuations (see Table 1), a lower RMSD is noticeable
in P.2 and therefore greater stability. Consequently, our hypothesis is that the increase
in transmissibility it may be correlated with greater aﬃnity in the interaction of the
ACE2-RBD complex as a consequence of the highest stability. It seems paradoxical
that although P.2 presents comparatively larger peaks of ﬂuctuations, the average
RMSD was lower compared to the structure absent from mutations. Despite everything, it is consolidated in the literature that in the protein-protein interaction, greater
stabilization is the main factor for increasing aﬃnity. Therefore, the possible explanation for the highest peak is an indication that some very speciﬁc regions tend to
suﬀer more from the impact of mutations, although at the global level there are fewer
ﬂuctuations. Finally, at the same time that the Spike protein becomes more ﬂexible in
some regions as a result of P.2, it may be indicative of greater exposure to neutralizing
antibodies, although there may be a decrease in the aﬃnity of interaction due to the
RMSF instability of the system.

for the RBD-IgG complex (PDB ID: 7BWJ) structure was only at the last frame, as a result of computational
limitations, and the algorithm used was DelPhi instead of the MDTraj library.

the absence of mutations can be associated with a greater probability of detachment
of the Spike protein with the ACE2 receptor interface. In addition, α-helices for being present in naturally unstable positions were the ones that presented the highest
conformational ﬂuctuations, and that also suﬀered the direct eﬀects of the mutations.

that this region was the one that showed the greatest ﬂuctuation among all amino
acids regardless of the presence of mutations. Therefore, these data possibly reﬂect an
increase in the ACE2-RBD interaction due to lower RMSD displacements as a result
of the multiple mutations that make up the P.2 strain.
Regarding the analysis of the formation of Hydrogen bonds over the ACE2-RBD
simulation (see Figure 5), it was found that the P.2 strain had an average (see Table 1)
of 203 ± 11 · · · H bonds and in the absence there was a decrease to 200 ± 12 on average
bonds. When analyzing the formation of saline bridges, it was noticed that only the
wild-type structure formed 2 (two) interactions in the ACE2-RBD interface between
the residues: RBD: Glu484 → ACE2: Lys31 and RBD: Lys417 → ACE2: Asp30. On
the other hand, the structure containing P.2 has lost these interactions. Consequently,
we can conclude that Hydrogen bonds play a fundamental role in the stabilization
of P.2 to the detriment of saline bridges. Therefore, the formation of more chemical
interactions, especially hydrogen bonds, therefore seems to increase the structural
stability of P.2. In summary, there seems to be a favoring of this lineage so that there
is a greater ACE2-RBD interaction.

Figure 5. Impact on the formation of hydrogen bonds in the ACE2-RBD complex as a result of the P.2
lineage.

When analyzing the total SASA value over time (see Figure 6) the diﬀerences were
not statistically signiﬁcant where P.2 presented an average equal to (2218.7 ± 5.3)nm2
diﬀering only (+0.4nm2 ) compared to the wild-type structure. Therefore this an indication that exposure to the solvent was not aﬀected by the mutations that make
up the P.2 strain. From the joint analysis of RMSD, RMSF, SASA and Hydrogen
bonds, in general, it can be seen that mutations of the P.2 strain have stabilized the
ACE2-RBD structure, although in some central residues an increase in structural ﬂexibility has been noted according to RMSF analysis. Finally, it is important to highlight
that 3 (three) analyzes corroborate the hypothesis of greater stability ACE2-RBD as
a result of P.2, among them: Average values of RMSD, Hydrogen bonding and Radius of Gyration (Rg). While only 2 (two) analyzes reﬂect the hypothesis of greater
instability, these being: Average values of RMSF and native contacts. However, we
must remember that the average RMSF value is natural to be more unstable in face
of more expressive peak values as a result of the mutations, although in general we
can conclude that stability is in fact the main conclusion for the transmissibility and
virulence changes of P.2.

6M0J) in view of the mutations that make up the P.2 strain.

Firstly as a result of the ACE2-RBD interaction being a temperature-dependent
process as discovered in the research (He, Tao, Yan, Huang, & Xiao, 2020) so the
premises ΔH < 0 and ΔS < 0 are possibly true. Furthermore, it is known that
Coronaviruses tend to spread with a higher incidence, even more negative values of
ΔG < 0, due to the seasonality in winter. Consequently, we can conclude that the
P.2 lineage, being more stable, will have less diﬃculty in overcoming the entropic
penalty because greater aﬃnity leads to a reduction in conformational entropy. This
stems from the equation that describes the free binding energy between two proteins:
ΔG = ΔH − T · ΔS. As the term −T · ΔS becomes even more positive as a result of
less structural stability, the free energy of binding tends to be less spontaneous and
the aﬃnity of interaction becomes less expressive with the increase of temperature. In
other words, the entropic penalty of free energy decreases in proportion to structural
stability. The increased compaction of the ACE2-RBD complex as a result of the P.2
strain could also make the enthalpy variation more negative a hypothesis veriﬁed by
the MM-PBSA decomposition, which will lead to a greater propensity for proteolytic
activation of the virus.
A greater deviation from native contacts as a result of the P.2 lineage was noticeable
in the ACE2-RBD complex (see Figure 7), decreasing from 0.992 ± 0.002 to 0.988 ±
0.002. This therefore indicates notable and statistically signiﬁcant structural changes

(p < 0.05). Thus, these modiﬁcations may have a correlation to the appearance of a
phenotypic characteristic where there is greater viral transmissibility in similar strains
such as P.1 and B.1.1.351 as reported in an important study (Faria et al., 2021).

When performing a statistical comparison using the Student’s t-test, the Pearson’s
coeﬃcient value was p < 0.05 within the 95 % conﬁdence interval, thus showing a
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the groups analyzed. Although the statistical
approach was important to minimize subjectivity in the interpretation of the results,
it is important to note that the p coeﬃcient cannot be seen as something absolute
or that the diﬀerences are necessarily statistically signiﬁcant (Wasserstein, Schirm, &
Lazar, 2019). In spite of everything, the current paradigm is that strains similar to
P.2, mainly P.1 lineage, really generated an increase in transmissibility and lethality
(Faria et al., 2021), and consequently we seek to see this in the results through the
greater ACE2-RBD aﬃnity, compaction and system stabilization as a consequence of
P.2 lineage.

Through the simulations of molecular dynamics in the NAMD 3 algorithm, it was
possible to understand the impacts of the P.2 strain on the eﬀectiveness of neutralizing antibody in the interaction with the Spike protein (RBD). From the individual
analysis of RMSF ﬂuctuations associated with each residue, the impact of the P.2
strain was realized so that the E484K mutation in the RBD-IgG complex (PDB ID:

Again these results were repeated for N501Y where the change was 1.653A

In this way, it seems that a characteristic of P.2 is precisely to induce less stability
in the interaction with neutralizing antibodies, which reﬂects in less aﬃnity of the
interaction. Furthermore, it was noticed a decrease of 1 (one) saline bridge during the
MD simulations, where the RBD-IgG complex (PDB ID: 7BWJ) lost the interactions
between the residues RBD: Glu484 → Heavy Chain: Arg112 and RBD: Glu484 →
Light Chain: Lys55 although it formed RBD: Lys484 → Light Chain: Glu52. This
therefore reﬂects a possible decrease in the interaction of neutralizing antibodies due
to greater instability in the antibody-antigen complex. Lastly, the alignment of the
crystallographic structure of the RBD-IgG complex (PDB ID: 7BWJ) with the last
frame resulting from the molecular dynamics with P.2, resulted in an RMSD value

In general, almost all comparisons were statistically signiﬁcant, with the exception
of the SASA value. In order to justify the validity of the t-test approach employed, the
Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed for the number of hydrogen bonds, as a
test example, with a minimum conﬁdence interval of 87 %. Levene’s test was applied
to verify equality between variances where p > 0.05, and therefore the inequality had
to be considered throughout the hypothesis test. Consequently, we believe that the
T-Test formalism proposal for the analysis of MD simulations is justiﬁed. Regarding
the RMSD and RMSF data set, the conﬁdence interval of 95% was adopted. Finally,
we must note that the results of any computational simulation must always be seen
with the perspective that the improvement of the force ﬁelds and algorithms is continuous, and therefore these results are provisional until corroborated by more in-depth
theoretical studies or by means of experimental techniques.

3.1.2. MM-PBSA decomposition results
The Van der Waals interaction and electrostatic energy were estimated in addition to
the solvation energy. Thus, will help us to better understand the theoretical causes of
the greater stability of the ACE2-RBD complex as a result of P.2 mutations. Throughout the discussion of the results (see Figure 3.1.2), we focused on the terms that make
up the �EM M � energy between the RBD chain and the ACE2 receptor, instead of
the ΔGbinding because it would require accurate estimation of the entropic term. We
consider that the internal energy component of molecular mechanics did not make
a signiﬁcant contribution, therefore approaching zero. The favorable formation and
greater stability of the ACE2-RBD complex as a function of P.2 may be correlated
mainly with even smaller terms of the energy of Van der Waals �EV dW �. Apparently,
Van der Waals contribution (see Figure 9) has been playing a central role in a greater
formation of intermolecular bonds in the complex containing P.2.

ACE2-RBD complex (PDB ID: 6M0J).

In terms of polar solvation, the impact of the P.2 strain was more notable compared
to non-polar solvation where the diﬀerence was not signiﬁcant. However, the polar solvation free energy GP B favored the interaction of the wild-type complex much more,
which could explain the greater instability and greater interaction with the surrounding environment instead of the ACE2 cell receptor. The unexpected results for electrostatic interactions may be a consequence of the numerous ﬂuctuations in the energy
�Eelec � that characterized the wild-type structure ranging from −335.89 kcal · mol−1
up to +176.07 kcal · mol−1 , and therefore increasing the instability of the ACE2-RBD
system. Therefore, Van der Waals interactions are the most prevalent when comparing
energy data between the complex containing and absent P.2 mutations. After estimating the molecular energy and solvation, it is ﬁnally possible to obtain the enthalpy
H associated with the system. Thus, we realized that the P.2 strain unexpectedly
had the less favorable enthalpic term compared to the reference structure, suggesting
that greater ACE2-RBD interaction is correlated to less negative enthalpy but that
it will possibly reﬂect in a more favorable and therefore greater ΔH and spontaneity
of ΔGbinding . Finally, we must highlight that the energy values presented are very
dependent on the methodology used. Consequently, numerical values should only be
seen in a qualitative way for the impact of P.2 instead of absolute quantitative.

3.1.3. Impacts on electrostatic distribution
Based on the physico-chemical properties inherent to each amino acid (Nelson & Cox,
2017), we realized that the transition from the Lys417 residue (pI ≈ 9.47) positively
charged, of a polar character and basic pH to the amino acid Asn417 (pI ≈ 5.41) also
polar although electrically neutral would increase the likelihood of hydrogen bonding
at the expense of saline bridges. The substitution of the amino acid Asn501 for Tyr501
(pI ≈ 5.63) apparently would not induce signiﬁcant diﬀerences since both are polar
and electrically neutral, therefore having similar probabilities in the formation of hydrogen bonds, except that Tyrosine has an amphipathic character. Finally, the amino
acid Glu484 (pI ≈ 3.08) of a nonpolar character, acidic in addition to being negatively charged when changed by Lys484 with a positive net electrical charge and basic
character could therefore alter the electrostatic distribution around it and increase the
probability of solubility both in acidic and alkaline conditions where pI > pH. From
the electrostatic distribution surface (see Figure 10) calculated by the APBS (Adap-

tive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) algorithm (Jurrus et al., 2018), we can see that the P.2
strain contributed to there being regions with a more negative potential (−597.134 to
+549.126) possibly as a result of the E484K mutation. On the other hand, the wildtype structure showed a slightly more positive distribution (−587.879 to +501.106).
In the qualitative aspect, we noticed that the P.2 strain made the β-sheet formed
between the K417N and N501Y mutations with a shorter length compared to the
structure absent from mutations.

In summary, the RMSF averages of (1.33 ± 0.76)A
lineage compared to the ACE2-RBD wild-type complex. These results reﬂect less entropic penalty and therefore greater susceptibility to seasonal inﬂuences as a result of
the term −T · ΔS in addition to the increase in the interaction aﬃnity and greater
probability of cell entry. In the P.2 lineage we concluded that N501Y mutation showed
a formation of an additional hydrogen bond between RBD:Tyr501 → ACE2: Lys353.
While at the global level, P.2 generated an average of 204 ± 11 while without mutations this number decreased to 201 ± 12. This can therefore be correlated with the
greater transmissibility of this strain, where the ACE2-RBD interaction becomes more
spontaneous. In terms of native contacts Q(t) the P.2 lineage induced a decrease from
0.992 ± 0.002 to 0.988 ± 0.002 indicating a more notable structural change, although
still stable. As for the compaction aspects, the Radius of Gyration (Rg) value de26

creased from (31.63 ± 0.21)A
compaction of the ACE2-RBD complex. In general, the P.2 strain provided stabilization of the ACE2-RBD complex and consequently, a priori, it would not disappear due
to evolutionary pressure since it beneﬁts the virus, and perhaps that is why there is
a convergence of certain mutations such as E484K and N501Y. Finally, we hope with
these results to help in the theoretical understanding of the impacts of the emerging
lineages in Brazil. For this reason, it is essential to update the vaccines as soon as possible in order to minimize the eﬀects of current and future non-synonymous mutations
speciﬁcally on the Spike glycoprotein.
