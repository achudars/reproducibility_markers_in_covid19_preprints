Abstract

23

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (variant Alpha) and B.1.351 (variant Beta) have supplanted pre-existing

24

strains in many countries. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by lung abnormalities, including the

25

presence of syncytial pneumocytes. Syncytia form when infected cells fuse with adjacent cells.

26

The fitness, cytopathic effects and type-I interferon (IFN) sensitivity of the variants remain

27

poorly characterized. Here, we assessed B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 spread and fusion in cell cultures.

28

B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 replicated similarly to D614G reference strain in Vero, Caco-2, Calu-3 and

29

primary airway cells and were similarly sensitive to IFN. The variants formed larger and more

30

numerous syncytia. Variant Spikes, in the absence of any other viral proteins, resulted in faster

31

fusion relative to D614G. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 fusion was similarly inhibited by interferon

32

induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). Individual mutations present in the variant Spikes

33

modified fusogenicity, binding to ACE2 and recognition by monoclonal antibodies. Also, B.1.1.7

34

and B.1.351 variants remain sensitive to innate immunity components. The mutations present

35

in the two variants globally enhance viral fusogenicity and allow for antibody evasion.

Introduction

38

39

SARS-CoV-2 was initially discovered during an outbreak in Wuhan, China, before it

40

became pandemic (Huang et al, 2020). The ancestral Wuhan strain has since been supplanted

41

by variants harboring a variety of adaptive mutations throughout the viral genome. One of the

42

earliest identified variant displayed the D614G mutation in the Spike (S) protein, which

43

increased viral infectivity without significantly altering antibody neutralization (Yurkovetskiy et

44

al, 2020). Several other variants have emerged and become globally dominant, including B.1.1.7

45

(or variant alpha) first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.351 (variant beta) identified in

46

South Africa, P.1 (variant gamma) and P.2 identified in Brazil, and the B.1.617 lineage (including

47

B.1.617.2 or variant delta) identified in India (Buss et al, 2021; Frampton et al, 2021; Planas et

48

al, 2021b; Sabino et al, 2021; Tegally et al, 2020; Yadav et al, 2021). Some of these variants are

49

more transmissible at the population level but their impact on disease severity is debated

50

(Davies et al, 2021; Kemp et al, 2021; Korber et al, 2020). One characteristic of the variants is

51

their ability to evade part of the neutralizing antibody response directed towards the S protein

52

(Liu et al, 2021c; Planas et al, 2021a; Rees-Spear et al, 2021; Starr et al, 2021; Weisblum et al,

53

2020). This protein is important to the early stages of the viral life cycle. Virus-cell fusion occurs

54

through the interaction of trimeric S with the ACE2 receptor and its subsequent cleavage and

55

priming by TMPRSS2 and other cellular proteases (Hoffmann et al, 2020b). The conformational

56

change induced by cleavage at the S1-S2 and S2’ sites, allows for S to extend into the target

57

membrane and trigger fusion (Dimitrov, 2004; Hoffmann et al, 2020a). Mutations in S are of

58

particular concern as they can modify antibody recognition, affinity to ACE2, proteolytic

59

processing and incorporation into virions. It is therefore important to characterize how the

60

mutations of the variants impact replicative fitness and cytopathic effects.

61

Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 infections range from febrile respiratory disorders to severe lung

62

injury characterized by vascular thrombosis and alveolar damage (Bussani et al, 2020). The

63

deterioration of respiratory tissue is likely a result of both virus-induced cytopathicity and

64

indirect immune-mediated damage (Buchrieser et al, 2020; Zhang et al, 2020; Zhou et al, 2020;

65

Zhu et al, 2020). A peculiar dysmorphic cellular feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the presence

66

of large infected multinucleated syncytia, predominately comprised of pneumocytes (Braga et

67

al, 2021; Bussani et al., 2020; Sanders et al, 2021). Other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1,

68

MERS-CoV, and HKU1 also induce fusion in infected patient tissue and primary cell culture

69

systems (Chan et al, 2013; Dominguez et al, 2013; Franks et al, 2003; Qian et al, 2013).

70

Mechanistically, syncytia formation is analogous to virus-cell fusion. The interaction of S

71

present on the plasma membrane of infected cells with receptors and priming proteases on

72

adjacent cells results in cell-cell fusion (Buchrieser et al., 2020). Syncytial cells may compound

73

SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathicity, play a role in viral persistence and dissemination and could

74

potentially be a pathological substrate for respiratory tissue damage (Braga et al., 2021;

75

Buchrieser et al., 2020; Sanders et al., 2021). There is a general paucity of information regarding

76

how the mutations associated with the variant S proteins contribute to cellular pathology.

78

The interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the key factors down-modulating viral

79

entry and replication, and deficiencies in the interferon response are associated with more

80

severe COVID-19 (Arunachalam et al, 2020; Bastard et al, 2021; Bastard et al, 2020; Hadjadj et

81

al, 2020; van der Made et al, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 induced syncytia formation by the Wuhan

82

strain is restricted by innate immunity through the action of interferon induced transmembrane

83

proteins (IFITMs) (Buchrieser et al., 2020). IFITM1, 2 and 3 are restriction factors which display

84

antiviral activity against a variety of enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV-2; likely by

85

increasing membrane rigidity and hindering virus-cell fusion (Shi et al, 2021). Their

86

effectiveness at restricting cell-cell fusion of novel variants has yet to be assessed.

87

Here we compared the replication, IFN sensitivity and syncytia forming potential of

88

D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 viruses in human cell lines and primary airway cells. We further

89

characterize the fusogenicity of variant S proteins and the individual contribution of each of the

90

component mutations in syncytia formation, ACE2 binding and evasion from a panel of

91

antibodies.

Comparative Replication Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Variants

95

We compared the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 variants in relevant cell cultures.

96

We first infected Caco-2, Calu-3 and Vero cells with the B.1.1.7, B.1.35, and D614G variants and

97

generated multistep growth curves (Fig. 1). Cell were infected at an equivalent, non-saturating

98

MOI, initially titrated in Vero cells (Fig. EV1A). Viral replication was assessed at 24, 48, and 72

99

hours by flow cytometry upon staining with the pan-SARS-CoV-2 anti-S mAb102 human

100

monoclonal antibody (Planas et al., 2021a) and then gating for S+ cells (Fig. EV1B). Globally, the

101

variants replicated similarly (Fig. 1). This similar replication was observed at different MOIs (Fig.

102

EV1A). There were subtle differences at 24h post-infection, depending on the cell line and the

103

variant. For instance, B.1.351 replicated slightly more than D614G in Caco-2 cells whereas

104

B.1.1.7 replicated slight less than D614G in Vero cells (Fig. 1A, C). Viral release at each time

105

point was also assessed by extracting RNA from the supernatant and performing RT-qPCR for

106

the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Viral release was again roughly similar with the different variants,

107

especially at early time points. B.1.1.7 produced moderately more virus than D614G in all cell

108

lines at later time points (Fig. 1A-C). B.1.351 produced more virus than D614G in Caco-2 but

109

less in Calu-3 cells at later time points (Fig. 1A, B).

110

As variants did not show any major difference in replication under basal conditions, we

111

next investigated if they were differently sensitive to the interferon response. To this aim, we

112

treated Vero Cells with different doses of IFN- and infected them with the different variants.

113

IFN- was equally effective at reducing viral replication of D614G, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants

114

(Fig. EV1C).

115

We then used the MucilAirBTM model, which consists of primary human airway epithelial

116

cells (HAEC) grown over a porous membrane and differentiated at the air-liquid interface for

117

over 4 weeks. This relevant model is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Pizzorno et al, 2020;

118

Robinot et al, 2020; Touret et al, 2021). The cells were infected with each of the SARS-CoV-2

119

variants at a similar low viral inoculum (104 TCID50). Viral RNA and infectious virus release

120

were monitored over 96h by RT-qPCR and TCID50. B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants produced

121

slightly more extracellular viral RNA than D614G at later time points but not significantly higher

122

levels of infectious particles (Fig. 1D).

123

Taken together our data show that B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants replicate similarly to the

124

ancestral D614G strain in a panel of human cell lines and in primary cells, with some slight

125

differences. The variants are also similarly sensitive to IFN-treatment.

126

127

Syncytia formation in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

128

We next assessed the potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants to induce syncytia. In order to

129

visualize cell-cell fusion, we employed our previously described S-Fuse assay, using U2OS-ACE2

130

GFP-split cells (Buchrieser et al., 2020). In the GFP-split complementation system, two cell lines

131

containing half of the reporter protein are co-cultured, producing a GFP signal only upon fusion

132

(Fig. 2A). Upon infection of S-Fuse cells, we noticed that the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants

133

formed larger and more numerous infected syncytia than either D614G or the ancestral Wuhan

134

strain (Fig. EV2A). We then characterized quantitatively the differences in fusogenicity by

135

calculating the total syncytia (GFP) area and then normalizing it to nuclei number (Hoechst)

136

(Fig. EV2B). Relative to D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants produced significantly more

137

syncytia, approximately 4.5 and 3-fold respectively, after 20h of infection with the same MOI

138

(Fig. 2B and EV3A). In order to characterize syncytia formation in a cell line expressing

139

endogenous ACE2, we generated Vero cells carrying the GFP-split system. After 48h of infection

140

with the same MOI, we again found that B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants produced significantly

141

more syncytia than D614G (Fig. 2C and EV3B) despite similar infection levels (Fig. 1C). Of note,

142

D614G produced similar levels of syncytia as the Wuhan strain in both Vero and S-Fuse cells

143

(Fig. 2 and EV3A-B). Preincubation of S-Fuse cell with IFN-abrogated infection and syncytia

144

formation to the same extent with the different variants (Fig. EV3C).

145
146

Therefore, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants appear more fusogenic than D614G in S-Fuse
and Vero cells.

147

148

Syncytia formation in cells expressing variant Spikes.

149

Since syncytia formation is a consequence of the S protein expressed on the surface of

150

an infected cell interacting with ACE2 receptors on neighboring cell, we sought to compare the

151

fusogenic potential of the individual variant S proteins. We introduced the D614G mutation into

152

the Wuhan protein and designed plasmids to express B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins. We

153

transfected the respective plasmids into Vero GFP-split cells and quantified syncytia formation

154

18h later (Fig. 3A). B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins were 2 and 1.7-fold more fusogenic than

155

D614G S, respectively (Fig. 3B). The Wuhan S was slightly less fusogenic that the D614G S (Fig.

156

3B). We then verified that the variation in S mediated fusion was not due to differential cell

157

surface levels. We transfected 293T cells, which lack ACE2 and thus do not fuse upon S

158

expression, with the different variant plasmids and assessed S surface levels by flow cytometry.

159

The variants S proteins were equally expressed after transfection (Fig. EV4A-B).

160

We then measured the kinetics of syncytia formation induced by the different S proteins

161

in the Vero GFP Split cells. We conducted a comparative video-microscopy analysis where cell-

162

cell fusion could be visualized as soon as 6h post-transfection. The fusion kinetics of B.1.1.7 S

163

protein was more rapid than any of the other variants (Fig. 3C and Movie E1). B.1.351 also

164

induced significantly faster fusion than D614G, whereas the Wuhan S was the slowest of all the

165

compared proteins (Fig. 3C and Movie E1). Thus, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S protein are more potent

166

fusogens than either the D614G or Wuhan strains.

167

We previously reported that IFITMs restrict Wuhan S mediated cell-cell fusion and that

168

their activity was counteracted by the TMPRSS2 protease (Buchrieser et al., 2020). As infection

169

with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 induce more syncytia, we further investigated if this resulted in an

170

increased resistance to IFITM restriction. We thus characterized the impact of IFITMs on

171

syncytia formed by expression of D614G, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins. The variants were

172

effectively restricted by IFITMs (Fig. EV5A-E). The presence of TMPRSS2 increased fusion of all S

173

proteins and reverted the restriction by IFITMs (Fig. EV5A-E). Taken together, our data show

174

that B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants induce more syncytia, but that their S proteins remain

175

similarly sensitive to IFITMs.

178

Contribution of individual variant-associated mutations on Spike fusogenicity.

179

We next sought to determine the contribution of each variant-associated mutation to

180

cell-cell fusion. Both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins contain the N501Y mutation in the RBD and

181

the D614G mutation in the S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 4A). B.1.1.7 S contains the ∆69/70 and

182

∆Y144 deletions in the N-terminal domain (NTD), P681H and T716I mutations in the S1/S2

183

cleavage site, the S982A mutation in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) site and the D1118H mutation

184

in between HR1 and HR2. The B.1.351 S is comprised of the L18F, D80A, D215G and ∆242-244

185

mutations in the NTD, K417N and E484K mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD), and

186

A701V in the S1/S2 cleavage site. We introduced individual mutations into the D614G

187

background. Following reports of the emergence of the E484K mutation within the B.1.1.7

188

variant (Collier et al, 2021), we also generated a mutant B.1.1.7 S protein with the E484K

189

mutation. We observed by flow cytometry that the mutant S proteins were similarly expressed

190

at the cell surface (Fig. EV4 C and EV6 A-D). We expressed each mutant into Vero GFP split and

191

measured their potential to induce cell-cell fusion in comparison to D614G S protein.

192

Of the mutations that are associated with B.1.1.7, we found that the ∆69/70 deletion in

193

the RBD decreased cell-cell fusion whereas P681H and D1118H substitutions both increase

194

fusion (Fig. 4A and EV6G). P681H displayed the greatest fusogenicity of all investigated

195

mutations, being almost 2.5-fold higher than D614G S (Fig. 4A and EV6G). As previously

196

mentioned, the introduction of the D614G mutation in the S1/S2 boarder of the Wuhan S

197

protein also relatively increased fusion, stressing the importance of this cleavage site in

198

determining fusogenicity (Fig. 3B).

199

Among the mutations associated with B.1.351, the ∆242-244 deletion as well as K417N

200

and E484K mutations in the RBD significantly decreased syncytia formation (Fig. 4A and EV6H).

201

Only the D251G mutation in the NTD modestly increased syncytia formation relative to D614G

202

(Fig. 4A and EV6H). The introduction of the E484K RBD mutation into the B.1.1.7 S protein

203

significantly decreased its potential to form syncytia, despite not changing cell surface

204

expression, further supporting the mutation’s restrictive effect on cell-cell fusion (Fig. 4B and

205

EV4C). Taken together, our data suggests that the variant S proteins are comprised of

206

mutations that play contrasting roles in cell-cell fusion. P681H, D1118H, and D215G

207

substitutions facilitate fusion, whereas mutations ∆69/70, ∆242-244, K417N, and E484K

208

antagonize cell-cell fusion.

209

210

Binding of Spike proteins bearing individual variant-associated mutations to ACE2.

211

We next explored the impact of variant-associated mutations on S binding to the ACE2

212

receptor. To this aim, we transiently expressed each mutant protein in 293T cells. Cells were

213

then stained with a serial dilution of soluble biotinylated ACE2, revealed with fluorescent

214

streptavidin and then analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5A). Titration binding curves were

215

generated and EC50 (the amount of ACE2 needed for 50% binding) was calculated. The S

216

protein of B.1.1.7 had the highest affinity to ACE2, confirming previous results by us and others

217

(Planas et al., 2021)(Ramanathan et al, 2021). B.1.1.7 was sequentially followed by B.1.351,

218

D614G, and Wuhan S (Fig. 5B and EV7A). As expected, mutations within the RBD had the most

219

significant impact on ACE2 binding. N501Y found in both B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 drastically

220

increased ACE2 binding, in line with previous reports indicating that this mutation enhances

221

affinity of the viral protein to its receptor (Ali et al, 2021; Luan et al, 2021; Tian et al, 2021). The

222

K417N substitution present in the B.1.351 S decreased ACE2 binding (Fig. 5B and EV7C). The

223

E484K mutant had a slightly, but not significantly, higher binding to ACE2 (Fig. EV7C). This was

224

corroborated by the observation that addition of the E484K mutation to B.1.1.7 S protein also

225

slightly increased ACE2 binding (Fig. 5B and EV7A). Mutation in the S1/S2 cleavage site,

226

HR1/HR2 sites or NTD did not have any significant impact on ACE2 binding (Fig. 5B and EV7B-E).

227

It is worth noting that the NTD ∆242-244 mutant displayed a marginally lower binding to ACE2

228

(Fig. 5B and EV7B). Therefore, the N501Y mutation is the single most significant contributor to

229

increased ACE2 binding of the variants, though it does not affect cell-cell fusion on its own. The

230

K417N, ∆242-244, and E484K mutations restrict fusogenicity but differently effect ACE2

231

binding; with the former two decreasing affinity and the latter slightly increasing.

232
233

Therefore, ACE2 binding and fusogenicity are two functions of the S protein that can be
partially deconvoluted through individual mutations.

234

235

Antibody binding to Spike proteins bearing individual variant-associated mutations.

236

We then investigated if variant associated mutations that modulate fusogenicity arose

237

in the context of antibody escape. To this aim, we assessed by flow cytometry the binding of a

238

panel of four human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the different S mutants. As a control we

239

within the S2 region (Planchais, manuscript in preparation). mAb10 equally recognized all

241

variants and associated individual mutations (Fig. 5C). mAb48 and mAb98 target the RBD and

242

mAb71 the NTD (Planchais, manuscript in preparation). mAb48 did not recognize the B.1.351

243

variant, and more specifically did not bind to the K417N mutant (Fig. 5C). The mAb71

244

recognized neither B.1.1.7 nor B.1.351 variants and did not bind to their respective NTD ∆Y144

245

and ∆242-244 mutations. The K417N and ∆242-244 mutations were also responsible for

246

decreasing S-mediated fusion, suggesting a tradeoff between antibody escape and fusion (Fig.

247

5C). mAb98 did not recognize the B.1.351 variant. However, none of the associated mutations

248

were specifically responsible for the lack of binding (Fig. 5C), suggesting a combined effect on

249

the structure of the S protein that may affect antibody escape.

Discussion

252

The replication and cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants is under intense scrutiny,

253

with contrasting results in the literature (Frampton et al., 2021; Hou et al, 2020; Leung et al,

254

2021; Liu et al, 2021b; Touret et al., 2021). For instance, there was no major difference in the

255

replication kinetics of B.1.1.7 and D614G strains in some reports (Thorne et al, 2021; Touret et

256

al., 2021), whereas others suggested that B.1.1.7 may outcompete D614G in a co-infection

257

assay (Touret et al., 2021). Other studies proposed that the N501Y mutation may provide a

258

replication advantage, whereas others suggested that N501Y is deleterious (Frampton et al.,

259

2021; Hou et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b). These discrepant results may be

260

due to the use of different experimental systems, viral strains, multiplicities of infection and cell

261

types.

262

Here, we show that variants replicate to the same extent as the early D614G strain in

263

different human cell lines and primary airway cells. Moreover, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 induced

264

more cell-cell fusion than D614G. Increased fusion was observed in U2OS-ACE2 cells and in

265

naturally permissive Vero cells. In agreement with infection data, transfection of B.1.1.7 and

266

B.1.351 S proteins, in the absence of any other viral factors, produced significantly more

267

syncytia than D614G, which in turn, fused more than the Wuhan S. Comparative video

268

microscopy analysis revealed that the B.1.1.7 S fused the most rapidly, which was then followed

269

by B.1.351, D614G, and finally Wuhan. Thus, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants display enhanced S-

270

mediated syncytia formation.

271

We further show that B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 remain sensitive to restriction by IFN-β1. The

272

fusion mediated by their respective S proteins is inhibited by IFITMs. This extend previous

273

results by us and others demonstrating that ancestral Wuhan S is effectively inhibited by this

274

family of restriction factors (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2021). It has been recently

275

reported that B.1.1.7 may lead to lower levels of IFN-β1 production by infected Calu-3 cells and

276

may be less sensitive to IFN-β pre-treatment, when compared to first wave viral isolates

277

(Thorne et al., 2021). We did not detect here differences of IFN-β1 sensitivity between the

278

variants in Vero and U2OS-ACE2 cells. Again, these discrepant results may reflect inherent

279

differences between Calu-3, Vero and U2OS-ACE2 cells, or the use of different viral isolates.

280

We then characterized the contribution of the individual mutations present in the

281

B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 S proteins to their respective fusogenicity. The highly fusogenic B.1.1.7 S

282

consists of more mutations that robustly increase fusion (P681H and D1118H) than mutations

283

that decrease fusion (∆69/70). In contrast, the B.1.351 variant is comprised of several restrictive

284

mutations (∆242-244, K417N, and E484K) and only one mutation that modestly increased

285

fusion (D215G). The strongest increase in fusion was elicited by the P681H mutation at the

286

S1/S2 border. This mutation likely facilitates proteolytic cleavage of S and thus promotes S

287

mediate cell-cell fusion. Indeed, the analogous P681R mutation present in B.1.617.2 and

288

B.1.617.3 variants increases S1/S2 cleavage and facilitates syncytia formation (Ferreira et al,

289

2021; Jiang et al, 2020). Of note, another report with indirect assessment of variant S

290

fusogenicity suggested a mild decrease or no difference in cell-cell fusion of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351

291

relative to Wuhan S (Hoffmann et al, 2021). These previous experiments were performed in

292

293T cells at a late time-points (24 hours post-transfection), which may preclude detection of

293

an accelerated fusion triggered by the variants.

294

We show that the binding of variant S to soluble ACE2 paralleled their fusogenicity.

295

B.1.1.7 bound the most efficiently to ACE2, followed by B.1.351, D614G and finally Wuhan.

296

However, the ACE2 affinity of S proteins carrying individual mutations did not exactly correlate

297

to fusogenicity. For instance, the N501Y and D614G mutations drastically increased ACE2

298

affinity, but only D614G enhanced fusogenicity. The K417N substitution, and to a lesser degree

299

∆242-244, had a lower affinity to ACE2 and also restricted cell-cell fusion. The E484K mutation

300

significantly restricts fusion, but mildly increases ACE2 affinity. This suggests that on the level of

16

301

individual S mutations, the relationship between ACE2 affinity and increased fusogenicity is not

302

always linear.

303

We selected a panel of 4 mAbs that displayed different profiles of binding to B.1.1.7,

304

B.1.351, D614G and Wuhan S proteins. The mAb10 targeting the S2 domain recognized all

305

variants and was used as a positive control. Wuhan and D614G were recognized by the three

306

other antibodies, targeting either the NTD or RBD. B.1.1.7 lost recognition by the anti-NTD

307

mAb71, whereas B.1.351 was neither recognized by mab71 nor by the two anti-RBD antibodies

308

mAb48 and mAb 98. Upon examining the potential of S proteins carrying individual mutations

309

to bind to human monoclonal antibodies, we found that the ones that restrict (∆242-244,

310

K417N) or have no effect on fusogenicity (∆Y144) are also not recognized by some mAbs. This

311

suggests that variant S proteins have undergone evolutionary trade off in some circumstances;

312

selecting for mutations that provide antibody escape at the detriment of fusogenicity. In

313

accordance with our findings, deep sequence binding analysis and in vitro evolution studies

314

suggest the N501Y mutation increases affinity to ACE2 without disturbing antibody

315

neutralization (Liu et al, 2021a; Starr et al., 2021; Zahradník et al, 2021). The E484K and K417N

316

RBD mutations in the B.1.351 variant may also increase ACE2 affinity, particularly when in

317

conjunction with N501Y (Zahradník et al., 2021) (Nelson et al, 2021). However, the resulting

318

conformational change of the S protein RBD may also decrease sensitivity to neutralizing

319

antibodies (Nelson et al., 2021). Future work assessing the structural and conformational

320

changes in the S protein elicited by a combination of individual mutations or deletions may

321

further help elucidate the increased fusogenicity and antibody escape potential of the variants.

322

The presence of infected syncytial pneumocytes was documented in the lungs of

323

patients with severe COVID-19 (Bussani et al., 2020; Tian et al, 2020; Xu et al, 2020). Syncytia

324

formation may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread, immune evasion and tissue

325

damage. A report using reconstituted bronchial epithelia found that viral infection results in the

326

formation and release of infected syncytia that contribute to the infectious dose (Beucher et al,

327

2021). The neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has divergent effect on cell-

328

cell fusion, with some antibodies restricting S mediated fusion, while other increase syncytia

329

formation (Asarnow et al, 2021). Cell-to-cell spread of virus may be less sensitive to

330

neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma than cell-free virus (Jackson

331

et al, 2021). It is thus possible that infected syncytial cells facilitate viral spread. Heterocellular

332

syncytia containing internalized lymphocytes have also been detected in infected lung tissue

333

(Zhang et al, 2021). The targeting of lymphocytes for cell-in-cell mediated death suggest that

334

syncytia may contribute to immune escape (Zhang et al., 2021). Within this context, it is

335

necessary to better understand the fusogenic potential of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that have

336

arisen and will continue to emerge.

337

We have characterized here the replication, fusogenicity, ACE2 binding and antibody

338

recognition of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants and the role of their S-associated mutations. Despite

339

the insights we provide into the S-mediated fusogenicity of the variants, we did not address the

340

conformational changes that the mutations individually or in combination may elicit. We show

341

that B.1.1.7 more efficiently binds to ACE2 and is more fusogenic than B.1.351. Whether these

342

two features of B.1.1.7 explain its higher transmissibility rate than B.1.351 will deserve further

was ordered as a synthetic gene (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and was cloned into a

353

phCMV backbone (GeneBank: AJ318514), by replacing the VSV-G gene. The mutations for

354

B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 (Fig. 4A) were added in silico to the codon-optimized Wuhan strain and

355

ordered as synthetic genes (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cloned into the same

356

backbone (Planas et al., 2021a). The D614G S-protein was generated by introducing the

mutation into the Wuhan reference strain via Q5 Site-directed mutagenesis (NEB). Other

358

individual mutations were subsequently introduced into the D614G S by the same process.

GFP-Split Fusion assay

403

For cell-cell fusion assays, Vero, U20S-ACE2, or 293T cell lines stably expressing GFP1-10 and

404

GFP11 were co-cultured at a 1:1 ration (3x104 , 7x104 , and 2x104 cells/well total, respectively)

405

were transfected in suspension with a total of 100ng of DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo)

406

in a 96 well plate (uClear, #655090). 10 ng of phCMV-SARS-CoV2-S and/or 25 ng of pCDNA3.1-

407

hACE2, 25 ng of pCSDest-TMPRSS2, and 40 ng of pQCXIP-IFITM were used and adjusted to 100

408

ng DNA with pQCXIP-Empty. At 20 h post-transfection images covering 80-90% of the well

409

surface, were acquired per well on an Opera Phenix High-Content Screening System

410

(PerkinElmer). The GFP area and the number of nuclei was quantified on Harmony High-

411

Content Imaging and Analysis Software (Fig EV2B). For infection, cells were plated at the

412

aforementioned concentrations and infected the next day with a range of MOIs and fixed at

413

20h (U2OS-ACE) or 48h (Vero) post-infection with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30mins. For video

414

microscopy experiments, Vero GFP split cells (mixed 1:1) were transfected in suspension with

415

50ng of phCMV-SARS-CoV2-S and 450ng of pQCXIP-Empty for 30mins at 37°C. Cells were

416

washed twice and then seeded at a confluency of 2x105 cells per quadrant in a u-Dish 35mm

417

Quad dish (ibidi-#80416). Cells were allowed to settle, and fluorescence images were taken at

418

37°C every 10min up to 24h using a Nikon BioStation IMQ, with three fields for each condition.

422

For ACE2 binding, 293T cells transfected with S proteins for 24h were stained with soluble

423

biotinylated ACE2 diluted in MACS Buffer at indicated concentrations (from 60 to 0.01 µg/mL)

424

for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and then incubated with Alexa

425

Fluor 647- conjugated-streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:400) for 30 min at 4°C. Finally,

426

the cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The results

427

were acquired using an Attune Nxt Flow Cytometer (Life Technologies). Transfection efficiency

428

was assessed by staining with pan-SARS-CoV-2 human mAb129. Antibody binding to S proteins

429

was assessed via s analogous protocol where transfected 293T cells were first stained with

430

either human mAb10 (pan-coronavirus anti-S2), mAb102 and mAB129 (pan-SARS-CoV-2),

431

mAb48 and mAb98 (SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD), and mAb71 (SARS-CoV-2 anti-NTD) at 1 µg/mL. For

432

viral replication, infected cells were fixed at each time with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30mins.

433

The cells were stained in the same manner described above with anti-spike mAb102 and

434

secondary Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500) in MACS buffer containing 0.05% saponin. The gating
