Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 540,000 deaths globally. Hyperinflammation mediated
by dysregulated monocyte/macrophage function is considered to be the key factor that triggers severe illness in
COVID-19. However, no specific targeting molecule has been identified for detecting or treating
hyperinflammation related to dysregulated macrophages in severe COVID-19. Herein, we suggest candidate
targets for imaging and therapy in severe COVID-19 by analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data based on
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of COVID-19 patients. We found that expression of SLC2A3, which can be imaged
by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose, was higher in macrophages from severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, by
integrating the surface target database and drug-target binding database with RNA-sequencing data of severe
COVID-19, we identified CCR1 and FPR1 as surface and druggable targets for drug delivery as well as molecular
imaging. Our results provide a resource for candidate targets in the development of specific imaging and therapy
for COVID-19-related hyperinflammation.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to over 540,000 deaths worldwide as of July 9, 2020 (1)
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). The Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed the
characteristics of 72,314 cases of COVID-19 and reported that disease severity varies widely, with 81% of patients
experiencing mild disease, 14% developing severe disease, and 5% developing critical disease that is characterized
by respiratory and/or multiorgan failure (2, 3). In most cases, severe/critical disease develops within 2 weeks after
symptom onset (4), and in a recent study, it was reported that the mortality of patients undergoing mechanical
ventilation was 88.1% (4, 5). Therefore, efforts to identify and manage patients who are at high risk of developing
severe illness are urgently needed.
Hyperinflammation mediated by dysregulated macrophage and monocyte responses is considered to be
the key factor causing severe disease in patients with severe COVID-19 based on observations of prevalent
lymphocytopenia and massive infiltration of macrophages in multiple organs, including the lungs, spleen, lymph
nodes, heart and kidney (3, 6). Recently, targeted probes based on small molecules and antibodies have contributed
to precise diagnosis and treatment in various inflammatory and infectious diseases (7, 8). Nonetheless, which
molecular targets might be utilized in imaging and drug delivery for hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 has
not been investigated. Molecular imaging to detect characteristic hyperinflammation by a dysregulated immune
response has the potential to predict the progression of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, a drug delivery system
to target specific immune cells that cause hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 might allow precise immune
modulation and greatly impact patient survival.
In this study, we analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data based on bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) fluid cells of healthy controls and COVID-19 patients along with three different databases, the
Surfaceome database (9), the Database of Imaging Radiolabeled Compounds (DIRAC) (10), and BindingDB (11),
to identify feasible targets for molecular imaging and therapy in severe COVID-19.

Results
Composition of immune cells in BAL fluid
scRNA-seq data of BAL fluid cells were obtained from three patients with moderate COVID-19, six
patients with severe/critical COVID-19, and four healthy controls (Gene Expression Omnibus database, accession
number GSE145926) (12). BAL fluid cells were classified into 21 clusters according to expression of cell-type
specific marker genes (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 1). We explored the cell subpopulation of each group and
identified a substantial difference in the composition of immune cells between the three groups (Fig. 1B). The
majority of cells in BAL fluid were composed of different types of macrophages in the three groups. T-cells were
more abundant in the moderate COVID-19 group than in the severe COVID-19 group. In contrast, neutrophils,
natural killer (NK) T-cells, and plasma cells were more abundant in the severe COVID-19 group than in the
moderate COVID-19 group. The composition of macrophage subpopulations differed between the three groups:
1) in the healthy control group, a cluster of macrophages, M02, was the most abundant subpopulation; 2) in
moderate COVID-19, M04 was the most abundant cluster; and 3) in severe COVID-19, M01 and M03 were the
two most dominant cell types.
We utilized the following two different approaches to discover potential targets to image and/or
modulate the dysregulated immune system in severe COVID-19: 1) evaluating the expression levels of alleged
imaging targets for inflammation and 2) exploring markers filtered by targetable molecules based on publicly
available databases (Fig. 1C).

Evaluating expression levels of alleged imaging targets
We evaluated the expression levels of the molecular targets of clinically available imaging tracers for
inflammation in BAL fluid cells of COVID-19. First, we selected molecular targets and matched imaging tracers
among metabolism-related tracers: glucose transporters (GLUT)/2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]FDG)
(13), monocarboxylate transporters (MCT)/[11C]-acetate (14), folate receptors (FOLR)/[18F]-labeled folic acid
derivatives (15), and L-type amino acid transporter 1/[11C]-methionine (16). Furthermore, target molecules for
macrophage imaging and matched imaging tracers were selected: translocator protein (TSPO)/[11C]-PBR28 (17)
and mannose receptor 1 (MRC1)/2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-mannose (18). The expression levels of other imaging
target molecules were also examined: somatostatin receptor subtype-2 (SSTR2)/[68Ga]-DOTA-TATE (19),
fibroblast-activated protein (FAP)/[68Ga]-fibroblast-associated protein inhibitor (20) considering pulmonary
fibrosis of COVID-19 (21), alpha-v-beta-3 integrin (ITGAV)/arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD) (22), CD8+ T-

cells/[89Zr]-radiolabeled human CD8-specific minibody (23), and granzyme B (GZMB)/[68Ga]-NOTA-GZP (24).
All selected molecular targets were projected onto a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
plot depicting 21 immune cell clusters of all patients, and macrophages enriched in severe COVID-19 patients
were marked separately (Fig. 2A). The expression levels of molecular targets were scattered separately for cells
from healthy controls, moderate COVID-19, and severe COVID-19 for each immune cell cluster. SLC2A1
(GLUT1) showed low expression across the immune cell clusters, whereas SLC16A3 (MCT4) was highly
expressed in macrophage clusters. To analyze whether molecular targets are able to distinguish the severity of
COVID-19 infection, we compared the expression level of each target between the groups (Fig. 2B,
Supplementary Fig. 2). We found that SLC2A3 (GLUT3) was increased in macrophage clusters enriched in severe
COVID-19 patients. TSPO and MRC1 were highly expressed in macrophage clusters enriched in healthy controls
and moderate COVID-19 patients. GZMB was highly expressed in CD8+ T-cells and NK T-cells of the severe
COVID-19 group. As we found that GLUT3 was associated with M01 and M03 clusters, two dominant
macrophage subtypes in severe COVID-19, we further analyzed enrichment scores for glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathways to explore the characteristics of glucose utilization in severe COVID-19
(Fig. 2C). Interestingly, in most immune cells, including T-cells and macrophages, enrichment scores of glycolysis
were higher in the severe COVID-19 group than in the moderate and healthy control groups. In neutrophil and
macrophage clusters, scores of OXPHOS were lower in the severe group than in the moderate and healthy control
groups. As [18F]FDG uptake is determined by expression levels of GLUTs and hexokinase, the initial enzyme of
glycolysis, we assume that [18F]FDG positron emission tomography (PET) can be used for the detection of severe
COVID-19.

Exploration of ideal targets of severe COVID-19 hyperinflammation
We hypothesized that an ideal target for imaging and targeted therapy of COVID-19 would have the
following characteristics: 1) highly expressed in severe COVID-19, 2) expressed on the cell surface, and 3) the
existence of binding molecules. Thus, we analyzed scRNA-seq data of COVID-19 BAL fluid cells along with
three different databases: the Surfaceome database (9), the Database of Imaging Radiolabeled Compounds
(DIRAC) (10), and BindingDB (11). The Surfaceome database was constructed using publicly available data on

DIRAC is an open-access PET radiotracer database that provides [18F]-radiolabeled compounds with associated
specific molecules (http://www.iphc.cnrs.fr/dirac/). BindingDB is a database of drug targets with small molecules
binding to specific proteins (https://www.bindingdb.org/).
Based on the proportions of immune cells within each group (Fig. 1B), we considered M01/M03, M04,
and M02 as specific macrophage subtypes for the severe COVID-19, moderate COVID-19, and healthy control
groups, respectively. Venn diagrams were used to display the numbers of marker genes enriched in the specific
macrophage subtypes, surface protein-encoding mRNA from the Surfaceome database, and target proteins from
the PET radiotracer database (Fig. 3A). Targetable marker proteins of the M01, M02, M03, and M04 clusters were
explored, and we identified specific targetable proteins included in both the Surfaceome and PET tracer databases.
As a result, SLC3A2 and SLC2A3 in the M01 cluster and FOLR2 in the M03 cluster were identified, indicating
that [18F]FDG and [18F]-labeled folic acid derivatives may be useful for imaging severe COVID-19 (Fig. 3A).
Additionally, the top 10 surface markers of M01, M02, M03, and M04 selected by fold-changes were
visualized by the average expression level and proportions of protein-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). Notably, a few
surface molecules enriched in M01/M03 among the top 10 surface markers correspond to drug targets in the
BindingDB, including CCR1, FPR1, and GPR183. FPR1 was higher in the severe COVID-19 group than in the
healthy control and moderate groups (Fig. 3C). The specific peptide ligand of FPR1, cinnamoyl-F-(D)L-F-(D)LF (cFLFLF), has been used for imaging inflammation (25) and targeted drug delivery conjugated with
nanoparticles (26) (Fig. 3C). Thus, we suggest that cFLFLF-based imaging or drug delivery systems can be
utilized for imaging and therapy of severe COVID-19. Additionally, there are 1155 and 22 ligand candidates for
CCR1 and GPR183, surface targets enriched in severe COVID-19, in BindingDB, respectively. All markers of
M01, M02, M03, and M04 with surface targets, PET database and targeting drug candidates are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1. Accordingly, for M01/M03 subtypes, 154 surface target candidates, nine [ 18F]-labeled
radiotracers, and 132 molecules associated with drug targets were identified, warranting further evaluation for
utilization in imaging and therapy of severe COVID-19.

Discussion
COVID-19 is a novel viral infection disease of which the most representative manifestation is severe
pulmonary inflammation (4). An excessive inflammatory process is known as a main factor that leads to
pulmonary destruction and even death (27). Many approaches to treating patients with severe COVID-19 by
controlling the immune response using immunomodulators such as dexamethasone, interleukin-6 inhibitors or
tumor necrosis factor blockers have been reported (28, 29). Currently, COVID-19 patients can be classified into
mild, moderate, severe/critical diseases based on clinical symptoms according to the National Health Commission
of China guidelines (30), and the classification of disease severity in COVID-19 is critical for the grading
treatment of patients. Indeed, evaluation of the severity of the immune response is needed to select patients who
urgently need anti-inflammatory treatment if the immune modulation strategy becomes an important treatment
option for severe COVID-19. Moreover, it might be useful in optimizing the allocation of medical resources and
preventing the occurrence of overtreatment and undertreatment in the outbreak of an epidemic. However, to the
best of our knowledge, efficient indicators for the severity of COVID-19, therapeutic response, and outcome have
not been fully elucidated. Some previous studies have proposed clinical symptoms, laboratory, and radiologic
findings as diagnostic tools for the classification of COVID-19 severity (31). Our study suggests targetable
molecules reflecting the different compositions of immune cells according to the severity of COVID-19, indicating
that imaging and therapeutic targeting of specific molecules of hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 may
provide a new feasible strategy of stratification and precision immune modulation in COVID-19.
We explored expression of alleged imaging targets to assess the feasibility of existing molecular imaging
probes for inflammation. Notably, SLC2A3 (GLUT3) was highly expressed in macrophages enriched in severe
COVID-19 patients. In addition, these macrophages showed enhanced glycolysis and relatively low OXPHOS.
These findings support the evaluation of glucose metabolism in inflammatory lesions and can provide information
on the immunologic response associated with severe COVID-19. Notably, by reflecting enhanced glucose
metabolism in inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages, [18F]FDG PET has been commonly employed in
clinical settings for identifying inflammatory or infection foci and evaluating the severity of inflammation (32).
A recent case series also showed increased FDG uptake in COVID-19-related inflammation in the lungs and lymph
nodes (33). Our results suggest that [18F]FDG PET can be utilized to stratify COVID-19 patients with severe
pulmonary inflammation, as enhanced glucose uptake and glycolysis were found to be associated with subtypes
of macrophages in severe COVID-19 compared with moderate disease. Imaging-based characterization has
advantages in reflecting the metabolic aspects of macrophages related to severe COVID-19 and evaluating the

whole body to localize hyperinflammation. In addition to the pulmonary system, other organs, such as the liver or
kidney, can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 (3). Considering the availability of [18F]FDG PET imaging and that can
cover the whole body, it can be used for the diagnosis of systemic inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2. Although
further clinical validation is required, the degree of FDG uptake in inflammatory lesions in the lung can be used
as a predictable finding of hyperinflammation by suggesting macrophage subtypes with enhanced glucose
metabolism.
We further explored candidate molecules for imaging and druggable targets using databases. It is notable
that SLC2A3 (GLUT3) was selected in this analysis, and this result indicates that it is a good candidate for targeted
imaging reflecting immune cells in severe COVID-19 patients. Other surface molecules associated with druggable
targets were also identified; FOLR2 was another candidate imaging target for the severe COVID-19 group. The
folate receptor is a molecular target used to diagnose inflammatory diseases (34). This result is consistent with a
previous animal study that showed the possibility of imaging FOLR2-positive macrophages in acute lung
inflammation (35). In addition, we focused on surface targets that bind to druggable molecules. CCR1 and FPR1
were highly expressed in macrophages enriched in the severe COVID-19 group. Specific druggable molecules for
these targets are indicated in BindingDB. In particular, FPR1 is a G protein-coupled receptor expressed in
macrophages. There is a previous study reporting the feasibility of FPR1 targeted imaging to diagnose macrophage
infiltration in inflammatory diseases (36). As FPR1 is targeted by small peptides (cFLFLF), it can be applied to
active targeting drug delivery systems as well as molecular imaging (26). Furthermore, FPR1 is reported to have
a role in regulating or modulating the immune response in cancer and inflammation (37). As immunomodulation
or immunoregulation has recently been emphasized as a treatment strategy in COVID-19 (38), FPR1 may be an
appropriate target not only for assessing disease severity but also for delivering therapeutic drugs. We identified
various druggable molecules specifically binding to markers of macrophages enriched in severe COVID-19
(Supplementary Table), and the findings may be used to develop an appropriate drug delivery and imaging
platform for precise immune modulation strategies in COVID-19. In other words, the present results indicate that
the target molecules explored can be applied to diagnose severe pulmonary inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2
shortly.
There is a limitation in the present study. Because we analyzed cells from BAL fluid, the results may
not be entirely consistent with the immune cell composition or protein expression of the lung tissue itself.
Nonetheless, the characteristics or composition of cells in BAL fluid reflect immune cells of the lung associated
with inflammation. Thus, targeted imaging of the identified molecules can be applied to in vivo settings. Further

study is warranted to validate the feasibility of targeted theranostics of these molecules.
Taken together, we demonstrate different compositions of immune cells in BAL fluid from healthy
controls and COVID-19 patients. The subpopulations of macrophages differed among the three groups. Regarding
alleged imaging markers, SLC2A3 was abundant in macrophage subtypes enriched in severe COVID-19 patients,
and we identified SLC3A2, SLC2A3, and FOLR2 as candidate molecules as imaging targets. In addition, various
molecular targets, including CCR1, FPR1, and GPR183, are suggested as candidates for drug delivery systems as
well as imaging. This work provides a resource to develop targeted imaging and therapeutic strategies for severe
pulmonary hyperinflammation related to COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Preprocessing scRNA-seq data
scRNA-seq data for BAL fluid were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(GSE145926). The scRNA-seq data were scaled by log-normalization after the read counts were divided by the
total number of transcripts and multiplied by 10,000. Highly variable 2,000 genes were selected using the
FindVariableFeatures function of the Seurat package (version 3.0) (39). Data were then scaled to z-scores with
regression of total cellular read counts and mitochondrial read counts. Cell types were determined by the graphbased clustering approach implemented by the FindClusters function of the Seurat package. Before clustering,
dimension reduction was performed by principal component analysis, and 50 dimensions were used for clustering.
The conservative resolution was set to 0.5.

Clustering cells into each immune cell type
The FindAllMarkers function of the Seurat package was used to identify marker genes of the clusters,
and high-ranked marker genes according to the fold-change were identified for each cluster. For data visualization,
the scRNA-seq data were embedded into two-dimensional projection, t-stochastic neighborhood embedding (tSNE). The expression levels of known marker genes, CD68, FCGR3B, CD1C, LILRA4, KLRD1, CD3D, CD8A,
MS4A1, IGHG4, and TPPP3 (Supplementary Figure 1), were assessed to identify cell types, and each cluster was
classified into eight cell types based on the expression level: T-cell, B-cell, plasma cell, NK T-cell, endothelial
cell, neutrophil, dendritic cell, and macrophage.

Differentially expressed genes and gene set enrichment analyses
To identify marker genes, differential expression analysis was performed using the function
FindAllMarkers of the Seurat package with the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Differentially expressed genes that were
expressed in at least 10% of cells within the cluster and with a fold change greater than 0.25 (log scale) were
considered marker genes. t-SNE plots and violin plots were generated using Seurat. We used Reactome to select
genes of glycolysis and OXPHOS pathways to examine the overall activity of glycolysis and OXPHOS pathways
(40). The metabolic enrichment scores of each cell were estimated by the AddModuleScore function of the curated
gene sets of both pathways to define the metabolic profiles of each sample. Expression of marker genes and
enrichment scores of metabolic pathways were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. For each cluster of cells,
feature scores of severe, moderate COVID-19 and healthy controls were compared.

Exploration of target molecules in open access databases
We used three different databases to discover candidate target molecules: the Surfaceome database (9),
the Database of Imaging Radiolabeled Compounds (DIRAC) (10), and BindingDB (11). Marker genes included
in the three databases were selected. Surface molecules were curated by a database downloaded from the in silico
human surfaceome website (https://wlab.ethz.ch/surfaceome/). Among markers of each cell cluster, surface
markers were selected by Surfaceome, and the top 10 surface targets according to the fold change were selected.
The surface markers between different clusters were then compared. The DIRAC database curates [18F]radiolabeled tracers and their associated molecular targets. All available image-able targets were selected and
compared with markers discovered by scRNA-seq. We also used BindingDB, which provides available druggable
molecules with target proteins. All statistical analyses were performed using the R program (v 3.6.1).
