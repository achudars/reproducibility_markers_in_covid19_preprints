Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in more than 167 million confirmed cases and over 3
million deaths so far1-4. This global pandemic has led to great efforts directed toward the study of this
virus and its infection mechanism as well as development of effective means to control this
devastating infectious disease5-8. Like many other viral surface proteins, the trimeric SARS-CoV-2
spike (S) protein is heavily glycosylated with 22 N- and 2 O-glycosites per monomer which are likely
to influence S protein folding and evade host immune response9. More than one million S protein
sequences with over 1,000 sites of mutation in its 1,273 amino acids have been reported to the
GISAID database, including the highly transmissible variant strains found in the UK and South
Africa10. This high frequency of transmission and mutation is a major challenge in the development
of broadly protective vaccines to control the pandemic. We have studied the impact of glycosylation
on receptor-ligand interaction through evaluation of ACE2 and S protein expressed in different cell
lines. Of different S protein glycoforms, the one expressed from lung epithelial cells, the primary
cells for infection, has more complex-type glycans and higher binding avidity to the receptor as
compared with the S protein from HEK293T cells which have more high-mannose or hybrid-type
glycoforms. We also found that most of the S protein glycosites are highly conserved and the
glycosites at positions 801 and 1194 are essential for viral entry. In addition, the RBD of S1 and the
HR regions of S2 contain most of highly conserved sequences, and removal of each glycosite on
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus for evaluation of the impact on structure and function provides
insights into the design of broadly protective vaccines. In an effort to develop such universal vaccines,
we found that mice immunized with monoglycosylated S protein (Smg) elicited better antibody
responses capable of neutralizing not only the wild type but also the variants from the UK and South
Africa than those with the fully-glycosylated S protein (Sfg), and strikingly, Smg vaccination provides
better survival for hACE2 transgenic mice when challenged with lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2.
Moreover, using single B cell technology, we isolated a monoclonal antibody from Smg immunized
mice which was also able to neutralize the wild type and variants, suggesting that removal of
unnecessary glycans from S protein to better expose the highly conserved sequences is an effective
approach to developing broadly protective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and variants.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a trimeric class I membrane fusion glycoprotein, composed of two
functional subunits, S1 and S2, which are responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion,
respectively11 (Fig. 1a). Each S protein monomer contains 22 N-linked glycosylation sites and at least
two O-linked glycosylation sites, which are important for proper folding and modulation of host
protease processing12,13, and for evading immune response by shielding specific epitopes from
antibody neutralization9. The glycan profile at all 22 N-glycosites on the S protein has been identified,
with 14 sites harboring predominantly the complex-type or hybrid-type glycans while the other 8 sites
mainly the high-mannose type13. Among them, 52% of the glycans contain the fucose residue and
15% bear the sialic acid13. A consistent profile reported later indicated that the three C-terminal sites
with mainly complex-type glycans (N1158, N1173, and N1194) are often further processed into
multiple antennae through GlcNAcylation/galactosylation and/or sialylation compared to the other
sites14, while their specific functions are unknown14. It was shown that a trimeric, complex-type
glycosylated S protein is more efficient in receptor recognition and viral entry than the immaturely
high-mannsose variants derived either from GnTI-/- HEK29315,16 or insect cell17,18. We also found that
the S protein with sialylated complex-type glycans has higher avidity to the receptor than that with
high mannose- or hybrid-type or mono-glycan, and removal of the sialic acid from the complex type
would reduce the binding significantly (Extended Data Fig. 1). However, the role of each glycosite
in the virus life cycle still needs to be elucidated, which raises another critical question as whether
the S protein glycosylation in human lung epithelial cells is different from that in HEK293 cells which
have been widely used13,14, and how this difference may contribute to our understanding of viral
structure and function as well as antigen presentation and vaccine design.

Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants containing single glycosite mutation
To understand the differential influence of each glycosite of S protein on the infection and
replication of SARS-CoV-2, we established a working system by generating a full panel of 24
lentivirus-based pseudotyped virus variants (22 N- and 2 O-glycosites) for comparing the viral entry
efficiency in five different cell lines. To quantitate the pseudotyped virus infection efficiency, we
employed Quantikine® HIV-1 Gag p24 Immunoassay to determine the titer of HIV-1-based lentiviral
supernatant by measuring the color intensity which corresponds to the level of p24, an essential capsid
protein of HIV-1, and plotting it into a p24 standard curve. We first compared the titer of viruses
containing either the wild type S or nine mutants, each with different truncation at the cytoplasmic
tail, and found that the C-terminal 19 aa deletion construct produced the highest titer than others
assayed (Extended Data Fig. 2). Based on this C-terminal truncated construct, we mutated every Nglycosite Asn to Gln and each O-glycosite Thr/Ser to Ala to minimize the impact on the structure of
S protein. We then measured the titer of each of these 24 pseudotyped virus variants (Fig. 1b) and
tested the interaction between the S protein and its cell receptor, human ACE2 (hACE2), which was

transiently transfected into 5 different cells: 293T-hACE2, Vero-E6-hACE2, A549-hACE2, Calu-1hACE2 and Calu-3-hACE2cells (Fig. 1c).
Results of the 24 pseudotyped viruses showed that disruption of S protein glycosylation led to
an overall impaired infectivity, and among them the three glycosite mutants (N616Q, N657Q and
N709Q) located near the S1/S2 furin cleavage site displayed the minimal impact in 293T cells, a
pattern somewhat consistent in other four cell lines (Fig. 1c). Notably, the four mutations located
within the receptor binding domain (RBD), including N331Q, N343Q, T323A and S325A, all showed
lower virus infections, especially in Vero E cells. Although the RLU-reduction profile varied between
different cell lines in most regions, we identified three mutants with the most drastically reduced
infectivity in all five cells, which are N122Q in the S1 domain, N801Q near the N terminus of S2
domain, and N1194 at the very C terminus of S2 domain (Fig. 1c). This finding underlined the
particular importance of glycans at these specific sites, especially the two sites at S2 domain, N801
and N1194. To further understand their impact on S protein, we purified the recombinant N801Q and
N1194Q S protein mutants to evaluate their properties. As expected, both mutations resulted in
severely decreased protein yield (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b), and N801Q mutant showed additional
degradation bands which were usually not seen in other mutants (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The
N1194Q mutant, on the other hand, did not cause such degradation but existed as a monomer on sizeexclusion chromatography (Extended Data Fig. 3c). These results demonstrated that N-linked
glycans at specific positions differentially affected S protein integrity and the subsequent viral
infectivity.

Site-specific glycan analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein from BEAS-2B and HEK293 cells.
Until now most of the published studies used SARS-CoV-2 S protein expressed from HEK293
cells, which are not the primary host in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The glycosylation profile of the S
protein from HEK293 cells could be different from lung epithelial cells19; therefore, the information
on glycosylation mediated mechanism may not be accurate. The S protein was therefore expressed
from human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (ATCC CRL-9609) and from human kidney epithelial
cell line HEK293T, and the glycan profile was analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2a).
The N-glycan profile of S protein from BEAS-2B displays more abundance of complex-type
glycan structures containing more sialic acids compared to that from HEK293T cells (Fig. 2a, b).
There are two sites on BEAS-2B displaying principally the oligomannose-type (N234 and N717),
and a mixture of oligomannose- and complex-type glycans can be found at sites N61, N122, N801
and N1074. It is worth noting that N234, N717 and N801 display an abundance of Man7-Man8 highmannose structures, suggesting that the mannosidase processing is stalled when it enters the cis-Golgi
(Extended Data Fig. 4). The remaining 16 sites are highly processed complex-type glycan structures.
In addition, almost all the sialylated complex-type glycans apart from N17 and N149 have high degree
of fucosylation, indicating that N17 and N149 are not processed by fucosyltransferase 8 in the medialGolgi. Furthermore, with the Oxford classifications our data demonstrated that N74, N149, N1098,
N1158, and N1194, dominated by complex-type glycans, were more highly processed (i.e., multiple

antennae) and elaborated (i.e., galactosylation, fucosylation and sialylation) than other sites
(Extended Data Fig. 4). In general, we observed a high degree of sialylation for all 22 sites. Notably,
there are more enriched sialic-acid-containing complex-type N-glycans from BEAS-2B (51%) than
from HEK293T (35%) or HEK293E (26%) (Extended Data Table 1, 2, 3). The N-glycosites sites
with predominantly highly processed sialylated complex-type glycans include N74, N149, N165,
N282, N331, N343, N657, N1098, N1158 and N1194, while N1134 and N1173 have decreased sialic
acids (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Table 1, 2, 3). The glycan occupancy on the two N-glycosites (N331
and N343) of RBD are highly sialylated in Beas-2B, while the degree of sialylation in 293T is
significantly lower. (Fig. 2a)
In contrast, although the complex type glycans still occupied dominantly (60%) on HEK293T
N-glycosite, the N-glycan profiles showed that greater amount of hybrid type glycans was detected
on the HEK293T than Beas-2B. The N-glycan profiles of HEK293T cells showed that two of the sites
(N234, and N717) displayed more than 50% high-mannose glycans. We observed Man5GlcNAc2
structure as a predominant oligomannose-type glycan across the protein, and N234 and N717 were
dominated by the high mannose structures Man8GlcNAc2 and Man7GlcNAc2, respectively (Fig. 2a,
Extended Data Fig. 5, Extended Data Table 2), consistent with the recent report 13. Seven of the Nglycosites (N61, N122, N603, N709, N801, N1074 and N1098) contained a combination of high
mannose, hybrid-type and complex-type glycans. There are 8 N-glycosites (N74, N165, N282, N331,
N343, N1158, N1173, and N1194) with highly processed complex-type glycan structures, and only
one site (N717) had 65% high mannose and 28% hybrid structures. Furthermore, the three C-terminal
sites (N1158, N1173, and N1194) contain more complex-type glycans than other sites (Fig. 2a, c,
Extended Data Table 2). Overall, the data showed that the N-glycan profiles of HEK293T displayed
more high mannose and hybrid-type N-glycans and underprocessed glycan antennae (i.e., underGlcNAcylation/galactosylation and under-sialylation), and the S protein from Beas-2B contains more
sialylated complex-type N-glycans that facilitate binding to the receptor. Since most of the published
studies used the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced in human embryonic kidney cell lines (HEK293T
or HEK293F)9,13,14, but not the lung epithelial cells, which are the primary cell for SARS-CoV-2
infection, the different glycosylation profile of S protein from lung epithelial cells may have major
impact on viral infection and antigen presentation in the immune system.
Analysis of S protein glycosylation and its influence on the conserved epitopes
The profile of S protein glycosylation further encouraged us to conduct the structural analysis to
understand which residues are exposed at the protein surface but shielded by the glycans, and whether
these residues are more prone to antigenic variation during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Multiple
alignment results using 1,117,474 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein sequences extracted from GISAID10
(version: Apr. 18, 2021) revealed that the NTD domain has a much lower percentage of conserved
residues (79.1%) than the RBD (93.3%) or the S2 region (93.81% on average), in which a mutation
rate >0.1% is considered not conserved (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 7, Extended Data Table 4).
Indeed, the RBD, Fusion Peptide (FP), Heptad Repeat 2 (HR2) contain higher percentage of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.25.445523; this version posted May 25, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

conserved epitopes (33.63%, 42.11% and 62.75%) in their exposed residues than other regions
(Extended Data Fig. 8, Extended Data Table 4), and the conservation analysis of S protein
glycosylation sites reinforces the idea that the sites at the RBD (N331, N343 and S325), FP (N801)
and near HR2 (N1074, N1098, N1134, N1158, N1073, and N1194) are extremely conserved
(Extended Data Fig. 9a), all of which resulted in moderate to severe infection defects when mutated,
as demonstrated in the pseudotyped virus studies (Fig. 1c). Mapping of glycan coverage and sequence
conservation statistics on S protein structure displayed a consistent pattern of unburied clusters and
highly conserved but glycan shielded regions, including the lower side of RBD, the non-complex type
glycan belt nearby FP and the HR1 (Fig. 2b-e). However, when we focused only on the exposed
residues, we found that while NTD may not be a good target for epitope study due to the overall high
mutation rate, its conservation percentage raised a lot when only including the glycan shielded areas
(82.9%) compared to unshielded areas (63.3%) (Extended Data Fig. 9). Moreover, an overall
increase of conservation rate between glycan-shielded and unshielded residues for HR2 was observed,
in which all its 14 shielded residues are highly conserved (100%) compared to only 81.8% for the
unshielded ones (Extended Data Fig. 9b). These results again highlighted the significance of S
protein glycosylation both functionally and evolutionarily, bringing forth an idea that removal of the
S protein glycan shield may expose more highly conserved regions for eliciting neutralizing
antibodies in a more efficient way.

Vaccination with monoglycosylated S protein (Smg) provides better protection against SARSCoV-2 infection in vivo
Based on the study of glycosylation in SARS-CoV-2 infection as described above, we decided
to design S protein vaccines through glycoengineering to remove the glycans that may interfere with
the presentation of conserved epitopes, with the hope to develop more broadly protective vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our initial attempt to remove S protein glycans by combining
glycosite mutations led to a dramatically reduced expression of folded S protein, probably due to the
negative impact on protein folding through deletion of multiple glycosites (Extended Data Fig. 3).
This problem however may not be encountered with the use of mRNA as vaccine, as when the
glycoengineered RNA is inside the antigen presenting cells, the translated and unfolded S protein
mutant may still be processed for presentation to T cells, and work is in progress to validate this
approach. An alternative strategy was to generate S protein with all high-mannose glycans using
GnTI-/- cells and perform the glycan trimming with enzymes after the S protein is fully folded,
secreted, and purified20,21. Endoglycosidase H (Endo H) was used to cleave the high-mannose glycans
to N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) at each N-glycosylation site (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b, c),
generating the monoglycosylated form of S protein (Smg) (Fig. 3a), which was further confirmed to
be near 100% pure and fully soluble (Extended Data Fig. 10 d, e). This modified Smg and the fully
glycosylated S protein (Sfg) were used to immunize BALB/c mice (n=5) with two injections (20ug
antigen with 20ug aluminum hydroxide) (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 11). Sfg is similar to the

immunogens used in many current COVID-19 vaccines which were either approved or in clinical
trials, including the insect cell expressed S protein vaccines from companies such as Sanofi22 and
Novavax23, the human cell expressed recombinant S-2p vaccine from Medigen24, the adenovirusbased vaccines from AstraZeneca25 and J&J26, and mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech27
and Moderna28.
The Smg immunized mice induced superior humoral immune response than Sfg, with a 2.1-fold
higher anti-S IgG avidity (~1.2 x 105) than that by Sfg (~5.6 x 104) in week 6 after the first
immunization (Fig. 3b, c) and a stronger neutralizing antibody response in the neutralization test
based on inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) assay (Fig. 3d). The protective efficacy by vaccination
of Smg vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19/Taiwan/4/2020) in Syrian hamster model29 (n = 5)
was higher with less reduction in body weight as compared to the Sfg and PBS groups (Fig. 3b, e).
The virus titers in the lungs of both Sfg and Smg vaccinated hamsters were found to be 104-fold
reduction compared with the PBS control, while no virus staining with anti-N antibody was detected
in lung of both Sfg and Smg vaccinated hamster (Fig. 3f, i) The pathological score also indicated that
less lesion was found in Smg immunized hamster lung. (Fig. 3j, Extended Data Fig. 12). Since
hamsters only showed mild-to-moderate sickness upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we also conducted
vaccination experiments in the severe-disease model using highly susceptible CAG-hACE2
transgenic mice30 (n = 3) (Fig. 3b). SARS-CoV-2 (1x103 TCID50) was used to challenge the mice
intranasally, and the Sfg group failed to protect mice from severe disease, as a rapid decease of body
weights (up to 20% loss of weight at 7 dpi for all) was observed, only slightly better than the adjuvant
control (Fig. 3k). In contract, the Smg group exhibited only mild weight loss (~ 5.75% at 7 dpi) with
an 100% survival rate compared to the Sfg and adjuvant group (0% at 7 dpi) (Fig. 3k, l). Moreover,
unlike such a large difference in disease progression between these groups, the neutralizing antibody
titers of Sfg vaccinated hACE2 mice were only 2.8-fold less than that of the Smg group, indicating that
the humoral immune response may not be the only factor contributing to vaccine efficacy (Fig. 3g,
h). The exciting findings that Smg induced an all-improved immune response and protection again
proved the importance of S protein glycosylation in vaccine design, and removal of its glycan shield
has successfully generated an immunogen which exposes more conserved residues for the host cells
to elicit efficient immune response.
In addition to the improved efficacy, this glyoengineered Smg vaccine was also found to induce
a broader protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants including the currently dominant D614G strain,
the UK variant (B.1.1.7), and the South Africa variant (B.1.351)31-35 (Fig. 4a). The B.1.1.7 variant,
which originated from UK and now is circulating dominantly in North America and Europe, showed
2-to-3-fold reduction in neutralizing activity in the serum of patients vaccinated with AstraZeneca,
Pfizer-BioNTech and CoronaVac vaccines and resistance to some anti-RBD monoclonal
antibodies33,34,36-38. The South Africa B.1.351 variant is highly resistant to several therapeutic
antibodies and even the convalescent sera, and exhibited reduced protection by many approved
vaccines35-37,39-41. The pseudotyped viruses of these variants were then tested for both Smg and Sfg
immunized sera, and the Smg vaccine showed a superior neutralization ability towards the D614G,

B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains, with the pNT50 being 1.4-, 2.7- and 1.5-fold better than Sfg (Fig. 4c, d).
Compared with Sfg, the Smg vaccine also elicited better spike-specific IgG titer to not only spike
protein from WT (Wuhan/WH01/2019), but also from the variants D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, bat CoV
RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. 4a, b). Finally, in the SARS-CoV-2 real virus plague reduction
neutralization assay, the Smg vaccine again displayed a better neutralizing antibody response to
D614G and B.1.1.7 variants as compared with Sfg, with 2.0- and 1.4-fold increase, respectively (Fig.
4e, f). All these data supported that removal of unnecessary glycans from S protein can effectively
aid in the development of broadly protective vaccines and also increase the chance of identifying
broadly neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Identification of a broadly neutralizing antibody from B cells of mice immunized with Smg
We further examined the frequency of spike-specific B cells (CD3−CD19+S+) from the spleen of
mice immunized with Sfg or Smg by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Compared
with Sfg immunized mice, Smg immunized mice generated significantly higher frequency of S-specific
B cells (Fig. 5a, b). We next sorted S-specific B cells from Smg immunized mice for single B cell
screening of monoclonal antibody (mAb) against S protein, which led to one resultant chimeric mAb,
m31A7, with an excitingly high affinity (10-10 ~ 10-11 M) in binding to HEK293T cells that express S
protein from all the tested SARS-CoV-2 strains including the original Wuhan (Wuhan/WH01/2019),
D614G, UK (B.1.1.7), and South Africa (B.1.351) variants, as measured by FACS (Fig. 5c).
Additionally, we found that m31A7 binds to the RBD of S protein as ELISA results showed that
m31A7 binds to full length, S1 and RBD, but not S2, of SARS-CoV-2 (WH01) S protein, indicating
a potential interference with ACE2 recognition during virus infection (Fig. 5d). Indeed, m31A7 was
successfully proven to neutralize both WH01 and various SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus variants
(D614G, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351) at sub-picomolar IC50 (Fig. 5g). The findings that S protein binding
and virus neutralization by this mAb identified from Smg immunized mice were not affected by S
protein mutations of these variants reinforced the idea that Smg immunization may increase the chance
of eliciting broad-spectrum antibodies (Fig. 5c, g). Moreover, binding kinetics using bio-layer
interferometry (BLI) showed that m31A7 bound to S protein and to RBD with a dissociation constant
(KD) value at sub-picomolar and nanomolar avidities, respectively. Compared to the binding with
full-length S protein, m31A7 IgG bound to RBD with faster dissociation rate (koff) (6.39 × 10-6 ± 9.75
× 10-7 s-1 to S and 4.56 × 10-4 ± 1.03 × 10-6 s-1 to RBD, respectively) (Fig. 5e), while m31A7 Fab
bound to both molecules with comparable binding affinities (KD) (2.19 × 10-10 ± 8.89 × 10-12 M to S
and 5.84 × 10-10 ± 2.91 × 10-12 M to RBD) (Fig. 5f). These results have not only suggested that
bivalent m31A7 can stabilize the interaction with S protein, thereby providing high avidity, but also
highlighted its high affinity comparable to or higher than many other mAbs identified recently6,42,43.
Taken together, the monoglycosylated S protein (Smg) vaccine has the potential to induce broadly
neutralizing antibodies with high affinities.
In conclusion, S protein glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 is significant for virus infection and is
complicated among different glycosites with differential glycan profile from different cell lines. The

two important glycosites identified in this paper, N801 located on the non-complex-type glycan belt
in the S2 domain, and N1194 near the very C-terminus of the fusion-related HR2 region, have taken
us one step further towards the mechanistic understanding of S protein. These findings together with
the analysis of its glycoform abundance, glycan shielding, sequence variations and their mutual
correlations further brought forth the idea of a monoglycosylated S protein vaccine, Smg, from which
essentially all glycan shields are removed, presenting a superior immunogen where all peptide
sequence in S protein may be used as epitopes, and proven to provide better protection than
conventional protein vaccines. The B cells from Smg immunization paved the way for the
identification of a high-avidity broad-spectrum monoclonal antibody capable of neutralizing both UK
and South Africa virus variants, with many more to be explored. The potential impact of surface
protein glycosylation on the viral infection and immune response to the current circulating SARSCoV-2 and future variants shall never be underestimated and the collective knowledge of this virus
will benefit the accelerated development of a broad-spectrum COVID-19 vaccine.

and virus entry. a, Schematic overview of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein primary structure
colored by domain: N-terminal domain (NTD, 16–291), receptor binding domain (RBD, 319–528),
SD1 (or CTD1, 529-591), SD2 (or CTD2, 192-685), furin cleavage site (S1/S2 at 685), fusion peptide
I (FPI, 788-806), fusion peptide II (FP II or internal fusion peptide, 816-834), fusion peptide III (875901), heptad repeat 1 (HR1, 902-986), central helix (CH, 987–1034), connecting domain (CD, 1080–
1135), heptad repeat 2 (HR2, 1163–1210) domain, transmembrane domain (TM, 1214–1234), and
cytoplasmic tail (CT, 1235–1273)13,44. Representative icons for N-glycan ( ) and O-glycan ( ) are
also marked with amino acid number. b, The amount of pseudovirus packaged by SARS-CoV-2 S
proteins containing indicated glycosylation mutations. Individual sites were marked with the colors
corresponding to the domains shown in a and O-glycosylation sites were marked in yellow. The virus
titer was quantitated by measuring p24 levels in the pseudovirus packaged with wild-type SARSCoV-2 spike or individual glycosylation mutants. The p24 levels measured with the pseudovirus
packaged with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycosylation mutants were normalized against the p24 level
measured in the pseudovirus packaged with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (defined as 1).
Values shown are mean + standard deviation of the normalized p24 levels from three independent
experiments. c, Impact of glycosylation on the infectivity of pseudovirus containing wild-type spike
or spike with indicated glycosite mutations. Equal virus titers of the pseudovirus packaged by SARSCoV-2 spike protein containing indicated glycosite mutations were used to infect the cells (HEK293T,
Vero, and lung cells A549, Calu-1, Calu-3) expressing human ACE2 for 48 h and the infection
efficiency was measured by luciferase activity. The relative luminescence unit (RLU) was measured

Extended Data Fig. 1. Impact of glycosylation on the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to
human ACE2. Wild type SARS-CoV-2 S protein was either produced from HEK 293T (complex
type, red) or HEK293S (high mannose, blue) cells. Furthermore, S proteins from HEK293S were
processed with Endo H to remove oligomannose N-glycan to produce monoglycosylated spike
proteins (green). The ACE2 binding activities of S proteins containing various N-glycans were
measured by ELISA. Shown are the absorbance at 450 nm.

Extended Data Fig. 2. Impact of cleavage sites and C-terminal deletion of spike on pseudovirus
production. a, Pseudoviruses were produced using HIV packaging system with spike of SARS-CoV
(blank) or with spike of SARS-CoV-2. Wild-type spike (black), deletion of 27 amino acids from Cterminus (∆27) (blue) or deletion of 19 amino acid from C-terminus (∆19) (red) of spike protein were
used for pseudovirus production. The addition of HIV sequence (NRVRQGYS) after deletions
(striped blue and striped red) were also tested for pseudovirus production. Equal volumes of collected
medium were used to infected 293-ACE2 cells for 48 h and the infection efficiency were measured
by luciferase activity. The relative luminescence unit (RLU) was measured. Showed values are mean
± SD. b, The original furin cleavage site of spike proteins from SARS-CoV (blank) or SARS-CoV-2
(black) were changed to KRRKR. The impacts of cleavage sites of wild-type spike (black), spike with
a deletion of 27 amino acids from C-terminus (∆27) (blue) or spike with a deletion of 19 amino acid
from C-terminus (∆19) (red) were also tested. Equal volumes of collected medium were used to infect
293-ACE2 cells for 48 h and the infection efficiency was measured by luciferase activity. The relative

Extended Data Fig. 3. Expression test of recombinant S protein with glycosite mutation. a,
Expression levels of S protein constructs carrying different mutations (as noted) in HEK293 Ebna
suspension cell cultures tested by western blot using anti-penta-histidine monoclonal antibody.
Expression tests were performed in three batches, each with the wild type as the positive control.
Choice of amino acid change is based on S protein variation statistics from GISAID to maximize the
similarity with the circulating virus variants. The reduced expression level could be due to the
influence of mutation on either protein solubility or protein integrity during folding or after secretion.
The combination of several tolerable glycosite mutations shows a threshold of four or more mutations
which start to severely reduce the expression level while it is tolerable for each single mutation. b,
Mapping the glycosite mutation tolerance on S protein 3D structure (PDB 7CN9) shown with glycan
chains modeled in sticks on surface. N-glycan sites and adhering glycans were colored according to
the results in a. Green indicates the tolerable sites, orange and red colors indicate severe reduction
and complete loss of expression when mutated, and purple colors are the sites strictly conserved in
which mutagenesis was not tried. Expression-critical sites are labeled with the residue number. c,
Size-exclusion chromatography of two selective N-glycosite mutants, N801Q (left) and N1194Q
(right), with their elution fractions individually checked with western blot using rabbit anti-S protein
(14-1209) polyclonal antibodies to confirm protein identity at extremely low concentrations, as these
mutations severely diminished the S protein expression level. The S-N801Q mutant has an additional
degradation band (possibly S1) and S-N1194 mutant exhibits a big peak shift on SEC compared to
the trimeric wild type, indicating these sites may be important for S protein integrity and/or
trimerization.

Material and Methods
Informatic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein. The 1,117,474 spike protein sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 and their variants information by multiple sequence alignment were extracted from the
GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) database10 (version: Apr. 18, 2021). The
S-protein 3D structure modeling of SARS-CoV-2 with representative glycan profile was constructed
by CHARMM-GUI46 and OpenMM47 programs. The input of CHARMM-GUI includes the PDB file
(model: 1_1_1)4, the representative glycan profile, and parameter settings. The representative glycan
structure of each N-glycosite is the most abundant glycan expressed in Beas-2B lung cells in this
work. For O-glycans (T323 and S325), we used the Neu5Ac(α2,3)Gal(β1,3)GalNAc(α1) as
representatives.44 The definition of transmembrane region of S-protein is according to the record of
Uniport (P0DTC2) and other parameters in CHARMM-GUI and were the same parameters used in
the study by Woo, H. et al.48. The default scripts, parameters, and pre-optimized model generated by
CHARMM-GUI were used as the input for the OpenMM program. Protein secondary structure was
determined by majority voting of three protein chains given by the DSSP program49,50 in 2Struc web
service51. Relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of the S-protein was calculated by the FreeSASA
program52. The final RSA of each residue was the average RSA of residues in three protein chains
from all frames of 3D modeling. The probe radius in the FreeSASA program was set to 7.2Å to
approximate the average size of the hypervariable loops in the CDR of an antibody9. Residues with
RSA >5% are regarded as exposed residues; otherwise, they are regarded as buried residues. The
protein 3D visualization in Figure 1 and Figure S1(A) were drawn by the PyMOL program53.
Cell culture. HEK 293T (Homo sapiens, embryonic kidney), HEK293T-ACE2 (293T cells stably
expressed hACE2), Vero E6 (Cercopithecus aethiops, kidney), Vero E6-ACE2 (Vero E6 cells stably
expressed hACE2), A549 (Homo sapiens, lung) and A549-ACE2 cells (A549 cells stably expressed
hACE2) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, high glucose; GIBCO,
Cat#11995065). Calu1 (Homo sapiens, lung) and Calu1-ACE2 cells (Calu1 cells stably expressed
hACE2) were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (GIBCO, Cat#11330032). Calu3 (Homo sapiens, lung) and
Calu3-ACE2 cells (Calu3 cells stably expressed hACE2) were cultured in Minimum Essential
Medium (MEM; GIBCO, Cat#11095080). BEAS-2B (Homo sapiens, lung) were cultured in RPMI
1640 (GIBCO, Cat#22400089). All the cells above were cultured in medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO, Cat#10437028) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (GIBCO,
Cat#15140122). HEK293EBNA (ATCC number CRL-10852) and HEK293S GnTI¯ (ATCC® CRL3022™) cells were cultured in Freestyle 293 expression medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with
0.5% bovine calf serum.
Specific glycosylation site mutation and pseudotyped virus assay. For pseudoviruses construction,
the full-length S gene was codon-optimized for human cells and several additional variants of S gene
were created, including those modified with C-terminal 19 or 27 amino acids deletion, incorporated
the eight most membrane-proximal residues of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein cytoplasmic domain
(NRVRQGYS) (1) and amino acid positions 812 and 813 changed into arginine to make the

recognition sequence of furin-like protease, KRRKR (2) to facilitate efficient pseudotype formation.
Pseudotyped viruses incorporated with spike protein from either full-length, variants or glycosylation
mutants were constructed and cloned into expression plasmid pVax to generate the envelope
recombinant plasmids.
For production of pseudotyped viruses and for the assay of virus entry, the day before
transfection, HEK293T cells should be plated 18 to 24 h prior to transfection so that the cell density
should be 50-80% confluent at the time of transfection. Luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome plasmid
(pNL4-3.luc.RE) and a plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, other representative spike constructs
in different variants, or glycosylation mutants were co-transfected according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The vesicular stomatitis virus-G (VSV-G) protein was served as a control to evaluate
entry efficiency. After overnight incubation, the transfected cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with fresh culture medium for another 24 h. Viral supernatants were then collected, clarified
to remove cell debris by centrifugation and filtered through 0.45-μm syringe filters, and stored at -80
°C until use. To transduce cells with pseudovirions, cells were seeded into Poly-D-Lysine 96-well
plates and inoculated with 100 μl media containing pseudovirions. Media were changed 24 h postinfection. About 48 h post inoculation, cells were lysed with 60μl of Glo lysis buffer at room
temperature for 5 min and mix 40μl of cell lysate with 100μl of Luciferase Assay System (Promega).
The transduction efficiency was measured by quantification of the luciferase activity using a
CLARIOstar plate-reader.
To construct SARS-CoV-2 spike glycosylation mutants, the codon-optimized S gene of SARSCoV-2 was synthesized by Genscript and cloned into pcDNA to generate mammalian expression
constructs or pVax to obtain pseudoviruses constructs, and the resulting plasmid was used as the
template for site-directed mutagenesis. The N-glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV-2 S were predicted
with The NetNGly server provided by Expasy (www.expasy.org). The putative N-X-S/T sequons
were then mutated to Q-X-S/T using QuikChange Lightning Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(Agilent Technologies). Reverse primers were designed for the target mutation sites. Following sitedirected mutagenesis PCR, the amplification products were digested using DpnI restriction
endonuclease. Afterward, the PCR product was directly used to transform XL10-Gold ultracompetent
cells; single clones were selected and then confirmed by DNA sequencing. The specific mutation sites
of the primers for the glycosylation mutants are listed in Extended Data Table 1.
For quantification of pseudotyped virus particles using HIV-1 Gag p24 ELISA, the titer of HIV1-based pseudotyped virus particles was quantitatively determined using standard ELISA methods
(R&D Systems). A monoclonal antibody specific for HIV-1 Gag p24 was pre-coated onto a microplate.
Target pseudotyped viruses were diluted in 1000, 1500, 2000, 5000 and 10000-fold, while HIV-1 Gag
p24 standard was prepared as 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, 7.81, and 0 pg/ml as standards.
Standards and samples are dispensing into appropriately labeled duplicate wells and any HIV-1 Gag
p24 present is bound by the immobilized antibody. After washing away any unbound substances, a
monoclonal antibody specific for human HIV-1 Gag p24 is added to the wells. Following a wash to
remove any unbound reagent, a 200 μl of substrate solution is added to each well for color to develop
in 7 min. The color development is stopped by adding 50 μl of stop solution and the intensity of the

color is measured. The absorbance values at 450 nm was read using SpectraMax M5 (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A standard curve was obtained by plotting the absorbance versus the
corresponding concentration of the standard. The HIV-1 Gag p24 concentration of the sample can be
then calculated from the standard curve, and HIV-1 Gag p24 values can then be correlated to virus
titer of packaging cell supernatants.
Plasmid constructions, expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in HEK293T and
BEAS-2B cells. SARS-CoV-2 S protein stable trimer with a HisTag is the ectodomain of SARS-CoV2 S protein which contains residues 1-1208. Proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987 were used
to stabilize the trimeric prefusion state and residues 682-685 replaced by a “GSAS” sequence was
used to abolish the furin cleavage site. The transmembrane domain was replaced with additional
residues from the bacteriophage T4 fibritin foldon trimerization motif (3), thrombin cleavage site and
6xHisTag at the C-terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was created and subsequently cloned into
the mammalian expression vector pcDNA. This expression vector was used to transiently transfect
human epithelial kidney (HEK) 293T cells or BEAS-2B (Homo sapiens, lung) using Mirus TransIT®LT1 (Mirus Bio) transfection reagent. Prior to transfection, cells were replaced with the fresh
corresponding medium supplemented. The TransIT®-LT1 reagent/DNA complex was added to the
cells and incubated for 72 h at 37 ºC. Proteins was purified from cell supernatants using Ni-NTA
affinity column (GE Healthcare). The purified SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were concentrated by Amicon
Ultrafiltration Unit (MW100K cutoff) (Millipore) in PBS, pH 7.4. The purity was monitored by using
SDS-PAGE and the proteins were confirmed using Western blot with anti-(his)6 antibodies (Qiagen)
or specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (PerkinElmer). Finally, the trimer form of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins were obtained by using
size-exclusion column, Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare).
Plasmid constructions, expression and purification of human ACE2 protein. The soluble
ectodomain of human ACE2 protein with sequence (1-615 or 1-740) fused with a 8xHisTag at the Cterminus was synthesized by Genscript and cloned to the vector pcDNA. For Human ACE2 proteins,
the expression construct was transfected in HEK 293T cells using Mirus TransIT®-LT1. Human
ACE2 protein was purified from cell supernatants using Ni-NTA resin (GE Healthcare). The purified
proteins were concentrated using Amicon (Millipore) and further purified by gel filtration
chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare).
ELISA determination for SARS-CoV-2 S and human ACE2 protein binding. Ninety-six-well
ELISA plates (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with 100 μl of human ACE2
protein diluted in ELISA coating buffer, 100 mM sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.8), at a concentration of
2 μg/ml per well were covered with a plastic sealer at 4 °C for overnight. After blocked with 1% BSA
in PBST (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% Tween 20, pH
7.4) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk at 37 °C for 1 h and washed 3 times with PBST, the plates were
incubated with 100 μl of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in 2-fold serial dilutions at 37 ºC for 1 h. After
washes with PBST, the plates were incubated with anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody (1:2000) at 37 °C

for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBST three times and then incubated with 200 μl of secondary
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After 1 h of incubation
at 37 ºC, the plates were washed 3 times with PBST and developed with 50 μl of the 1-Step Ultra
TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific) for 4 min. The reaction was stopped with addition of 50 μl of 1
M H2SO4. The absorbance of wells was measured at 450 nm using a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Plasmid constructions, expression and purification of recombinant S protein vaccine. The
SARS-CoV-2 spike sequence was downloaded from GISAID database, (Wuhan/WH01/2019 strain)
and was codon optimized for human cell expression. The furin cleavage site was replaced with GSAG
and the 2P substitution was applied for protein to be stabilized in the prefusion state. The
transmembrane domain was replaced with the thrombin cleavage site, foldon, and the histidine-tag at
the C terminus. The modified S protein sequence was cloned into pTT vector for protein expression
and purification.20
Expression and purification methods are modified from the previously published.21 The plasmid
that encodes the secreted form of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was transfected into the human embryonic
kidney cell lines of either HEK293EBNA (ATCC number CRL-10852) or the HEK293S GnTI¯ cells
using polyethyleneimine. The supernatant was collected 5-6 days after transfection and clarified by
centrifugation. Sfg was purified as described earlier. Shm protein was purified with Nickel-chelation
chromatography and eluted fractions were concentrated by a Millipore Amicon Ultra Filter (100 kDa)
and loaded onto a Superpose 6 gel filtration column (10/300 GL, Cytiva) preequilibrated with 20mM
Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, with the corresponding trimer fractions pooled and further
concentrated. The purified Shm was treated with Endo H (NEB) overnight at room temperature in a
ratio of 1:100 (w/w) to produce Smg protein with a single GlcNAc at each N-glycosylation site. For
Endo H removal, Smg was either purified through buffer exchange using Millipore Amicon Ultra Filter
(100 kDa) for three times, or repurified by size-exclusion chromatography using ENrich SEC 650 (10
x 300 column; Bio-Rad) preequilibrated in the same buffer as above. Then, to check the protein purity,
samples were mixed with SDS loading buffer, separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and stained by
Coomassie Brilliant Blue-Plus (EBL).
N-Linked glycosylation profile on SARS-CoV-2 S protein by mass spectrometry. 20 μg of SARSCoV-2 S protein, purified from three different cell lines, in three independent biological replicates,
were incubated at 55°C for 1h in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing
10 mM of tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine. Next, the reduced S protein was alkylated by adding 18
mM iodoacetamide (IAA) and the mixture was incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.
The alkylated proteins were digested separately using different proteases and their combinations:
chymotrypsin and alpha lytic protease at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w), or trypsin at a ratio of 1:20 (w/w). All
proteases are in sequencing grade (Promega). After an overnight digestion at 37°C, the samples were
acidified and processed for LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry)
analysis. Glycans categorization follows previous studies according to the composition detected and
visualized by Graphpad Prism 9.0.0.13

Animal vaccination and virus challenge. For mice vaccination study, female 6- to 8-week-old
BALB/c mice (n= 5) were immunized intramuscularly with 20ug purified Sfg or Smg proteins mixed
with aluminum hydroxide (20ug) at day 0, day 14 and day 56. Blood was collected at week 4, 6, 8,
10 and 12 after first immunization, and serum samples were collected from each mouse.
For hamster vaccination study and virus challenge study, female 6- to 7-week-old Golden Syrian
Hamsters (n= 5) were immunized intramuscularly with 25ug of purified Sfg or Smg proteins mixed
with aluminum hydroxide (250ug) at day 0 and day 14. Blood was collected 28 days and 42 days
after first immunization, and serum samples were collected from each hamster. Hamsters were
challenged at 4 weeks after second vaccination with 1 x 104 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 TCDC#4 (hCoV19/Taiwan/4/2020, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_411927) intranasally in a volume of 100 μl per
hamster. Body weight for each hamster was recorded daily after infection. On day 3 after challenge,
hamsters were euthanized by carbon dioxide. The superior lobe of left lung was fixed in 10%
paraformaldehyde for histopathological examination and the rest of lung was collected for viral load
determination (TCID50 assay).
For transgenic mice vaccination and virus challenge study, male 8-week-old CAG-hACE2
transgenic mice (n= 3) were immunized intramuscularly with 10 ug of purified Sfg or Smg proteins
mixed with aluminum hydroxide (50 ug) at day 0 and day 14.30 Blood was collected 28 days and 42
days after first immunization, and serum samples were collected from each transgenic mouse.
Transgenic mice were challenged at 6 weeks after second vaccination with 1 x 103 TCID50 of SARSCoV-2 TCDC#4 (hCoV-19/Taiwan/4/2020, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_411927) intranasally in
a volume of 50 μL per mice. Body weight and body temperature for each transgenic mouse were

dioxide. The superior lobe of left lung was fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for histopathological
examination and the rest of lung was collected for viral load determination (TCID50 assay).
All animal experiments were evaluated and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Academia Sinica.
Histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.
Hamster organs at 3 dpi were immediately collected and placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
fixation for 24 h, then transferred into 70% ethanol for 72 h. Paraffin-embedded organs tissues were
trimmed to the thickness of 5 mm. For histological staining, tissue was stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H & E), followed by microscopic examination. The histopathological scoring system was used
for evaluating lung section cumulative histopathology score.54 For immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining, the tissue sectioned were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol gradient.
Antigen retrieval was performed by heating the slides to 95oC for 10 min in 10 mM sodium citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven. After cooling at room temperature and washing with PBS, 3%
H2O2 was pplied to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. The tissue sectioned were blocked
with 5% normal goat serum and 1 % BSA in 1x PBST for 1 h, followed by incubation with rabbit
anti-N primary antibody at 1:50 dilution (Anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody) overnight at 4oC.
Then the tissue was incubated with goat anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody at 1:500 dilutions for 1

h and visualized by incubation with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate and counterstained with
hematoxylin. For immunofluorescence staining, after antigen retrieval steps, tissue was
permeabilized with Triton X-100 in PBS. The tissue sectioned were blocked with 5% normal goat
serum and 1% BSA in 1x PBST for 1 h. Then, incubated with an autofluorescence quencher for 5
min. The samples were subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-N primary antibody at 1:50 dilution
(Anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal antibody) overnight at 4oC, secondary antibody Alexa Fluor-488
(1:500, Thermo Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature, and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a
nuclear dye for 3 min at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and
imaged under a Leica TCS SP8X confocal microscope with HC PL APO CS2 10x/0.40 lens (Leica
AG, Wetzlar, Germany).
Sera antibody titer evaluation. Anti-S protein ELISA were used to determine sera IgG titer. Plates
were first coated with 50 ng/well of S protein expressed by HEK293EBNA (Sfg) and then blocked
with 5% skim milk. Mouse polyclonal anti-S protein primary antibody and HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody were sequentially added. Peroxidase substrate solution (TMB) and 1M H2SO4
stop solution were used and absorbance (OD 450 nm) read by a microplate reader. Tested strains
included SARS-CoV-2 variants (wild type, variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.135), RaTG13, and SARS-CoV1.
Quantification of viral titer in lung tissue by cell culture infectious assay (TCID50). The middle,
inferior, and post-caval lung lobes of hamsters were homogenized in 4 ml of DMEM with 2% FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin using a homogenizer. Tissue homogenate was centrifuged and the
supernatant was collected for live virus titration. Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of each sample were
added onto Vero E6 cell monolayer in duplicate and incubated for 4 days and cells were observed by
microscope daily. The plates were washed with tap water and scored for infection. The fifty-percent
tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) / ml was calculated by the Reed and Muench method.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay for serum and antibody study. For production and purification
of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus, the pseudotyped lentivirus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S protein
was generated by transiently transfecting HEK-293T cells with pCMV-ΔR8.91, pLAS2w.Fluc. Ppuro
and pcDNA3.1-nCoV-SΔ18 (or pcDNA3.1-nCoV-SΔ18 D614G). HEK-293T cells were seeded one
day before transfection, and indicated plasmids were delivered into cells by using TransITR-LT1
transfection reagent (Mirus). The culture medium was refreshed at 16 h and harvested at 48 h and 72h
post-transfection. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 4,000 xg for 10 min, and the
supernatant was passed through 0.45 μm syringe filter (Pall Corporation). The pseudotyped lentivirus
was aliquot and then stored at -80°C.
To estimate the lentiviral titer by AlarmaBlue assay, the transduction unit (TU) of SARS-CoV-2
peudotyped lentivirus was estimated by using cell viability assay in responded to the limited dilution
of lentivirus. In brief, HEK-293T cells stably expressing human ACE2 gene were plated on 96-well
plate one day before lentivirus transduction. For determining the titer of pseudotyped lentivirus,

concentration 8 μg/ml). Spin infection was carried out at 1,100 xg in 96-well plate for 30 min at 37°C.
After incubating cells at 37°C for 16 h, the culture medium containing virus and polybrene was
removed and replaced with fresh complete DMEM containing 2.5 μg/ml puromycin. After treating
puromycin for 48 h, the culture media was removed and the cell viability was detected by using 10%
AlarmaBlue reagents according to manufacturer’s instruction. The survival rate of uninfected cells
(without puromycin treatment) was set as 100%. The virus titer (transduction units) was determined
by plotting the survival cells versus diluted viral dose.
For performing the pseudotyped lentivirus neutralization assay, for the virus neutralization assay,
heat-inactivated sera or antibodies were serially diluted with desired dilution and incubated with
1,000 TU of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus in DMEM (supplemented with 1% FBS and 100
U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin) for 1 h at 37°C. The mixture was then inoculated with 10,000 HEK293T cells stably expressing human ACE2 gene in 96-well plate. The culture medium was replaced
with fresh complete DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/ml Penicillin/ Streptomycin)
at 16 h post-infection and cells were continuously cultured for another 48 h before performing
luciferase assay. For luciferase assay, the expression level of luciferase gene was determined by using
Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The relative light unit (RLU) was detected by
Tecan i-control (Infinite 500). The percentage of inhibition was calculated as the ratio of RLU
reduction in the presence of diluted serum to the RLU value of no serum control and the calculation
formula was shown below:
(RLU Control - RLU Serum) / RLU Control
Plaque reduction assay. Vero E6 cells were seeded into 24‐well culture plates in DMEM with 10%
FBS and antibiotics 1 day before infection. Sera were heated at 56°C for 30 min to inactivate
complement. SARS‐CoV‐2 D614G variant (hCoV-19/Taiwan/NTU03/2020) or B.1.1.7 (hCoV19/Taiwan/NTU49/2020) was incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 37°C before adding to the cell
monolayer for another hour. Subsequently, virus‐antibody mixtures were removed, and the cell
monolayer was washed once with PBS before covering with media containing 1% methylcellulose
for 5–7 days. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde overnight. After removal of the overlay
media, the cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and the plaques were counted. The percentage
of inhibition was calculated as [1 − (VD/VC)] × 100%, where VD and VC refer to the virus titers in
the presence and absence of the sera, respectively.
CPE-based neutralization assay. For CPE-based neutralization assay, Vero E6 cells were plated
onto a 6-well plate at 2x105 cells/well overnight for 90% confluence. Sera were heated at 56°C for
30 min to inactivate complement and the mixture was diluted in DMEM with 2% FBS and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. The diluted sera were mixed with equal volume of 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV2 TCDC#4 (hCoV-19/Taiwan/4/2020, GISAID accession ID: EPI_ISL_411927) at 37°C for 1 h
before adding onto the monolayer. The plate was then incubated at 37°C until cytopathic effects (CPE)
were observed.

mice were incubated with 2 μg/ml S protein at 4 oC for 1 h, followed by washing and incubation with
an antibody cocktail containing the following antibodies: PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD19 (Biolegend,
6D5), PE-conjugated anti-CD3 (Biolegend, 17A2), and APC-conjugated anti-His (Biolegend,
J095G46), at 4℃ for 15 min. Propidium Iodide was used to exclude dead cells. Stained cells were
washed, analyzed, and sorted for S protein-specific single B cells (CD3−CD19+) by BD FACSAria II
into 96-well PCR plates (Applied Biosystems) containing 10 μl/well catch buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8, 5 U/μl RNasin (Promega)).
Single-B cell screening. Primers were designed based on a previous publication55. The reaction was
then performed at 50 oC for 30 min, 95 oC for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 94 oC for 30 s, 50oC
for 30 s, 72oC for 1 min, and final incubation at 72 oC for 10 min. Semi-nested second round PCR
was performed using KOD One PCR master mix (TOYOBO) with 1 μl of unpurified first round PCR
product at 98 °C for 2 min followed by 45 cycles of 98 oC for 10 s, 55 oC for 10 s, 68 oC for 10 s, and
final incubation at 68 oC for 1 min. PCR products were then analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels and
sequencing. The Ig V and L genes were identified by searching on IMGT website
(http://imgt.org/IMGT_vquest/input). The genes were then amplified from second round PCR
product with single gene-specific V and L gene primers containing restriction sites for cloning into
vectors containing human IgH or IgL expression backbone. The chimeric IgH and IgL expression
constructions were co-transfected into Expi293 for antibody production.
Binding of antibody with S protein expressing 293T surface. 293T cells were transfected with
pcDNA6/Spike-P2A-eGFP. Transfected cells were selected under 10 μg/ml of blasticidin for 2-3
weeks. Selected cells were then sorted by FACSAria II to obtain eGFP+ expressing cells. These cells
were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml of blasticidin. 2-3x105 cells were
incubated with serially diluted antibody in FACS buffer on ice for 1 h. Then, cells were washed with
FACS buffer for 3 times, followed by staining in BV421 mouse anti-human IgG (BD Biosciences,
562581, 1:100) on ice for 20 min and washed with FACS buffer twice. The percentage of positive
cells was quantified using FACS Canto II and the data were analyzed with FlowJo. The S protein
variants used here are: WH01 spike: original S protein; D614G: D614G; B.1.1.7: 69-70 deletion, 144
deletion, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H; B.1.351: L18F, D80A, D215G,
242-244 deletion, R246I, K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G and A701V35.
Affinity and avidity determination using Octet (bio-layer interferometry). Fab fragment was
prepared by using Pierce Fab Micro Preparation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 250 μg m31A7 IgG was digested by incubating with
immobilized papain resin at 37℃ for 8 h. Fab was then purified by protein A column. Purified
m31A7 IgG or Fab fragments were loaded at 10 or 6.7 μg/ml in kinetics buffer (0.01% endotoxinfree BSA, 0.002% Tween-20, 0.005% NaN3 in PBS) onto Protein G or FAB2G biosensors (Molecular
Devices, ForteBio), respectively. Association and dissociation of S protein or RBD, both from WH01,
with IgG or Fab was performed in kinetics buffer at indicated concentration for 5 min and 15 min,
respectively. Kd values were calculated using a 1:1 global fit model (Octet).
Statistical analysis. All of the data are expressed as the means ± standard errors of the means. For all
