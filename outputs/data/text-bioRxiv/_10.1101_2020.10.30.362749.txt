Abstract
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in renin-angiotensin system regulation
and amino acid homeostasis. Human ACE2 acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is also widely expressed in
epithelial cells of lungs, heart, kidney and pancreas. It is considered an important drug target for
treating SARS-CoV-2, as well as pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension, renal diseases
and diabetes. Despite the critical importance, the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2
receptor remains unknown. Here, we address this challenge through all-atom simulations using a
novel ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) method. Microsecond LiGaMD
simulations have successfully captured both binding and unbinding of the MLN-4760 inhibitor in
the ACE2 receptor. In the ligand unbound state, the ACE2 receptor samples distinct Open, Partially
Open and Closed conformations. Ligand binding biases the receptor conformational ensemble
towards the Closed state. The LiGaMD simulations thus suggest a conformational selection
mechanism for ligand recognition by the ACE2 receptor. Our simulation findings are expected to
facilitate rational drug design of ACE2 against coronaviruses and other related human diseases.

Keywords: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), coronaviruses, ligand binding, ligand

Introduction
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in renin-angiotensin system regulation
and amino acid homeostasis (Gheblawi et al., 2020;Gross et al., 2020). Human ACE2 acts as the
receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
ACE2 plays a vital role as a catalytic protease converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7 and
angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9. Proteolytic reactions of these peptide hormones aid in the
conversion of vasoconstrictors to vasodilators and thus help to maintain blood pressure (Gross et
al., 2020). Likewise, ACE2 is widely expressed in epithelial cells of lungs, heart, kidney, and
pancreas. It is an important drug target for treating pulmonary diseases, heart failure, hypertension,
renal diseases and diabetes (Patel et al., 2016;Yan et al., 2020). ACE2 also stabilizes amino acid
transporter B°AT1 to regulate the gut microbiome and amino acid homeostasis (Perlot and
Penninger, 2013).
Human ACE2 has been identified as the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020). SARSCoV-2 is responsible for 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). By mid-October 2020, ~40
million people have been infected by COVID-19 with ~1.1 million deaths around the world. With
the unprecedented pandemic, it is of paramount importance to investigate virus infection and
develop effective treatments of SARS-CoV-2. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by
interaction of the receptor binding domain (RBD) in the virus spike protein S1 subunit with the
host ACE2 receptor. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) promotes priming of the
spike protein and facilitates its S2 subunit to initiate the viral-cell membrane fusion. Hence,
inhibiting the interaction between the viral RBD and host ACE2 presents a promising strategy for
blocking SAR-COV-2 entry to the human cells.

ACE2 consists of the N-terminal catalytic peptidase domain (PD) on the extracellular side
and the C-terminal transmembrane collectrin-like domain (CLD) with a cytoplasmic tail on the
intracellular side. The enzyme PD domain can be inhibited by compounds like MLN-4760 (Towler
et al., 2004), which bind to the protein active site and prevent substrate binding. MLN-4760
binding biases the receptor to adopt a “Closed” conformation, in which the protein active site
formed by two subdomains of the PD is closed from the external environment (Figure 1A).
Furthermore, the receptor undergoes conformational changes with hinge-bending movement of the
dynamic N-terminal subdomain I relative to the stable subdomain II, e.g., ~16° bending upon
inhibitor binding (Towler et al., 2004). In the absence of ligand binding, the two subdomains move
apart from each other and the protein active site becomes exposed to solvent in an “Open”
conformation (Figure 1A). In complex with RBD of the SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, the ACE2
receptor also adopts a “Partially Open” conformation, in which the subdomain I lies between the
“Open” and “Closed” conformations (Gross et al., 2020) (Figure 1A). Among over 20
experimental structures of the ACE2 receptor present in Protein Data Bank (PDB), most of them
exhibit “Open” and “Partially Open” conformations but only one structure has been identified in
the “Closed” conformation (PDB: 1R4L) (Towler et al., 2004). Despite tremendous efforts to
determine these experimental structures (Huentelman et al., 2004;Towler et al., 2004;Li et al.,
2005;Hernández Prada et al., 2008;Song et al., 2018;Shang et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020;Yan et
al., 2020), the dynamics and functional mechanism of the ACE receptor are still poorly understood
(Nami et al., 2020).
MLN-4760 is a highly selective and potent (IC50: 0.44 nM) small-molecule inhibitor of the
ACE2 receptor (Dales et al., 2002). The inhibitor has two carboxylate groups contributing to -2
net charge of the molecule (Figure S1). One of the negatively charged carboxylate groups interacts

with the positively charged zinc ion, by which the ACE2 receptor functions as a metallopeptidase
enzyme. Depending on ligand or viral RBD binding, the receptor adopts different conformations,
but the pathways and mechanism of ligand binding in the ACE2 receptor remain unknown. In the
context of SARS-CoV-2 and many other medical implications, it is important to understand the
mechanism of ligand recognition by the ACE2 receptor in order to design effective drugs against
the virus.
Ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD) (Miao et al., 2020) is an
enhanced sampling computational technique that is developed to efficiently simulate both binding
and unbinding of ligand molecules. It is based on Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics
(GaMD), which works by adding a harmonic boost potential to smooth the biomolecular potential
energy surface (Miao et al., 2015). GaMD greatly reduces energy barriers and accelerates
biomolecular simulations by orders of magnitude (Miao, 2018). GaMD provides unconstrained
enhanced sampling without the requirement of pre-defined collective variables or reaction
coordinates. Moreover, because the boost potential exhibits a Gaussian distribution, biomolecular
free energy profiles can be properly recovered through cumulant expansion to the second order
(Miao et al., 2015). In LiGaMD (Miao et al., 2020), the ligand non-bonded interaction potential
energy is selectively boosted to enable ligand dissociation. Another boost potential is applied to
the remaining potential energy of the entire system in a dual-boost algorithm to facilitate ligand
rebinding. LiGaMD has been demonstrated on host-guest and protein-ligand binding model
systems. LiGaMD allows us to capture repetitive ligand binding and unbinding, and thus
characterize both ligand thermodynamics and kinetics simultaneously. The calculated ligand
binding free energy and kinetic rate constants compared very well with experimental data (Miao
et al., 2020).

Here, we have applied all-atom LiGaMD simulations to investigate binding and unbinding
of the MLN-4760 inhibitor and associated conformational changes of the ACE2 receptor.
Microsecond LiGaMD simulations were able to capture both ligand binding and unbinding. The
ACE2 receptor sampled Open, Partially Open and Closed conformational states, being consistent
with previous experimental structures. Ligand binding could bias the receptor conformational
ensemble to the Closed state, suggesting a conformational selection mechanism rather than
induced fit. In summary, the LiGaMD simulations allowed us to understand the mechanism of
ligand recognition by the ACE2 receptor.

Materials and Methods
Ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD)
LiGaMD is an enhanced sampling computational technique that is developed to efficiently
simulate ligand binding and unbinding based on the previous GaMD (Miao et al., 2015). Details
of the LiGaMD method has been described in the previous study (Miao et al., 2020). A brief
summary will be provided here.
We consider a system of ligand L binding to a protein P in a biological environment E. The
system comprises of N atoms with their coordinates 𝑟 ≡ {𝑟⃑! , ⋯ , 𝑟⃑" } and momenta 𝑝 ≡
{𝑝⃑! , ⋯ , 𝑝⃑" } . The system Hamiltonian can be expressed as:
𝐻(𝑟, 𝑝) = 𝐾(𝑝) + 𝑉(𝑟),

where 𝐾(𝑝) and 𝑉(𝑟) are the system kinetic and total potential energies, respectively. Next, we
decompose the potential energy into the following terms:

energies between P-L, P-E and L-E, respectively. According to classical molecular mechanics
force fields (Cornell et al., 1996;Duan et al., 2003;Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010;Vanommeslaeghe

Next, one can add multiple ligand molecules in the solvent to facilitate ligand binding to
proteins in MD simulations (Dror et al., 2011;Miao et al., 2018). This is based on the fact that the
ligand binding rate constant kon is inversely proportional to the ligand concentration. The higher
the ligand concentration, the faster the ligand binds, provided that the ligand concentration is still
within its solubility limit. In addition to selectively boosting the bound ligand, another boost
potential could thus be applied on the unbound ligand molecules, protein and solvent to facilitate
both ligand dissociation and rebinding. The second boost potential is calculated using the total
system potential energy other than the non-bonded potential energy of the bound ligand in Eqn.

Energetic Reweighting
To calculate potential of mean force (PMF) (Roux, 1995) from LiGaMD simulations, the
probability distribution along a reaction coordinate is written as 𝑝∗ (𝐴) . Given the boost potential
∆𝑉(𝑟⃑) of each frame, 𝑝∗ (𝐴) can be reweighted to recover the canonical ensemble distribution,
𝑝(𝐴), as:

where M is the number of bins, 𝛽 = 𝑘C 𝑇 and 〈𝑒 D∆3(F⃑) 〉; is the ensemble-averaged Boltzmann
factor of ∆𝑉(𝑟⃑) for simulation frames found in the jth bin. The ensemble-averaged reweighting
factor can be approximated using cumulant expansion:

where the first two cumulants are given by

The boost potential obtained from LiGaMD simulations usually follows near-Gaussian
distribution. Cumulant expansion to the second order thus provides a good approximation for
computing the reweighting factor (Miao et al., 2014;Miao et al., 2015). The reweighted free energy
𝐹(𝐴) = −𝑘C 𝑇 ln 𝑝(𝐴) is calculated as:

Simulations of ligand binding in human ACE2 receptor
LiGaMD simulations using the dual-boost scheme were performed on ligand binding to the ACE2
receptor. The X-ray crystal structure of the MLN-4760 inhibitor-bound ACE2 (PDB: 1R4L
(Towler et al., 2004)) was used to prepare the simulation system (Figure S1). The N- and C-termini
of the peptides were capped with the acetyl (ACE) and N-methyl amide (NME) neutral groups,
respectively. The missing hydrogen atoms were added using the tleap module in AMBER (Case
et al., 2005a). The AMBER ff19SB force field (Tian et al., 2019) were used for the protein. The
MLN-4760 ligand was modeled with GAFF-2 (Case et al., 2020) force field. Atomic partial
charges of ligand were obtained through B3LYP/6-31G* quantum calculations of the electrostatic
potential, for which the charges were fitted using the antechamber program (Case et al.,
2005a;Case et al., 2005b). Each system was neutralized by adding counter ions and immersed in a
cubic TIP3P (Jorgensen et al., 1983) water box, which was extended 10 Å from the receptor
surface. A total of 10 ligand molecules (one in the X-ray bound conformation and another nine
placed randomly in the solvent) were included in the system to facilitate ligand binding. This
design was based on the fact that the ligand binding rate is inversely proportional to the ligand
concentration. The higher the ligand concentration, the faster the ligand binds, provided that the
ligand concentration is still within its solubility limit.
The built simulation system was energy minimized with 1 kcal/mol/Å2 constraints on the
heavy atoms of the protein and ligand, including the steepest descent minimization of 5,000 steps
followed by a conjugate gradient minimization of 5,000 steps. The system was then heated from 0
K to 300 K for 200 ps. It was further equilibrated using the NVT ensemble at 300K for 800 ps and
the NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 bar for 1 ns with 1 kcal/mol/Å2 constraints on the heavy atoms
of the protein and ligand, followed by 2 ns short cMD without any constraint. The LiGaMD

simulations proceeded with 14 ns short cMD to collect the potential statistics, 64 ns GaMD
equilibration after adding the boost potential and then three independent 1000 ns production runs
(Table S1). Initial testing simulations showed that when the threshold energy for applying boost
potential to the ligand non-bonded energy was set to the lower bound (i.e., E = Vmax), the bound
ligand maintained the X-ray conformation and did not dissociate. In comparison, when the
threshold energy was set to the upper bound (i.e., E = Vmin+1/k), it enabled high enough boost
potential to dissociate the ligand from the protein. In addition, boost applied not only to the ligand
non-bonded energy but also to all the bonded energies can accelerate the molecular transitions for
ligand dissociation and protein conformational change. Therefore, the threshold energy for
applying the ligand boost potential was set to the upper bound in the LiGaMD_Dual simulations.
Similarly, second boost potential was applied to the system total potential energy other than the
ligand bonded/non-bonded potential energy to provide sufficient acceleration for sampling ligand
rebinding. The threshold energy was set to the upper bound for rebinding part as well.
LiGaMD_Dual production simulation frames were saved every 0.2 ps for analysis.
The VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996) and CPPTRAJ (Roe and Cheatham, 2013) tools were
used for simulation analysis. The 2D PMF profiles were calculated through energetic reweighting
of the LiGaMD_Dual simulations using PyReweighting toolkit (Miao et al., 2014). 2D PMF
profiles of the interdomain Glu56:CA - Ser128:CA atom distance and root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of the MLN-4760 inhibitor relative to X-ray conformation were calculated to analyze
conformational changes of the protein upon ligand binding. Residues Glu56 and Ser128 lie on the
tip of a4 (subdomain I) and a6 helices (subdomain II), respectively. The bin size was set to 2.0 Å
for the atom distances. Similarly, 2D PMF profiles of the Glu56:CA - Ser128:CA atom distance
and RMSD of subdomain I relative to X-ray conformation were calculated to characterize domain

flexibility in the ACE2 receptor. The cutoff of simulation frames in one bin for 2D PMF
reweighting was set to 500. Structural clustering was performed on the LiGaMD simulations based
on the RMSD of the receptor as well as the ligand snapshots using hierarchical agglomerative
algorithm in CPPTRAJ (Roe and Cheatham, 2013). The RMSD cutoff was set to 2.0 A. The top
structural clusters were identified as the representative conformations of the receptor and ligand
corresponding to low-energy states in the PMF profiles.

Results
Atomic trajectores were obtained from LiGaMD simulations on the MLN-4760 inhibitor-bound
ACE2 receptor (PDB: 1R4L) (Towler et al., 2004) (Figure 1). During the LiGaMD equlibration,
the bound ligand dissociated from the active site to the bulk solvent, accompanied by large
conformational changes of the protein subdomain I (Figure S2). Upon ligand dissociation,
subdomain I of the receptor changed from the “Closed” to “Open” conformation. Three
independent 1000 ns LiGaMD production runs were further performed with randomized intitial
atomic velocities after the equilbration simulation.
During one of the three 1000 ns LiGaMD production simulations (“Sim 2” in Table S1),
the MLN-4760 inhibitor bound to the active site of the ACE2 receptor during ~100-500 ns (Figure
1B), while no ligand binding was observed in the other two simulations (Figure S3). In “Sim 2”,
RMSD of the ligand relative to the 1R4L X-ray structure reached a minimum of ~0.99 Å near ~420
ns (Figure 1B). The ligand then dissociated at ~500 ns into the bulk solvent and stayed unbound
during the remainder of the 1000 ns LiGaMD simulation. Meanwhile, the receptor underwent
large-scale conformational changes and sampled different conformations inlcuding the “Open”,

“Partially Open” and “Closed” (Figure 1A), which were consistent with the receptor experimental
structures.

LiGaMD simulations captured both ligand binding and dissociation of ACE2
During the “Sim 2” LiGaMD trajectory, starting from the bulk solvent, one of the MLN-4760
inhibitor molecules first attached to the interface between the receptor 310 H4 and a5 helices within
~100 ns, moved up into the space between the two protein subdomains and entered the active site
of the ACE2 receptor between ~100-160 ns (Figure 1C). The ligand bound at the active site of the
receptor during ~100-500 ns. At ~500 ns, the ligand dissociated from the active site to bulk solvent
(Figure 1D). The dissociation pathway was observed to be different from that of binding. Ligand
dissociated from the opening between the receptor α2 and α4 helices as the subdomain I
transitioned from “Closed” to “Open” conformation (Figure 1D). On the other hand, the ligand
bound through the space just above the 310 H4 and a5 helices (Figure 1C). During ligand binding
and dissociation in the “Sim 2” LiGaMD trajectory, subdomain I of the receptor sampled different
conformations. However, such conformational changes were also observed in other two
simulations (“Sim1” and “Sim 2”) regardless of ligand binding/dissociation (Figure S4).

Free energy profiles of ligand binding in the human ACE2 receptor
A 2D potential of mean force (PMF) free energy profile was calculated with the ligand RMSD
relative to X-ray conformation and the interdomain distance by combining the three independent
1000 ns LiGaMD production trajectories (Figures 2A). Six low-energy conformational states of
the receptor were identified from the PMF profile, including the “Bound (B)”, “Intermediate-1 (I13

1)”, “Intermediate-2 (I-2)”, “Intermediate-3 (I-3)”, “Unbound-1 (U-1)” and “Unbound-2 (U-2)”.
Particularly, the system adopted the “Bound” state with ligand RMSD < 5 Å, the “Unbound” state
with ligand RMSD > 35 Å and intermediatestates with 5 – 35 Å ligand RMSD relative to the 1R4L
X-ray structure.
In the “Bound” state, the ligand bound at the protein active site and the protein interdomain
distance was ~14 Å. The ligand exhibited a minimum RMSD of 0.99 Å compared with the X-ray
structure (Figures 2A and 2B). The system sampled three different intermediate states during
ligand binding, i.e., “Intermediate-1 (I-1)”, “Intermediate-2 (I-2)” and “Intermediate-3 (I-3)”. In
the I-1 state, the ligand RMSD was ~9.6 Å and the interdomain distance was ~18-20 Å (Figures
2A and 2C). The ligand was located near the active site making interactions with residues of the
a4 helix, a5 helix, a11 helix, 310H8 helix, b4-b5 loop, and a8-310H4 loop in the two protein
subdomains. In the “I-2” state, the ligand RMSD was ~32.1 Å and the interdomain distance was
~12 Å (Figures 2A and 2C). The ligand interacted with the a2 helix of subdomain I and the a4
helix of subdomain II in the receptor. In the “I-3” state, the ligand RMSD was ~29.6 Å and the
interdomain distance was ~23 Å (Figures 2A and 2C). The ligand interacted with the a8 helix,
a20 helix, a8-b3 loop, and the C-terminal loop after the a20 helix in the protein subdomain II
(Figure 2C). The system sampled two “Unbound (U-1)” and “Unbound (U-2)” states, where the
ligand RMSD was ~60-70 Å and the interdomain distances were ~12 Å and ~23 Å, respectively.
In these states, the ligand was found far away from the receptor in the bulk solvent and the receptor
could change between the “Closed” and “Open” conformations (Figures 2A and 2D).

Low-energy intermediate conformational states “I-1”, “I-2” and “I-3” of the MLN-4760 inhibitor
binding to the human ACE2 receptor identified from the LiGaMD simulation free energy profiles
are shown in Figures 3A, 3B and 3C, respectively. Polar and charged groups present in different
parts of the receptor made favorable interactions with the charged carboxylate groups and the polar
chloride and nitrogen atoms in the ligand molecule. These interactions played important role in
recognition and binding of the MLN-4760 inhibitor to the receptor.
In the intermediate “I-1” state, the receptor adopted a “Partially Open” conformation with
~18 Å interdomain distance. The ligand molecule was located near the recetpor active site with
~9.6 Å RMSD relative to the X-ray structure and formed interactions with residues from both
subdomains of ACE2. One of the ligand carboxylate groups formed ionic interaction with the
positively charged protein residue His345 (Figure 3A). The carboxylate group also interacted with
protein residue Thr371. Similary, one of the nitrogen atoms in the ligand’s central ring formed
ionic interaction with the negatively charged protein residue Glu145. The ligand chloride group
formed polar interactions with protein reisude Asn149.
In the intermediate “I-2” state, the receptor adopted the “Closed” conformation and the
ligand interacted with the a2 helix of subdomain I and the a4 helix of subdomain II in the receptor
(Figure 3B). One of the ligand chloride atoms formed polar interactions with protein residues
Gln60 and Asn63, while the other chloride atom formed polar interactions with protein residues
Thr118 and Asn121. One of the ligand’s negatively charged carboxylate groups formed ionic
interaction with the protein postively charged residue Lys114. The ligand terminal benzene ring
formed hydrohpobic interactions with protein residue Val59 (Figure 3B).
In the intermediate “I-3” state, one of the ligand chloride atoms formed polar interactions
with protein residues Arg245, Ser602 and Met249 of subdomain II (Figure 3C). One of the ligand

charged caroxylate groups formed polar interactions with protein residue Asn601. The ligand
terminal benzene ring formed hydrohpobic interactions with Pro258 in the receptor.
During one of the LiGaMD trajectories (“Sim3”), the MLN-4760 ligand was observed to
interact with residue Gly354 of the ACE2 receptor (Figure S5). The ligand terminal methyl group
was able to form close hydrophobic interactions with the Gly354 residue in subdomain I of the
ACE2 receptor. Notably, residue Gly354 is considered an important residue making direct
interactions with the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 as seen in the experimental structures
(Wang et al., 2020).

Conformational plasticity of human ACE2 receptor
In the LiGaMD simulations, while the protein subdomain II was stable maintaining the 1R4L Xray conformation with ~2-4 Å RMSD (Figures S2 and 4B), subdomain I in the human ACE2
receptor exhibited high flexibility and underwent large conformational changes with ~3-10 Å
RMSD compared with the X-ray conformation (Figure 4A). We calculated 2D PMF regarding the
interdomain distance and subdomain I RMSD relative to the 1R4L X-ray conformation. Three
low-energy conformational states were identified in the PMF profile, including the “Open”,
“Partially Open” and “Closed” (Figure 3C).
In the “Closed” conformation, subdomain I moved near subdomain II closing the acitve
site. The receptor interdomain distance was ~14 Å and RMSD of subdomain I was ~4 Å compared
with the 1R4L X-ray structure (Figure 3C). In the “Partially Open” conformation, the receptor
interdomain distance increased to ~18 Å and RMSD of subdomain I was ~4 Å compared with the
1R4L X-ray structure (Figure 3C). Finally, the receptor interdomain distance could increase

further to ~20 Å and the subdomain I RMSD relative to the 1R4L X-ray structure increased to ~6
Å in the “Open” conformation. Notably, conformations of the ACE2 receptor in the “Partially
Open” and “Open” low-energy states were closely similar to the experimental 6ACK cryo-EM and
6LZG X-ray structures, respectively (Figure 3C). Therefore, the different low-energy states of
ACE2 receptor revealed from our LiGaMD simulations highlighted the receptor conformational
plasticity during its function for ligand binding and interactions with other proteins (e.g., the
coronavirus spike protein).

Discussion
Since its discovery in 2000 (Donoghue et al., 2000), the ACE2 receptor has been recognized as a
critical protease enzyme with multiple physiological roles in renin-angiotensin system, amino acid
transport, gut microbiome ecology and innate immunity. The ACE2 receptor has also been
identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The COVID-19 pandemic
caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been recognized as a serious global health threat as it has no proper
treatment and continues to spread across the world. With the infection cases rising daily, it is
critical to develop therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have applied all-atom simulations
using a novel LiGaMD method to investigate the mechanism of ligand binding to the human ACE2
receptor.
Through LiGaMD enhanced sampling simulations, we have, for the first time, successfully
captured both binding and dissociation of a ligand in the human ACE2 receptor. During the
simulations, the receptor could sample distinct conformational states, revealing remarkable
conformational plasticity of the receptor. Ligand binding biased the receptor conformational

ensemble to the Closed state, suggesting a conformational selection mechanism rather than
induced fit. Furthermore, the MLN-4760 ligand molecule with -2 net charge, formed polar
interactions with charged and polar residues in the low energy intermediate states. This finding
suggested that electrostatic interactions played an important role in the recognition and
binding/dissociation of the MLN-4760 inhibitor to the ACE2 receptor, being consistent with
previous findings of “electrostatic steering” in recognition of charged ligands by proteins (Wade
et al., 1998;Miao et al., 2020).
Despite our encouraging simulation findings, it is important to note that the number of
ligand binding and unbinding events captured in the presented LiGaMD simulations was too small
and the simulation free energy profiles were not converged. More sufficient sampling would be
needed in order to obtain converged simulations and calculate the ligand binding thermodynamics
and kinetics. This can be potentially achieved through additional and longer simulations, as well
as further method developments combining LiGaMD with other enhanced sampling algorithms
such as replica exchange (Huang et al., 2018;Oshima et al., 2019) and Markov state models
(Plattner and Noe, 2015).
In this context, the MLN-4760 inhibitor binds to the human ACE2 receptor with high
affinity (IC50: 0.44 nM) (Towler et al., 2004). It is extremely difficult to simulate the ligand
dissociation and binding with long-timescale cMD and even the enhanced sampling methods. Very
few computational studies have been carried out on ligand binding to the ACE2 receptor. A recent
study (Nami et al., 2020) showed that the MLN-4760 ligand could dissociate from the ACE2
receptor upon binding of the viral RBD. However, this study was not able to characterize ligand
binding to the ACE2 receptor. In comparison, our LiGaMD simulations could capture both ligand
binding and dissociation in the human ACE2 receptor.

In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, RBD of the viral spike protein attaches to the top region
of subdomain I in the ACE2 receptor, which is distant from the receptor peptidase active site. Thus,
the MLN-4760 inhibitor does not compete directly with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. However, there
have been evidences of allosteric signaling between the RBD binding site and active site in the
ACE2 receptor. Huentelman et. al. (Huentelman et al., 2004) performed in silico molecular
docking studies to identify a novel ACE2 inhibitor that could also block SARS-CoV spike proteinmediated receptor attachment. Our LiGaMD simulations further highlighted the dynamic nature
of the receptor in terms of the large-scale movement of subdomain I and ligand binding. Similarly,
LiGaMD simulations showed that MLN-4760 could form hydrophobic interactions with RBD
binding site in subdomain I of the receptor. This information could be helpful in designing drugs
that could block RBD binding to the receptor. Likewise, since the human ACE2 receptor shows
conformational selection for ligand binding, virtual screening using ensemble docking(Lin et al.,
2002;Amaro et al., 2008;Amaro et al., 2018) with receptor structural ensembles generated from
the LiGaMD simulations will be a promising approach to designing potent drug molecules of the
ACE2 receptor.
In summary, we have successfully simulated both ligand binding and dissociation in the
human ACE2 receptor using the novel LiGaMD enhanced sampling method. During the LiGaMD
simulations, the receptor could sample distinct Closed, Partially Open and Open conformational
states. Ligand binding biased the receptor towards the Closed conformation, suggesting a
conformational selection mechanism. Our simulation findings are expected to facilitate rational
drug design targeting ACE2 for the therapeutic treatments of COVID-19 and other related human
diseases.

Figure 3. (A) The “Intermediate-1 (I-1)” conformational state of the MLN-4760 ligand (blue balls
and sticks) bound to the ACE2 receptor (ribbons). Residues of subdomain I (blue) and subdomain
II (gray) including H345, T371, E145 and N149 formed polar interactions with the ligand. (B) The
“Intermediate-2 (I-2)” conformational state of MLN-4760 (yellow) bound to the ACE2 receptor
(ribbons). Residues of subdomain I (yellow) and subdomain II (gray) including Q60, N63, N171
and N121 formed polar interactions with the ligand. (C) The “Intermediate-3 (I-3)” conformational
state of MLN-4760 (pink) bound to the ACE2 receptor (ribbons). Residues of subdomain I (pink)
and subdomain II (gray) including R245, M249, S602 and N601 formed polar interactions with
the ligand.
Figure 4. RMSDs of (A) subdomain I and (B) subdomain II of the ACE2 receptor relative to the
closed X-ray conformation (PDB:1R4L) are calculated from three independent LiGaMD
production simulations. (C) 2D potential of mean force (PMF) of the subdomain I RMSD and
interdomain distance calculated by combining the three LiGaMD simulations. Three low energy
conformational states of the receptor are identified in the PMF profile, including the “Closed”,
“Partially Open” and “Open”, which are similar to the 6LZG, 6ACK and 1R4L PDB structures,
respectively. (D) Low-energy conformations of the ACE2 receptor with subdomain I found in the
“Open” (red), “Partially Open” (blue) and “Closed” (green) states in the LiGaMD simulations.
Subdomain II is stable and colored in gray.
