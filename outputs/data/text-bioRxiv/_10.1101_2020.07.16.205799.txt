Running title: Incorporation of nucleotide analogs by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp

21

Abstract

22
23

Nucleotide analogs targeting viral RNA polymerase have been approved to be an effective

24

strategy for antiviral treatment and are attracting antiviral drugs to combat the current SARS-

25

CoV-2 pandemic. In this report, we develop a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension

26

assay to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by SARS-CoV-2 RNA-

27

dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) quantitively. Our results show that many nucleotide analogs

28

can be incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and that the incorporation of some of

29

them leads to chain termination. The discrimination values of nucleotide analog over those of

30

natural nucleotide were measured to evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by

31

RdRp. We found that the incorporation efficiency of Remdesivir-TP is higher than ATP, and we

32

did not observe chain termination or delayed chain termination caused by single Remdesivir-TP

33

incorporation, while multiple incorporations of Remdesivir-TP caused chain termination in our

34

assay condition. The incorporation efficiency of Ribavirin-TP and Favipiravir-TP is very low

35

either as ATP or GTP analogs, which suggested that mutagenesis may not be the mechanism of

36

action of those two drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Incorporation of Sofosbuvir-TP is also very low

37

suggesting that sofosbuvir may not be very effective in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a

38

comparison, 2’-C-Methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA efficiently, and the derivative of

39

2’-C-Methyl-GTP may have therapeutic application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. This

40

report provides a simple screening method that should be useful in evaluating nucleotide-based

41

drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and for studying the mechanism of action of selected

42

nucleotide analog.

Introduction

46
47

An ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was caused by severe

48

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1-3), which is single-stranded,

49

positive-sense RNA virus and has the largest genomes (around 30kb) known among RNA virus

50

(4). Right now, SARS-CoV-2 is continuing its spread across the world, and currently, no

51

effective vaccines are available, thus the search for safe and effective small-molecule inhibitors

52

that would be active against SARS-CoV-2 represents a high research priority.

53

Nucleoside/nucleotide-based inhibitors targeting viral DNA or RNA polymerase have been

54

proven to be the backbone of antiviral therapies (5, 6). Currently, there are over 25 approved

55

therapeutic nucleosides/nucleotides used for the therapy of various viral infections of high

56

medical importance, such as HIV (tenofovir, AZT, et al), hepatitis B (lamivudine), hepatitis C

57

(sofosbuvir), or herpes infection (acyclovir). The proven success in using nucleoside-based drugs

58

to effectively treat viral infections and the current knowledge of the development pathway for

59

developing this class of inhibitors makes them attractive antiviral agents to combat the current

60

pandemic of COVID-19 (7-9).

61

Following the intracellular phosphorylation, nucleotide analog 5’-triphosphates (the active form

62

of nucleoside analogs) are competitively incorporated into nascent viral RNA chains and thus

63

inhibit viral replication (5). The mechanism of action varies for different nucleotide analogs. The

64

most common mechanism of action is chain termination caused by the incorporation of

65

nucleotide analogs resulting in the formation of incomplete viral RNA chains (10, 11). Non-chain

66

terminators may also be used as antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin and Favipiravir which could

67

induce mutagenesis due to their ambiguous base-pairing properties after incorporated into viral

68

RNA (12-17).

69

Like other Coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes an RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp)

70

on the nsp12 gene (4). This protein, which catalyzes RNA synthesis, forms a replication complex

71

with nsp7, nsp8, and other virally encoded proteins and host proteins that are responsible for

72

mRNA synthesis, as well as the synthesis of genomic RNA for progeny viruses (8). The structure

73

of the nsp12-nsp8-nsp7 complex was recently determined using cryo-EM (18). Additionally,

74

unlike other viruses, SARS-CoV-2 encodes an exonuclease gene (nsp14) and can perform

75

proofreading activity to remove the mismatched nucleotides from viral RNA (19, 20). This

76

probably is one of the difficulties to develop nucleotide polymerase inhibitors against SARS-

77

CoV-2 and this proofreading activity of SARS-CoV-2 should be taken into consideration when

78

developing a nucleoside-based antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2. Nucleotide analogs with

79

different mechanisms of action (chain terminator versus non-chain terminator) may respond

80

differently to SARS-CoV-2 proofreading activity mediated by nsp14. So far, numerous

81

nucleoside/nucleotide analogs have been described to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 including Remdesivir,

82

Ribavirin, BCX4430, Gemcitabine hydrochloride, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine and 6-Azauridine (7).

83

The detailed mechanism of action of those nucleotide analogs against SARS-CoV-2 still needs to

84

be addressed.

85

In this report, we developed a robust in vitro nonradioactive primer extension assay using a

86

fluorescently labeled RNA primer annealed to an RNA template. The incorporation efficiency

87

and chain termination ability of a series of nucleotide analogs were determined using this assay.

88

The method is very valuable for evaluation of the antiviral potential of nucleotide analogs and the

89

structure-activity information derived from these studies can be used to explore the mechanism of

90

action of given nucleotide inhibitors, and design nucleotide analogs with better properties.

Analysis of chain termination ability of nucleotide analogs. The primer extension reactions

162

were performed as described above. Incorporation and chain termination of tested nucleotides

were measured in two separate assays. Nucleotide analog incorporation assay: P/Ts (5 nM) and

164

nsp12-nsp8-nsp7 complex (RdRp) (50 nM nsp12, 2 µM nsp8-7) were incubated with a natural

Results

188

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8. Numbers of reports have

189

shown that functional SARS-CoV-2 nsp12-nsp8-nsp7 complex (RdRp) can be expressed and

190

purified from insect cells (23). In this report, nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 were successfully expressed

191

and purified from E. coli (Fig. 1), and the functional nsp12-nap8-nsp7 complex was assembled

192

by simply mixing nsp12, nsp7 and nsp8 together in vitro. Nsp12 was expressed as C-terminal

193

His-tagged protein and purified according to the published papers with modification (18, 24).

194

Nsp7 and nsp8 were expressed as N-terminal His-tagged protein and protein purification was

195

performed using Nickel agarose resin. It was reported that pre-formed nsp7 and nsp8 complex

196

has better ability to promote nsp12 polymerase activity (25), copurification of nsp7 and nsp8 was

197

also performed by simply mixing cells expressing nsp8 and nsp7 before lysing cells, which will

198

allow nsp7 and nsp8 to form a stable complex during purification. Nsp8-7 was used to represent

199

copurified nsp8 and nsp7 in this report. After purification, the identity of the purified proteins

200

was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown).

203

RNA corresponding to the sequence of 3’-end of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome) and a

204

fluorescently labeled RNA primer (30-mer) was developed (Fig. 2A). The detail of the RNA

205

primer extension method was described previously (21, 22, 26). It was reported that nsp7 and

206

nsp8 could form a complex with nsp12, which is essential for RNA synthesis catalyzed by nsp12.

207

In this experiment, different combinations of purified protein (nsp12, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp8-7)

208

were used in the primer extension assay to test the RNA synthesis ability of different

209

combinations (Fig. 2B). The result showed that nsp12, nsp7, or nsp8 alone did not have any

210

measured RNA synthesis ability in the reaction condition described in this experiment (Fig. 2B,

211

lane 2, 3, and 6). Nsp12 and nsp7 together also did not have RNA polymerase activity (Fig. 2B,

212

lane 8), and nsp12 and nsp8 together had weak RNA polymerase activity (Fig. 2B, lane 9).

213

Maximum polymerase activity was observed in the presence of nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7 together

214

(Fig. 2B, lane 10, 11). An active-site mutation (SDDSAA) of nsp12 (Nsp12mut) showed no

215

RNA synthesis in the presence of nsp8 and nsp7, which confirm that RNA synthesis is mediated

216

by nsp12. The ability of nsp8-7 to promote nsp12 polymerase was further evaluated through an

217

enzyme dilution assay and compared with that of separately added nsp8 and nsp7 (Fig. 2C). The

218

result showed that nsp8-7 had a better ability to promote nsp12 catalyzed RNA synthesis. Nsp8-7

219

was used in the following primer extension assays described in the report and nsp8 concentration

220

in nsp8-7 was used to represent the concentration of nsp8-7.

Primer extension assay development and optimization. It has been shown that the

RNA primers (Primer I, Primer II and Primer III) complementary to different regions of 3’-end of

226

RNA synthesis by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp using three P/Ts was tested in a primer extension assay

227

with a serious dilution of nsp12 and a constant concentration of nsp8-7 (Fig. 3B). The result

228

showed that the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp prefers longer primer (Primer III, 30mer) annealing with the

229

RNA template. As a comparison, the efficiency of RNA synthesis using three P/Ts by dengue

230

RdRp was similar (data not shown). Primer III (30-mer) shown in Fig. 3A was used in the

231

following primer extension assays.

232

To develop a robust polymerase assay, an optimal nsp8-nsp7 and nsp12 concentrations used in

233

the reaction should be carefully determined. An enzyme dilution assay with different

234

concentrations of nsp8-7 and nsp12 was performed (Fig. 4). The concentration of nsp8 was used

235

to represent the concentration of co-purified nsp8-nsp7. The result showed that the primer

236

extension products correlated with the concentration of nsp12 (Fig. 4C) and a higher

237

concentration of nsp8-7 had better ability to promote nsp12 polymerase activity (Fig. 4D). In the

238

following primer extension assays, 50 nM nsp12 and 2 µM nsp8-7 (2 µM nsp8 and 10 µM nsp7)

239

were used. Under this assay condition, RNA primer (5nM) can be extended completely while

240

consuming less nsp12 enzyme.

241

Nucleotide incorporation and chain termination. To inhibit viral RNA synthesis or disrupt

242

viral RNA function, a nucleotide analog must be incorporated into newly synthesized viral RNA

243

by RNA polymerase. Several different nucleotide analogs (Fig. 5) that have been used as antiviral

244

drugs or in the various applications were selected, and the utilization of those nucleotide analogs

245

by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and the ability of those analogs to cause chain termination (one of the

246

designed for testing ATP analog as such that the first nucleotide to be incorporated is UTP and

250

ATP or ATP analogs as the second nucleotide to be incorporated (Fig. 6A). The result showed

251

that all the nucleotide analogs tested in this assay can be incorporated into RNA as ATP analogs

252

at 100 µM (Fig. 6B. lane 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15). Longer band in lane 5, 11, 13, 15 than the band in

253

lane 3 shown in Fig. 6B suggested that 6-Chloropurine-TP, Remdesivir-TP, Ribavirin-TP, and

254

Favipiravir-TP can also be incorporated as GTP (the third nucleotide to be incorporated) in this

255

assay. After adding GTP and CTP (third and fourth nucleotide to be incorporated), if

256

incorporation of a nucleotide analog can lead to chain termination, the band will not be extended

257

(for example, comparing lane 9 and lane 10 in Fig. 6B), otherwise, it will be extended (for

258

example, comparing lane 3 and lane 4 in Fig. 6B). The result showed that the incorporation of

259

Tenofovir-DP caused chain termination (Fig. 6B, lane 10), and incorporation of 6-Choropurine-

260

TP, Clofarabine-TP, Remdesivir-TP, Ribavirin-TP, and Favipiravir-TP did not cause chain

261

termination (Fig. 6B, lane 6, 8, 12, 14, 16). In Fig. 6B, product in lane 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16 are

262

shorter than the product shown in lane 4 (40-mer full-length product), which is probably because

263

multiple ATP analog incorporations caused chain termination at various places.

immediate chain termination (Fig. 6D, lane 10); incorporation of 6-Methylthio-GTP, 6-Thio-GTP,

8-Oxo-GTP, Remdesivir-TP, Ribavirin-TP, and Favipiravir-TP did not cause chain termination

Incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analogs by RdRp. The relative incorporation efficiency

282

of nucleotide analogs versus natural nucleotide (discrimination value) by viral RNA-dependent

283

RNA polymerase has been used to evaluate the antiviral potential of nucleotide analogs targeting

284

Zika virus and dengue virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (21), and it also has been used to

285

evaluate potential mitochondrial toxicity of nucleotide analogs in a primer extension assay by

286

mitochondrial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (22). Using a similar method, the

287

discrimination values of nucleotide analogs, measured in the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp primer

288

extension assay developed in this study, were employed to evaluate the relative incorporation

289

efficiency of nucleotide analogs by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. An initial time-course experiment

290

showed that the incorporation of natural rNTPs by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very fast (data not

291

shown) and RNA synthesis was finished within 1 min after adding rNTP (100 µM). To get a

292

quantitative measurement of K1/2 value (nucleotide concentration resulting in 50% product

293

extension), a short reaction time (20 s) after adding different nucleotide analogs were used. Fig.

295

analogs (Remdesivir-TP and 6-Chloropurine-TP). The measured values of K1/2 (the nucleotide

296

concentration at which half of the 31-mer product is extended to the 32-mer product) for ATP

297

(K1/2, ATP), Remdesivir-TP (K1/2, Remdesivir-TP) and 6-Chloropurine-TP (K1/2, 6-Chloropurine-TP) were

298

0.04167 µM, 0.03305 µM, and 3.351 µM respectively, and the calculated discrimination values

299

for DRemdesivir-TP and D6-Chloropurine-TP were 0.79 and 80, respectively (Fig. 7C). This result

300

suggested that Remdesivir-TP was incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp more

301

efficiently than natural ATP. The incorporation efficiency of other ATP analogs by SARS-CoV-

302

2 RdRp was much lower than that of ATP. To get a quantitative measurement of K1/2 values, a

303

longer reaction time (15 min) is needed to increase the percentage of incorporation of nucleotide

304

analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Since the K1/2 of natural ATP is impossible to measure directly

305

under such conditions (it is below the limit of sensitivity of the assay), the K1/2 value of 6-

306

Chloropurine-TP was used as a surrogate comparator. A similar strategy has been used to

307

evaluate the incorporation efficiency of nucleotide analog by mitochondrial DNA-dependent

308

RNA polymerase (22). Fig. 7D-E shows the testing of ATP analogs and discrimination value

309

calculation. In this assay, the K1/2 values of several ATP analogs were measured and compared to

310

the K1/2 value of 6-Chloropurine-TP, which was used as a reference to calculate the D*ATP analog

311

value (where D*ATP analog = K1/2, ATP analog/K1/2, 6-Chloropurine-TP). The discrimination values of the

312

different ATP analogs are summarized in Table 1. Dcal is a calculated discrimination value

313

obtained using the equation Dcal ATP analog = D*ATP analog × D6-Chloropurine. Dcal represents the

314

discrimination of incorporation by RdRp between natural ATP and a tested ATP analog. Mis-

315

incorporation of GTP base-pairing with uridine in the template was also measured, which can be

316

used as a guideline to evaluate the possibility of nucleotide analogs incorporation in the cell. If

317

the incorporation efficiency of an ATP analog is lower than GTP misincorporation efficiency, it

318

probably has less chance to be incorporated in the cell, unless very high intracellular nucleotide

319

analogs concentration can be reached. As shown in Table 1, Dcal values for Remdesivir-TP, 6-

320

Chloropurine-TP, Clofarabine-TP, Ribavirin-TP, Favipiravir-TP, Tenofovir-DT and GTP were

321

0.78 ± 0.02, 78.0 ± 3.5, >112242, 24999 ± 828, 7343 ± 752, >112242 and 8683 ± 600,

322

respectively. Based on comparison with DcalGTP (natural GTP misincorporation as ATP),

323

Remdesivir-TP, 6-Chloropurine-TP can be incorporated into RNA very efficiently by RdRp;

324

Ribavirin-TP and Favipiravir-TP showed less possibility to be incorporated into RNA by RdRp.

325

Only a small fraction of primer was extended in the condition of Clofarabine-TP and Tenofovir-

326

DP in the primer extension condition used in this assay, which suggested that the incorporation

327

efficiency of those two nucleotides is very low. Using a similar strategy, several GTP analogs

328

(Fig. S1) and UTP analogs (Fig. S2) were also be tested and the data were summarized in Table 1.

329

For GTP analogs, 6-Thio-GTP and 2’-C-Methyl-GTP can be incorporated into RNA very

330

efficiently; the incorporation efficiency of 6-Methylthio-GTP, Oxo-GTP, Remdesivir-TP,

331

Ribavirin-TP, and Favipiravir-TP is lower than or close to the misincorporation of ATP base-

332

pairing with cytidine in the template, which suggested that they may not be incorporated into

333

RNA as GTP analog in the cell. For UTP analogs, 2’-Amino-UTP, 2’-Azido-UTP and ara-UTP

334

showed higher incorporation efficiency; incorporation efficiency for Stavudine-TP, 2’-O-Methyl-

335

UTP, Sofosbuvir-TP, and Ribavirin-TP was very low. Remdesivir-TP and Favipiravir-TP were

336

also tested as UTP analogs and no incorporation was observed in the condition used in this assay

(15 min incubation) (data not shown).

Influence of Remdesivir-TP incorporation to RNA synthesis. It was shown that Remdesivir-

341

incorporation during RNA synthesis was tested in primer extension assay (Fig. 8). To rule out the

342

possibility of premature RNA synthesis caused by RNA sequence variation, poly-A sequence

343

was used downstream of uridine (Remdesivir-TP incorporation site) in the template (Fig. 8A, C,

344

E, G). In this study, 4 different templates (shown on the top of each gel image in Fig. 8) were

345

used to test the influence of single, double, triple, or quadruple incorporations of Remdesivir-TP

346

to the following nucleotide incorporation. After incorporation of ATP or Remdesivir-TP,

347

different concentrations of UTP were added to test the RNA synthesis by RdRp. Comparing with

348

ATP, single incorporation of Remdesivir-TP did not lead to chain termination or delayed chain

349

termination (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, the incorporation efficiency of UTP after single Remdesivir-

350

TP incorporation was increased evidenced by a stronger 33-mer band at a low concentration of

351

UTP in the condition of Remdesivir-TP comparing with that in the condition of ATP (Fig. 8B).

352

Fig. 8C-D showed double incorporation of Remdesivir-TP also did not lead to chain termination

353

or delayed chain termination. Fig. 8E-F showed triple incorporation of Remdesivir-TP did

354

decrease the RNA synthesis efficiency after Remdesivir-TP incorporation evidenced by the 34-

355

mer band persisting at a high concentration of UTP (Fig. 8F), which suggests a partial

356

termination caused by triple incorporation of Remdesivir-TP. Fig. 8G-H showed quadruple

357

incorporation of Remdesivir-TP decreased the RNA synthesis a lot (Fig. 8H, 35-mer band),

358

which suggests a strong termination effect caused by quadruple incorporation of Remdesivir-TP.

Discussion

360

In this study, SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, nsp8, and nsp7 were successfully constructed, expressed, and

361

purified from E coli. Nsp12-nsp8-nsp7 complex (RdRp) was assembled in vitro and showed

362

robust RNA synthesis activity. Using purified RdRp, we have developed an in vitro

363

nonradioactive primer extension assay and have demonstrated that it can be used as a tool to

364

identify nucleotide analog substrates which could be developed into antiviral drugs against

365

SARS-CoV-2. The primer extension assay described in this report can also be used to develop a

366

high through-put screen assay based on the detection of PPi released from polymerase reaction to

367

identify non-nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 (21).

368

It has been shown that many nucleotide analogs currently used as antiviral drugs can be

369

incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (27, 28), which suggests that they

370

have the potential to be developed into antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2. As a competitive

371

inhibitor of RNA polymerase, a nucleotide analog must compete with natural rNTP for

372

incorporation into viral RNA. The relative incorporation efficiency of a nucleotide analog versus

373

natural rNTP (discrimination value) is an important criterion in evaluating the antiviral potential

374

of nucleotide analogs. Like other studies (23), our data showed that Remdesivir-TP can be

375

incorporated into RNA as ATP analog by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and the incorporation efficiency is

376

higher than natural ATP (DRemdesivir-TP = 0.78 ± 0.02). The incorporation efficiency of Ribavirin-

377

TP and Favipiravir-TP is very low either as ATP analog or as GTP analogs (even lower than GTP

378

or ATP mis-incorporation), which suggested that they may not be incorporated into RNA by

379

SARS-CoV2 RdRp in the cell unless the intracellular concentration of Ribavirin-TP and

380

Favipiravir-TP can reach to such a high level, that they can successfully compete with natural

381

nucleotide for incorporation. Unlike their mutagenesis effect shown in influenza virus infection,

382

the mechanism of action for Ribavirin and Favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 may not be mediated

383

by RdRp and need further investigation. Sofosbuvir, an approved anti-HCV drug, has been

384

proposed to be used for treating SARS-CoV-2. Our data showed that Sofosbuvir-TP can be

385

incorporated into RNA by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, but the incorporation efficiency is very low and

386

probably it cannot compete with natural UTP for incorporation by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp in the cell.

387

Remdesivir has been used as antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 and number of studies have

388

been performed to study the antiviral mechanism of action of Remdesivir (23, 29, 30). It has been

389

shown that incorporation of Remdesivir-TP caused delayed chain termination, which in turn

390

block viral RNA synthesis. The influence of Remdesivir-TP incorporation to RNA synthesis

391

catalyzed by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was studied using primer extension assay. Our data showed

392

that single or double incorporation of Remdesivir-TP did not lead to chain termination or delayed

393

chain termination. Quadruple incorporation of Remdesivir-TP caused a strong termination, but no

394

delayed chain termination was observed. There are a few parameters that may have affected the

395

results, such as the primer/template scaffold used in different studies, template sequence

396

downstream of Remdesivir-TP incorporation and purification, and assembling method of SARS-

397

CoV-2 RdRp (nsp12-nsp8-nsp7 complex). Further mechanistic study is needed to address the

398

discrepancy between our result and those in the paper of Gordon CJ et al.

stopped by the addition of stopping solution. Chain termination ability (lane 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,
16): primer extension reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 µM UTP and 100 µM ATP
analogs, as indicated under each lane. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for 30 min, and
then 0.1 µM GTP and 0.1 µM CTP were added to the reaction mixture and the reaction were
continued at 37 °C for another 30 min before adding stopping solution. The reaction products
were resolved by denaturing PAGE. Analysis of incorporation and termination of GTP analogs,
UTP analogs, and CTP analogs were shown in panel C-D, panel E-F and panel G-H respectively
