Abstract

The susceptibility of different populations to the SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. A
deeper analysis of the genomes of individuals from different populations might explain their risk
for infection. In this study, a combined analysis of ACE2 coding variants in different populations
and computational chemistry calculations are conducted in order to probe the potential effects of
ACE2 coding variants on SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding affinity. Our study reveals novel
interaction data on the variants and SARS-CoV-2. We could show that ACE2-K26R; which is
more frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population decrease the electrostatic attraction between
SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2. On the contrary, ACE2-I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G, G211R were
found to increase the electrostatic attraction and increase the binding to SARS-CoV-2; ordered
by the strength of binding from weakest to strongest. I468V, R219C, K341R, D206G and G211R
were more frequent in East Asian, South Asian, African and African American, European and
European and South Asian populations, respectively. SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interface in the WT
protein and corresponding variants is showed to be a dominated by van der Waals (vdW)
interactions. All the mutations except K341R induce an increase in the vdW attractions between
the ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2. The largest increase of is observed for the R219C mutant.

Introduction

Despite numerous reports on the clinical manifestation of the recent novel coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), including pathogenicity, diagnosis, and recommended treatment regimes,
understanding of the mechanisms of infection, the virus-host interactions, and transmission is
still in its early stage1–4. The risk of certain populations for the infection is also still not well
understood and remains under investigation. After the identification of the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor5, a large number of reports have
emerged trying to identify the pathology of the disease, and thus provide guidance to the efforts
to design small molecules inhibitors3,5. Some recent studies attempted to probe the comorbidity
among infected patients, specifically patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary

heart diseases, and cerebrovascular disease that showed increased risk. Whether ACE2
polymorphisms linked to the aforementioned diseases or administration of ACE2 modulating
drugs have larger impact on the severity of infection is still a question to be investigated6.
Communications between the pathogen and the host is mainly governed by the different proteinprotein electrostatic interactions7,8. These proteins need to bind in a specific way for proteinprotein complexes formation and for the signals to be effectively transmitted. The existence of
residues that are involved in energetically favorable interactions at the protein-protein interface
leads to enhanced interactions leading to viral-host cells fusion, marking the onset of the
infection5,9. Therefore, we opted herein to investigate the nature of the interactions at the SARSCoV-2/ACE2 interface, and how the subtle variations in the structure of ACE2, induced by
certain mutations, can alter the binding of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations. This was
attempted here by analyzing different ACE2 missense variants that code for ACE2-K26R,
ACE2-I468V, ACE2-R219C, ACE2-K341R, ACE2-D206G, ACE2-G211R and the strength of
their interaction with the spike protein (S-protein) of SARS-COV-2 using Molecular Dynamics
and Monte Carlo Sampling, which are dominated by electrostatics. The electrostatics interactions
are the dominant factor in protein-protein interactions10, where classical treatment of these
interactions in solution are described by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE).
Our data demonstrates an increase in the strength of the binding of the variants; in the order
mentioned, with K26R showing the least favorable binding and G211R showing the most
favorable binding. We analyzed the frequencies of the alleles in different populations to identify
the population in which each variant is more frequent. Our data help in identifying variations of
appreciable frequencies and the implications for each in affecting the strength of the virusreceptor interactions in individuals of different populations.
Materials and methods:
Classical electrostatic calculations based on solving Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation is used to
investigate the interaction energies between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 for different mutated
ACE2 structures. All continuum electrostatics calculations were performed by the freely
available software “Multi-Conformer Continuum electrostatics (MCCE)”11. Where that
interaction energies are modeled by treating each residue as separate fragments with integer
charges, which are interacting with each other by means of electrostatic and Lennard-Jones
potentials11. The Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation is numerically solved by DELPHI software,
which is integrated within the MCCE code, to compute self-energies of each conformer and pairwise interaction energies between conformers and between conformers and backbone. Upon
energy calculations, the energy look-up table is built, and theoretical titration is modeled by
obtaining Boltzmann distribution of microstates, using the Monte-Carlo approach. Where that
microstates of the structures are defined depending on rotamers and protonation states of the
different amino acids. Where that the protein interior are considered as highly polar media with
low dielectric constant (   4), whereas the solvent (water) is treated as a continuum
medium with high dielectric constant (   80).
Initial coordinates are defined according to the X-ray crystal structure of the wild type (WT)
human ACE2 with the receptor-binding domain RDB of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID:

6M17) from the protein data bank5. The structure of the Neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1
was removed from the PDB file, as it is far from the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 binding site.
Furthermore, the structure of ACE2 was trimmed by removing residues from P733 to the end of
the chain. The WT residues of ACE2 at positions 26, 206, 211, 219, 341 and 468 were mutated
to Arg (R), Gly (G), Arg (R), Cys (C), Arg (R) and Val (V), respectively. The sidechains in the
WT structure was replaced with the sidechains of the mutants using MCCE (Multi Conformer
Continuum Electrostatics) (Fig. 1). A set of different conformers of the sidechains were
generated for WT and mutated structures by rotating the single bonds in the sidechains by 600
degrees. In addition, conformers were created for charged amino acids according to their
possible protonation states. Then, these conformers were subjected to Monte Carlo sampling to
obtain the Boltzmann distribution based on the electrostatic interactions, which are calculated
using DELPHI. The most occupied conformers in the generated Boltzmann distributions were
selected and subjected to molecular dynamics optimization using openMM. Finally, the
interaction energies were computed for the optimized structures using MCCE. The electrostatics
and van der Waals interactions between aminoacids in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2
were analyzed using python-based code.

Results and discussion:
In an attempt to better understand the susceptibility of different populations to infection by
SARS-CoV-2, we gathered data on ACE2 missense variants from different projects and
databases that aggregate allele frequencies (AF). These projects and databases included Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP)12,13, 1000 genomes project phase 3 (1KGP3)14,
Allele Frequency Aggregator (ALFA project)a, Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC)15,genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)b,16, GO exome sequencing project (ESP)c,
Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TopMed)17, in addition to a recent study reporting data
from the China Metabolic Analytics Project (ChinaMAP, under reviewing) and other
populations18.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to bind to human ACE2 via different ACE2 residues; Q24, D30,
H34, Y41, Q42, M82, K353 and R3575. We analyzed all ACE2 coding variants reported and
selected the variants that are close to the interaction site to test for changes in their binding
interactions to SARS-CoV-2. To focus on the most frequent variants, we did not include variants
of very low allele count in all populations. The variants we tested were K26R, D206G, G211R,
R219C, K341R and I468V. Table S1 shows the frequency of each allele in the African, African
American, American, Ashkenazi Jewish, Asian (All, ChinaMAP, East Asian, Han Chinese
South, Han Chinese Beijing and South Asian), European (All, European American, Finnish and
non-Finnish) and Latino.
Variations in ACE2 affect its interaction with SARS-CoV-2
The electrostatic and the van der Waal contribution to the interaction energies of SARS-CoV2/ACE2 were compared between single mutated and WT protein at pH =7 (Table 1). In contrary
to K26R, most of the mutated structures exhibit a negative shift in the total interaction energy
compared to the WT structure (Native) i.e. more electrostatic attraction with the spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2. Based on our calculations, G211R mutant is shown to induce the largest increase
in the binding energy between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, where the binding is more favorable by

How ACE2 variants can impact the susceptibility of different population to SARS-CoV-2
infection?
The K26R variant which decreases the ACE2-virus binding was found to be most frequent in the
Ashkenazi Jewish population (1.2%). On the contrary, the Asian population had the lowest allele
frequency for the single nucleotide variant (SNV) coding for K26R. In addition, the frequency of
I468V which enhance ACE2 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 was observed in more than 1% of the
East Asian population. Interestingly, I468V was not detected in the African, African American,
American, Ashkenazi Jewish and Latino populations and was very rare in the European
population. R219C was most frequent in the south Asian population (0.1%), but was not detected

in other Asian subpopulations and was much less frequent or lacking in other populations. The
K341R, which enhance the virus-receptor binding was most frequent in the African and African
American populations; the average of the AF reported for the populations was ~ 0.4% and ~
0.5%, respectively. Finally, the D206G and G211R, which showed the strongest interaction with
ACE2 were most abundant in the European population, mounting to 0.06% and ~ 0.2%,
respectively. The G211R was also abundant in the South Asian population ~ 0.2%.
Our findings give indications regarding the populations that could be more prone to SARS-CoV2 infection due to enhanced binding affinity. Nevertheless, the need for proper infection, death
and recovery statistics is needed to reach a definite conclusion. K26R and I468V are considered
of intermediate frequencies (>1%) in the Ashkenazi Jewish and East Asian population,
respectively. Therefore, we would refer to them as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) in
the respective populations. However, the other variants are considered of rare frequencies
(<1%)19,20. Nevertheless, in the era of Individualized Genomics, the individual differences in the
same population should also be taken into account as rare variants might exist affecting the virus
binding to ACE2 in many individuals.
The possibility of having individuals baring more than one of the mutations that enhance the
binding is also still an open question, that will be answered via sequencing of ACE2 in more
individuals of the aforementioned populations. The presence of variants for the serine protease
TMPRSS2; required for S protein priming, in different populations could also account for
differences in viral entry and pathogenesis9.
Conclusion
Our data suggests that certain populations might be more affected by SARS-CoV-2; depending
on the frequency of the respective variants. To better understand the susceptibility of individuals
from different populations to SARS-CoV-2 and their risk of infection, large scale sequencing
projects should be performed. Integrating population genetics will provide a new insight into the
mystery of susceptibility, infection, pathogenicity and mortality in different regions. Sequencing
of ACE2 in patients with the most severe conditions in every population will also provide a more
reliable conclusion. The sequencing projects will not only help us test the association between
ACE2 variants and risk/severity of infection in certain populations, it will also allow more
accurate analysis of variants for other host genes involved in the viral entry and pathogenicity21.
Finally, our findings can potentially guide future attempts to devise small molecules inhibitors,
designed specifically to disrupt the interaction between the strongest ACE2 binding variants and
the S protein of SARS-CoV-22.
