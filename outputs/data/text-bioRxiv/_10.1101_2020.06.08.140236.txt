Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a
pandemic of historic proportions and continues to spread globally, with enormous
consequences to human health. Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic or
prophylactic. Like other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 is
mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction
with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found
to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of
virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third
generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated
polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector
pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated
polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based
differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves
showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of
unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH and 6-O-desulfated
enoxaparin with an IC50 of 5.99 µg/L, 1.08 mg/L, 1.77 µg/L, and 5.86 mg/L respectively.
The low serum bioavailability of intranasally administered UFH, along with data
suggesting that the nasal epithelium is a portal for initial infection and transmission,
suggest that intranasal administration of UFH may be an effective and safe prophylactic
treatment.

Introduction

The recent emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARSCoV-2) in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world
has created a pandemic situation unprecedented in modern history 1-4. SARS-CoV-2 is a
betacoronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV, however, significant differences in the
spike glycoprotein (SGP) are present in SARS-CoV-2 that may drive differences in the
attachment and entry process. In SARS-CoV, the SGP binds to its cognate receptor,
human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The bound virus is then endocytosed
into the cell, where SGP is acted upon by the endosomal protease TMPRSS2 to allow
envelope fusion and viral entry 5.
While ACE2 has been confidently identified as the viral receptor, many viruses
(including some betacoronaviruses) will use cellular polysaccharides as cellular
attachment co-receptors, allowing the virus to adhere to the surface of the cell and
increasing the local concentration of viral particles to increase effective infection rates.
Sequence analysis of SGP of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that this virus has evolved to have
additional potential glycosaminoglycan (GAG) binding domains compared to SARS-CoV
6,7.

GAGs are a family of linear sulfated polysaccharides found on the surface of virtually

all mammalian cells, and commonly includes chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate
(HS). Previous studies using isolated SARS-CoV-2 SGP monomer or trimer and surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) have shown that SARS-CoV-2 SGP has high affinity to heparin
6,7,

a specialized member of the HS family that is highly sulfated and commonly used

clinically as an anti-coagulant drug. It was also reported that heparin was capable of
inhibiting infection of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell culture in a concentration-dependent
fashion 7. These results support a model of SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry illustrated
in Figure 1, where SARS-CoV-2 initially binds to HS in the nasal epithelium glycocalyx,
then subsequently binds hACE2 and is endocytosed.
However, little work has been done in this area due in part to safety concerns of the
assay. Due to the highly transmissible and pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2, handling
of live virus requires biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment 8. Thus, only facilities equipped

with BSL-3 can safely study neutralizing responses using live virus. A safer way is needed
to study viral inhibitors and immunological responses in a practical, reproducible
surrogate assay that effectively replaces the need for the live SARS-CoV-2 to extend this
capability to non-BSL-3 laboratories that are more widely available. Here, we report the
development and use of a high titer lentivirus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 SPG to
screen potential inhibitors in a lower biosafety level laboratory. Since the backbone of this
virus consists of a non-replicating lentivirus, it poses no risk of infection to the personnel
involved, and attachment and entry can be measured by detectable fluorescence intensity
directly correlating with the efficiency of transduction. Using this lentiviral system, we test
the ability of various sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit pseudotyped viral attachment and
entry. We find several sulfated polysaccharides with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. We
demonstrate that SPR can be performed using pseudotyped lentiviral virions, presenting
a more biologically-relevant context for biophysical analysis than isolated SGP protein.
We discuss implications of these findings for both SARS-CoV-2 studies and potential
clinical applications.

Results

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can be efficiently pseudotyped on a lentiviral vector
We used a third generation lentiviral vector (pLV) 9,10 to pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 SPG
for the purpose of these studies. Both VSV-G and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein
pseudotyped pLV efficiently, although, VSV-G was much more efficient, as expected
(Figure S1, Supplementary Information). The success of pseudotyping was assessed by
the expression of green fluorescent protein (gfp) since pLV backbone incorporates the
gene encoding for gfp.

pLV-S transduction inhibited by some sulfated polysaccharides
We tested the ability of twelve different polysaccharides to inhibit pLV-S transduction in
HEK293T cells to determine if SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry can be inhibited by
abrogating the interaction of SGP with cellular HS via the addition of exogenous sulfated
polysaccharides. Results of a blinded analysis of GFP transduction results are shown in

Figure 2. Several polysaccharides exhibited a substantial, concentration-dependent
inhibition of pLV-S transduction. Different polysaccharide structures exhibited vastly
different inhibitory effects. Mammalian chondroitin sulfate and a mixture of GAGs isolated
from silver banded whiting fish Sillago agentifasciata consisting of 90% chondroitin
sulfate, 10% hyaluronic acid 11 showed poor inhibitory qualities. Both UFH and enoxaparin
(a low molecular weight heparin drug) had high apparent inhibitory activity in our screen,
with UFH showing more activity consistent with SPR affinity results 6. Interestingly, two
marine sulfated glycans showed high inhibitory activity in our screen: sulfated fucan
isolated from Lytechinus variegatus (sea urchin) and sulfated galactan from Botryocladia
occidentalis (red seaweed)

12.

Structures of heparin, the sulfated fucan and sulfated

galactan are shown in Figure 3.
No clear structural consistencies in inhibitors are found; fucans and galactans have both
different monosaccharide structure and linkages than heparin, and different sulfation
patterns. Overall sulfate density is similar between sulfated fucan, sulfated galactan, and
cell-surface HS. We performed selective desulfation of both UFH and enoxaparin and
screened them against our pLV-S system to probe structure-function relationships in
sulfated polysaccharide SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory activity. Complete desulfation of both
UFH (UFH-fully-deS) and enoxaparin (enoxaparin-fully-deS) greatly decreased antiSARS-CoV-2 activity. Selective desulfation at the N-position of GlnN (UFH-deNS and
enoxaparin-deNS) similarly decreased inhibitory activity of both UFH and enoxaparin,
consistent with previous SPR results 6,7. In contrast with previous SPR results, however,
we found that selective desulfation at the 6-O-position of GlcN (UFH-de6S and
enoxaparin-de6S) did not significantly reduce inhibitory activity of either UFH or
enoxaparin. Proton NMR analysis revealed the successful selective desulfation of these
samples (see Supplementary Information, Figure S2), indicating the 6-O-sulfation is
not required for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a pseudotyped transduction model.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IC50 determination for heparin derivatives
To test the potency and efficacy of these sulfated glycans, we performed concentrationdependent pseudotypes pLV-S infection assays to determine IC50 values for UFH,

var SF and B. occ. SG. Because of the role of avidity often found in protein-GAG
interactions, IC50 values were measured in terms of mg/L. We tested pLV-S transduction
rates at inhibitor concentrations ranging from 500 mg/L to 5 µg/L, with results shown in
Figure 4. Both UFH and UFH-de6S gave very low IC50 values: 5.99 µg/L and 1.77 µg/L,
respectively. The IC50 of UFH of 5.99 µg/L of heparin is equivalent to a concentration of
~400 pM, which is 10x higher than KD measurements of heparin to SARS-CoV-2 SGP by
SPR 6. IC50 curve fits of UFH and UFH-de6S have substantial uncertainty due to a lack
of sufficient data at concentrations below 5 µg/L; however, the trend is clear. Enoxaparin
and enoxaparin-de6S have substantially weaker inhibitory activities, with IC50 values of
1.08 mg/L and 5.86 mg/L, respectively. A separate batch of pLV-S were used to determine
IC50 values for sulfated fucan, sulfated galactan, enoxaparin-deNS and enoxaparin-fullydeS (Figure S3 Supplementary Information). Detailed IC50 results are summarized in

concentrations of the pLV-S virion were determined from an estimated molecular weight
for pLV-S of 250 MDa. This molecular weight was based on the similarity of pLV to
another enveloped retrovirus (Rous sarcoma virus) having a diameter of ~100 nm 13 and
an estimated mass of 250 MDa14. An on-rate (ka) of 2.9 × 106 M-1 s-1 (± 1.1 × 105), an offrate (kd) of 2.4 × 10-3 s-1 (± 1.9 × 10-5), and a dissociation constant (KD) of 8.5 × 10-10 M
were determined in these direct binding measurements, which is comparable to the IC50
of heparin determined in Table 1.
A variety of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides at 1 M were next examined for their
ability to compete with immobilized heparin for pLV-S binding. Of the GAGs examined,
only soluble heparins, heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfates D and
E were able to compete (Figure S4, Supplementary Information). Competitive binding
was observed only for a very large heparin-derived octadecasaccharide (Figure S5,
Supplementary Information). The heparins showing binding in the competition
experiments were examined at a range of concentrations to determine their IC 50 values.
Soluble heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin (TriS, heparin sulfated at RN, R2 and R6 as
shown in Figure 3), and a non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin (NACH)
showed IC50 values of 125 nM, 500 nM, and 25 M, respectively (Figure S6,
Supplementary Information).

Discussion
Here, we report the development of a lentiviral pseudotyping system for SARS-CoV-2
and its use in screening potential viral entry inhibitors. While a few pseudotyping systems
for SARS-CoV-2 are in development, this report provides evidence that lentiviral
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 can be used to identify potential inhibitors for follow up studies
in mouse models and clinical trials. These pseudoparticles can also be utilized for
screening of inhibitors of SPG-hACE2 binding and resultant virus entry through
biophysical methods such as SPR, with results that are arguably more biologically
relevant than isolated SGP. Their ability to both infect cells and respond to heparin in a
manner consistent with previously published results from active SARS-CoV-2

7

suggest

that this lentiviral pseudotyping system may be useful for screening potential viral entry
inhibitors as they represent SPG on their surface in its native confirmation.

The use of the pseudotyped systems to conveniently test potential inhibitors of viral
attachment and entry has allowed us to perform structure-function analysis to begin to
understand the important characteristics of inhibitory sulfated polysaccharides. Our
finding that enoxaparin, a partially depolymerized heparin with an average molecular
weight of ~4.5 kDa, has lower potency than UFH (average molecular weight ~15 kDa)
even in terms of mg/L is consistent with previous SPR results6, as well as SPR results
presented here (Figure S5, Supplementary Information). The lower potency and higher
KD of the partially depolymerized heparin is consistent with a binding interaction that
involves multiple binding sites on each UFH polysaccharide molecule, which we have
also found in some of our previous studies of protein-GAG interactions 15,16.
As shown in Figure 2, the inhibitory abilities of UFH, sulfated fucan and sulfated
galactan from marine sources suggest that there is considerable flexibility in the SGP
GAG binding site(s). UFH, sulfated fucan from L. variegatus and sulfated galactan from
B. occidentalis all demonstrate substantial inhibitory potency, even though they do not
share monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage sites or stereochemistry, or sites
of sulfation (Figure 3). However, the poor inhibitory activity of chondroitin sulfate indicates
that inhibition is not merely a question of presenting negative charge on a linear polymer.
The role of structural specificity rather than negative charge density is also supported by
some of the SPR competition results presented here; dermatan sulfate, which largely has
one sulfo group per disaccharide, competed for SGP binding similarly to CS-D and CSE, which have two sulfo groups per disaccharide (Figure S4, Supplementary Information).
Also supporting some degree of structural specificity of the SGP GAG binding site(s) are
the results from specifically chemically desulfated UFH and enoxaparin. While complete
desulfation and specific N-desulfation greatly decreases the potency of both UFH and
enoxaparin to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry, 6O-desulfation has little effect
on potency and no effect on efficacy in this assay (Figure 4 and Table 1). These results
are similar but not identical to previously described SPR results performed on GAG
binding to SGP monomer and trimer6,7. In this study we undertook SPR studies on pLVS to better understand the interaction of a pseudovirus particle containing multiple surface
SPGs. The pLV-S showed very tight (~ 1nM) binding to immobilized heparin that could
be effectively competed with using soluble heparin and non-anticoagulant heparin.

Further studies to characterize both pLV-S and SGP-sulfated polysaccharide interactions
are required to understand the optimal binding structure(s).
The ability of various sulfated polysaccharides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 attachment and
entry with high potency presents intriguing and novel opportunities for therapeutic and
prophylactic drug development. Of particular immediate interest are UFH and enoxaparin,
two drugs widely used for anti-coagulation therapy. However, both drugs have substantial
side effects including bleeding, Moreover, both drugs are currently being used as anticoagulants in some COVID-19 cases where evidence of microclotting such as high Ddimer levels is present

17.

The systemic use of UFH or enoxaparin as a COVID-19 anti-

viral treatment or prophylactic has potential for dangerous side effects, and presents
serious complications with potential anti-coagulation COVID-19 treatments. There
remains considerable potential for non-systematic use of UFH or enoxaparin as anti-viral
treatment or prophylaxis. Previous results from both humans

18,19

and rodents indicate

that even very large doses of UFH and enoxaparin administered via inhalation has very
poor serum bioavailability. These results suggest that COVID-19 treatment via an
intranasal or inhalation route should avoid dangerous side effects or complications with
anti-coagulation treatments while potentially still providing a prophylactic or therapeutic
benefit. Based on recent published reports that indicate that the nasal epithelium is a
probable major portal for initial infection and transmission based on viral loads in both
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients

as well as expression patterns of both the
22.

This suggests that a self-administered

nasal spray of UFH may be a simple, safe and effective prophylactic to lower the rates of
SARS-CoV-2 transmission. While single intranasal administration of both UFH and
enoxaparin in a rat model resulted in no noted toxicity and very poor serum bioavailability
23,

we are aware of no studies of repeated dosing of UFH. Longer term toxicology and

pharmacokinetic studies of intranasal UFH, enoxaparin, and -6S derivatives of the two
are currently underway.

control. Polyethylenimine (PEI) reagent (Millipore Sigma, #408727) was used for
transfection following manufacturer’s protocols. Next day, the cells were checked for
transfection efficiency under a fluorescent microscope, indicated by GFP fluorescence.
The supernatants from cell culture at 24 h were harvested and stored at 4 °C and more
(10 ml) complete media (DMEM + 10% FBS) was added to the plates. The supernatant
from cell culture at 48 h was harvested and combined with the 24 h supernatant for each
sample. The combined supernatants were spun in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min at 2000
g to pellet the residual cells and then passed through a 0.45 micron syringe filter. Aliquots
were frozen at -80 °C. New HEK293T cells plated in 12 well tissue culture dishes were
infected with the harvested virus (supernatant) with a dilution range of 10 2 to 107. Virus
titers were calculated by counting the GFP positive cells in the dilution with 20-100 GFP
positive cells.

Inhibitor screening: Serial dilutions of the potential inhibitors (500, 50, 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005
mg/L) were made in DMEM with end volume of 50 µl each. Fifty µl of the supernatant
stock (diluted to give 200-300 GFP + cells/well) was mixed with the diluted samples and
incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Stock + inhibitor dilutions were laid over HEK293T cells plated
in 96 well tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. Medium was
replaced with complete medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) and incubated for another 48 h.
Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and the assay was read on Lionheart FX
automated fluorescent microscope (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The
total number of cells per well was counted using the Object Count feature in Nikon
Elements AR Analysis version 5.02 by a blinded observer. Debris was gated using a
restriction criterion of an area between 20-1000 pixels. Data was analyzed in Prism 8
(Graphpad Inc). Relative IC50 values were calculated in Prism 8 using a fixed top limit of
the average vehicle-only control level (200.2 for the first batch of inhibitors; 120.2 for the
second batch) and a floating bottom limit.

Heparin and enoxaparin sodium desulfation for pseudotyped virus inhibition: Prior
to desulfation, heparin and enoxaparin sodium were first converted to their pyridinium
salts by passing through a self-packed cation-exchange column with Dowex 50 W resin,
followed by lyophilization.

27

For N-desulfation, the 1 mg pyridinium salts were

resuspended in 1 mL 5% methanol in DMSO and heated at 50°C for 1.5 hour. The sample
was diluted and purified with a 3 kDa Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore, Temecula,
CA, USA) to remove low molecular weight impurities.

28

For 6-O-desulfation, the 1 mg

pyridinium salts were added to 10 volumes (w/w) of MSTFA and 100 volumes (v/w) of
pyridine. The mixture was incubated at 100°C for 30 min and then quickly cooled in an
ice-bath.

29

The sample was dried under nitrogen gas flow and purified with a 3 kDa

Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA) to remove low molecular
weight impurities. Selectively desulfated products were analyzed by proton NMR to
determine the extent and specificity of desulfation. Details of the NMR analyses are
shown in the Supplementary Information. For full desulfation, the 1 mg pyridinium salts
were resuspended in 1 mL 10% methanol in DMSO and heated at 100°C for 6 hours.

30

The fully-desulfated products were dried, and administered as pyridinium salts for further
studies.

Surface Plasmon Resonance: Biotinylated heparin was prepared by conjugating its
reducing end to amine-PEG3-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL). In brief, heparin (2 mg) and
amine-PEG3-Biotin (2 mg, Pierce, Rockford, IL) were dissolved in 200 µl H 2O, 10 mg
NaCNBH3 was added. The reaction mixture was heated at 70 °C for 24 h, after that a
further 10 mg NaCNBH3 was added and the reaction was heated at 70 °C for another 24
h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was desalted with the spin column
(3,000 MWCO). Biotinylated heparin was collected, freeze-dried and used for SA chip
preparation. The biotinylated heparin was immobilized to streptavidin (SA) chip based on
the manufacturer’s protocol. The successful immobilization of heparin was confirmed by
the observation of a 600-resonance unit (RU) increase on the sensor chip. The control
flow cell (FC1) was prepared by 2 min injection with saturated biotin.
Direct binding of the pseudotype particles to surface immobilized heparin was

determined by SPR. The pseudotype particles samples were diluted in HBS-EP buffer
(0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). Different
dilutions of pseudotype particles samples were injected at a flow rate of 30 µL/min. At
the end of the sample injection, the same buffer was flowed over the sensor surface to
facilitate dissociation. After a 3 min dissociation time the sensor surface was regenerated
by injecting with 30 µL of 2 M NaCl to obtain a fully regenerated surface. The response
was monitored as a function of time (sensorgram) at 25 °C.
Solution competition studies on pseudotype particles, between heparin immobilized on
the chip surface and soluble heparins, heparin-oligosaccharides or other GAGs, were
performed using SPR. Pseudotype particles (0.35 nM) mixed with 1 M or varying
concentrations of heparins, heparin-derived oligosaccharides, or GAGs in HBS-EP buffer
were injected over heparin chip at a flow rate of 30 L/min, respectively. After each run,
the dissociation and the regeneration were performed as described above and where
binding was observed at 1 M, the IC50 was determined.
