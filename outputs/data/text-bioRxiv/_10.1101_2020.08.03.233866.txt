Abstract
Large research efforts are going into characterizing, mapping the spread, and studying the
biology and clinical features of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Here, we report four complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained
from patients confirmed to have the disease in Stockholm, Sweden, in late April. A variant
at position 23463 was found for the first time in one genome. It changes an arginine (R)
residue to histidine (H) at position 364 in the S1 subunit of the spike protein. The genomes
belonged to two different genetic groups, previously reported as two of the three main
genetic groups found in Sweden. Three of them are from group B.1/G, corresponding to
the Italian outbreak, reported by the Public Health Agency of Sweden to have declined in

prevalence by late April, and more investigation is needed in order to ensure that the
spread of different types of SARS-CoV-2 is fully characterized.

A severe pneumonia disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019
and has rapidly spread around the world (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). In Sweden,
at the time of writing, more than 78,504 cases have been reported and 5,667 deaths have
been confirmed (FHM, 2020). As this virus is new to humans, large research efforts are
going into characterizing the virus, mapping its spread, and studying its biology and clinical
features. We here report four complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained from
patients confirmed to have the disease. The sampling and tests were carried out on April
26, 2020, at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 23 patients suspected to have COVID-19. In
17 of these, an RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 (Corman et al., 2020) yielded a positive
result. Viral RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized using the QIAseq FX Single
Cell RNA Library Kit (QIAGEN). Illumina libraries with 350 bp fragments for shotgun
sequencing were prepared using the ThruPLEX DNA-seq kit (Rubicon Genomics) and
sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq technology (2x300bp).
Low quality sequences and adapters were removed using Trim Galore (version 0.4.1),
followed by the removal of human sequences using Bowtie (version 2.3.2) (Langmead and
Salzberg, 2012) and the human genome reference GRCh38.p13 (GenBank accession
number GCA_000001405.28). The remaining reads were mapped to the complete
genome of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession number MN908947.3) using
Bowtie. The mapped reads were subsequently assembled using the Genome Detective
Virus Tool (version 1.126) (Vilsker et al., 2019) using SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank accession
number MN908947.3) as reference (Table 1) and nucleotide variants were assigned for
each genome (Table 2).
SARS-CoV-2 reads were detected in nine of the samples, with variable coverage. Near
complete genomes could be assembled from four samples, with a median of 29825.5±7.4
bp in length, covering 99.7-99.8% of the reference genome and 100% of the coding

region, with a depth of coverage ranging from 776.8 to 1718.2. An additional genome
assembly covered 80.6% of the reference genome, in 17 contigs with an average of 12.2
(Table 1).
Compared with the reference strain (GenBank accession number MN908947.3), the four
complete genomes each have between 9 to 14 single nucleotide differences. All four
genomes have mutations in noncoding position 241 C to T, and three mutations in coding
regions, two C to T in positions 3037 and 14408, and one A to G in the position 23403
(Table 2).
The variant at 23463 bp, found in patient P17157_1020, was not found in any other SARSCoV-2 genome that was present in GISAID and Genbank at the time that this report was
drafted (13 July 2020). The impact of this spike protein R364H variant (Figure 1) was
predicted by the DUET Web server (Pires et al., 2014) to have destabilizing effects. The
variant is located at the surface of the S1 subunit, and could possibly affect the attachment
of the virion to the cell, even though it does not change the receptor-binding domain itself.
We compared the four complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Stockholm with genomes
detected globally using the three main methods available to classify relationships between
different genetic variants of the virus: GISAID, Nextstrain, and PANGOLIN (Hadfield et al.,
2018; Rambaut et al., 2020). The Stockholm genomes belonged to two genetic groups:
20C/B.1/G and 20B/B.1.1/GR (Table 3). These groups were reported by the Public Health
Agency of Sweden as two of the three main genetic groups found in Sweden (FHM, 2020).
Somewhat surprisingly, three of the completed genomes described here are from group
B.1/G, which was reported to have declined in prevalence by late April. This lineage has
spread to more than 20 countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Australia and
corresponds to the Italian outbreak.
