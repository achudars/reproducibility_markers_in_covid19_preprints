Abstract

27

The development of physiological models that reproduce SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary

28

human cells will be instrumental to identify host-pathogen interactions and potential

29

therapeutics. Here, using cell suspensions from primary human lung tissues (HLT), we have

30

developed a platform for the identification of viral targets and the expression of viral entry

31

factors, as well as for the screening of viral entry inhibitors and anti-inflammatory compounds.

32

We show that the HLT model preserves its main cell populations, maintains the expression of

33

proteins required for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and identifies alveolar type II (AT-II) cells as the most

34

susceptible cell targets for SARS-CoV-2 in the human lung. Antiviral testing of 39 drug candidates

35

revealed a highly reproducible system, and provided the identification of new compounds

36

missed by conventional systems such as VeroE6. Using this model, we also show that interferons

37

do not modulate ACE2 expression, and that stimulation of local inflammatory responses can be

38

modulated by different compounds with antiviral activity. Overall, we present a novel and

39

relevant physiological model for the study of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

53

We are facing a global health emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel SARS-

54

CoV-2 virus. There is currently no specific treatment to cure SARS-CoV-2 infection to limit disease

55

progression of associated COVID-19. Early clinical trials showed promising drug candidates;

56

remdesivir, a compound that inhibits the RNA synthesis of SARS-CoV-2, was superior to placebo

57

in shortening the time to recovery in adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 [1], however,

58

the Solidarity trial failed to support this observation [2]. Recently, plitidepsin, a molecule that

59

targets the eEF1A host protein has shown potent preclinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 [3].

60

Importantly, the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in severe COVID-19

61

patients has been linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. In this regard, the

62

glucocorticoid dexamethasone decreased 28-day mortality among patients receiving invasive

63

mechanical ventilation, but no benefit was observed in patients without respiratory support [4].

64

Thus, no effective treatment is currently available for COVID-19, and the rapid identification of

65

antivirals with the potential to be easily transferred into the clinic could save human lives.

66

Screening of novel drug candidates is often performed using cell lines. In this sense, the most

67

widely used cell lines for SARS-CoV-2 studies are epithelial cells derived either from lung (Calu-

68

3), kidney (VeroE6), or colon (CaCo-2) [5]. These immortalized systems are highly reproducible

69

and easy to handle but lack physiological relevance. The differential gene expression profiling of

70

cell lines compared with primary cells from tissues might significantly affect important enzymes

71

involved in the viral replication cycle. For instance, the level of ACE2 expression, the main

72

receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 for viral entry, is shown to be different in several cell lines [6],

73

while only a small fraction of alveolar type II (AT-II) cells, the main target for SARS-CoV-2 in the

74

lung, express ACE2 [7, 8]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, which is responsible for

75

viral entry into target cells, can be activated by several host proteases, such as furin,

76

transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L, in a pH-dependent or

77

independent manner [9, 10]. Whereas in some cell lines S protein is activated by endosomal pH-

78

dependent protease cathepsin L, in airway epithelial cells viral entry depends on the pH-

79

independent TMPRSS2 protease [10]. Thus, it is currently not well defined if SARS-CoV-2 may

80

utilize multiple cell-type-specific host proteins for viral replication in primary target tissues and

81

therefore, the potency of therapeutics directed against these proteins may also differ.

82

Further, inflammatory immune responses might also impact viral dynamics in the lung by

83

affecting the expression of entry receptors. In this sense, early studies discovered that ACE2 was

84

a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG); IFN-β and IFN-γ were shown to strongly upregulate

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440731; this version posted April 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

85

the expression of ACE2 at the mRNA and cell surface protein levels, indicating that inflammatory

86

molecules could shape cell susceptibility to viral infection [11]. However, how anti-inflammatory

87

drugs may affect ACE2 expression and facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be elucidated.

88

One study reported that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as

89

ibuprofen, was linked to enhanced ACE2 expression in a diabetic-induced rat model [12] and

90

other reports raised alarms regarding the possible role of NSAIDs at increasing susceptibility to

91

SARS-CoV-2 infection [13, 14]. On the contrary, experimental and clinical evidence show that

92

medium-to-low-dose glucocorticoids may play a protective role in COVID-19 by activating ACE2

93

and suppressing the associated cytokine storm [15]. Overall, the use of more relevant and

94

physiological models for the study of either SARS-CoV-2 infection, the identification of drug

95

candidates, or the impact of new therapeutics on the disease could significantly advance the

96

successful translation of the results into the clinic.

97

Primary epithelial cell cultures of nasal and proximal airway epithelium have been used to study

98

SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airways [8, 16-18]. Similarly, organ on-chip and organoids

99

models of AT-II cells have been successfully developed [17, 19]. While very promising, these

100

models still miss certain aspects of cellular complexity present in primary tissues [20]. In this

101

regard, establishing a human lung tissue (HLT) model could offer a physiologically relevant

102

alternative to in vitro and in vivo approaches for several reasons; it mimics the main site of viral

103

replication in the lung, and contains all heterogeneous cell components present in the tissue

104

with greater functional complexity compared to cell lines. Although still representing a

105

reductionist ex vivo approach, it allows controlled experimental conditions. In the past, similar

106

lung models have been successfully established to study the effect of allergens and

107

inflammatory stimuli [21, 22]. Importantly, the HLT model allows mimicking an inflammatory

108

local response that could be attenuated by anti-inflammatory drugs [23]. Furthermore, it has

109

been used to provide low/medium throughput screening of anti-inflammatory candidate drugs

110

for the treatment of airway diseases [23]. Significantly, lung tissues not only can be infected with

111

SARS-CoV-2, but also generate local immune responses to viral infection [24]. Considering all

112

these factors, here we aimed to develop and characterize a physiological and reproducible

113

human lung tissue model, which could be used for the study of virus-host interactions,

114

identification of potential antiviral compounds, as well as help investigating the role of

115

inflammation in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

117

Characterization of the HLT model

118

To establish the HLT model, non-neoplastic areas from lung tissue resections were obtained

119

from hospitalized non-COVID19 patients undergoing thoracic surgery. First, we optimized cell

120

culture and digestion conditions, since the methodology used for tissue processing can

121

significantly impact viability and function of target cell populations. Thus, we tested the

122

preservation of AT-II, defined mainly by EpCAM and HLA-DR expression [25], and of several

123

hematopoietic cell subsets, after tissue digestion with different enzymes. Flow cytometry gating

124

strategy and cell markers used for identification of main populations are shown in Figure S1A.

125

We observed that collagenase outperformed liberase and trypsin at preserving AT-II cells, the

126

main SARS-CoV-2 target (Figure S2A-B). Among the hematopoietic cells present in the lung

127

tissue we identified CD3 T (which represented 1.94% ± 0.59 out of the total live cell fraction),

128

myeloid dendritic cells (0.03% ± 0.007), monocytes/macrophages subsets (0.42 ± 0.14%),

129

neutrophils (1.80% ± 0.53) and alveolar macrophages (0.05% ± 0.01). Moreover, non-

130

hematopoietic cells such as AT-II and endothelial cells represented 0.24% ± 0.05 and 0.5% ± 0.15

131

out of the total live cell fraction, respectively (Figure 1A). All populations have been previously

132

identified in human lungs [24, 26, 27]. Moreover, the nature of AT-II cells in lung cell suspensions

133

was confirmed by staining with phosphatase alkaline (Figure 1B), which has been shown to be a

134

reliable marker of type II cell phenotype both in vitro and in vivo [28]. Next, we focus on the

135

expression of previously identified proteins involved in viral entry. Single-cell transcriptome

136

studies have shown that ACE2, one of the main host cell surface receptors for SARS-CoV-2

137

attachment and infection, is predominantly expressed by AT-II cells [8, 29]. Moreover, ACE2

138

expression wanes in distal bronchiolar and alveolar regions paralleled by SARS-CoV-2 infectivity

139

[8]. In human parenchyma lung cells, we found ACE2 expression mainly in AT-II cells (Figure 1C),

140

a finding that was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1D). Percentage of AT-II cells

141

expressing ACE2 was rather small and varied between individuals (6.29% ± 1.00) (Figure 1C), as

142

previously described [7]. We also studied the expression of CD147 on lung cells, which has been

143

reported as a novel route of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and in vivo models [30]. CD147 was

144

ubiquitously expressed in several hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells (Figure 1C).

145

Importantly, 92.3% ± 1.14 of AT-II cells expressed CD147 (Figure 1C). Similarly, and in agreement

146

with other studies [31], TMPRSS2 protease expression was identified in AT-II cells (21.33% ±

147

7.52) (Figure 1C). Overall, we found that human lung suspensions preserved critical cell

148

populations and the expression of factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

149

Susceptibility of HLT cells to SARS-CoV-2 viral entry

150

Next, we assessed if HLT cells were susceptible to viral infection. We generated pseudotyped

151

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) viral particles bearing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and expressing

152

either luciferase (VSV*∆G (Luc)-S) or GFP (VSV*∆G (GFP)-S) reporter genes upon cell entry. As a

153

control, we used the VSV-G virus, which has very broad cell tropism. As expected, VeroE6 cells

154

were highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 entry, as demonstrated for VSV*∆G (GFP)-S and VSV-∆G

155

(Luc)-S (Figure 2A). Anti-ACE2 antibody blocked more than 90% of VSV*∆G (Luc)-S, but was

156

inactive for VSV-G (Luc) infection (Figure 2B). This observation has been widely reported before

157

[10, 32, 33], and identifies ACE2 as the main cell receptor required for viral entry in VeroE6.

158

Importantly for viral pathogenesis, it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 S protein might

159

downregulate ACE2 expression, as previously observed for SARS-CoV [34]. We consistently

160

observed a significant strong reduction in ACE2 expression after viral entry (Figure 2C).

161

We then evaluated the susceptibility of HLT cells to viral entry, using the same viral

162

constructs. HLT cells were readily infected with pseudotyped S particles (VSV*∆G (Luc)-S and

163

VSV*∆G (GFP)-S), with the natural donor variation representative of primary samples (Figure

164

2D). As expected [8], lung cells compatible with an AT-II phenotype were identified as the main

165

cell targets in steady conditions (Figure 2E). Blockade of ACE2 resulted in a donor-dependent

166

reduction of viral infectivity, ranging from 50 to 100% (Figure 2F). Camostat, a TMPRSS2

167

inhibitor, significantly inhibited viral entry in all HLT assays, although the entry process was not

168

always completely abrogated (Figure 2F), suggesting that AT-II cells may become infected

169

through the use of alternative factors [35]. Similarly, the presence of an anti-CD147 antibody

170

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry in AT-II cells (Figure 2F). Collectively, these data indicate that HLT

171

cells are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and that ACE2, CD147 and TMPRSS2 are

172

important proteins for viral entry in human lung cells. Overall, these results support the value of

173

the HLT model to successfully study SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, and related mechanisms, in a more

174

physiological system.

175

Antiviral assays in the HLT model

176

To validate the HLT model as a platform for the screening of antiviral candidates, we assayed

177

potential antiviral compounds, most of them previously identified by computational methods

178

with predicted ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell entry due to their interaction with S protein or

179

with the interface S-ACE2 [36]. A detailed description of the 39 selected drugs is available in

180

Table S1. HLT cells were exposed to VSV*∆G (Luc)-S virus in the presence of 1/5 serial dilution

181

of the different tested compounds. 20h post-exposure, antiviral activity and cell viability were

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440731; this version posted April 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

182

measured by luminescence. Results in HLT cells were systematically compared with antiviral

183

testing performed in the cell line VeroE6. Among 39 drugs that were evaluated in our study, 16

184

(41%) showed some antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 values ranging from 0.5µM

185

to 66µM (Table S2). We observed that 23% of drugs had concordant results between both

186

models (Figure 3). Cepharanthine, a naturally occurring alkaloid reported to have potent anti-

187

inflammatory and antiviral properties, was one of the most potent antivirals identified in both

188

systems, with EC50 of 0.4µM and 6.1µM in VeroE6 and HLT cells, respectively (Figure 3A and B).

189

Of note, we observed cell toxicity at the highest concentrations (CC50 VeroE6= 22.3µM; CC50 HLT=

190

13.8µM), which translated in a satisfactory selectivity index (SI) in VeroE6 cells, but close to the

191

standard threshold of 2 in HLT cells (SI VeroE6 = 55.7; SI HLT = 2.2) [37]. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

192

of hydroxychloroquine, a compound known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary

193

for the proteolytic activity of cathepsins, has been extensively reported [38, 39]. In our study,

194

we observed that hydroxychloroquine was equally effective at inhibiting viral entry in VeroE6

195

and HLT cells (EC50 VeroE6= 1.58µM; EC50 HLT= 9.26µM) (Figure 3A, B), with no apparent cytotoxicity

196

(Figure 3C). Ergoloid, an approved drug used for dementia, and recently identified as a potential

197

inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease [40], induced a 90% viral entry inhibition in HLT cells at

198

non-toxic concentrations (Figure 3A-C). Indeed, SI for this compound was higher in the HLT

199

model than in VeroE6 cells (SIVeroE6 = 3.9; SIHLT = 11.38). Similarly, ivermectin, a broad-spectrum

200

anti-parasitic compound, showed very similar antiviral potency in both models, however SI

201

greatly differed (SIVeroE6 = 1.4; SIHLT = 8). Additionally, we also calculated the Coefficient of

202

Variation (CV) of the antiviral assays as a measure of relative variation in 50% Effective

203

Concentration (EC50) values. We show that the CV varied from 0.9 to 15.36% in HLT cells (Figure

204

3D). The low CV obtained highlights the suitability of the HLT model for the identification of

205

antivirals.

206

We also detected discordant antiviral results between both models (Figure 4). Indeed, 5

207

drugs inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry in HLT cells without affecting cell viability, but no effect was

208

observed in VeroE6 (Figure 4A-C). As expected, camostat, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor [41], was not

209

active in VeroE6 cells due to lack of TMPRSS2 expression in this cell line. However, camostat was

210

highly active in HLT cells (EC50=2.7µM). Indeed, a clinical trial testing its potential to prevent

211

SARS-CoV-2 transmission is ongoing (NCT04625114). Further, sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-

212

inflammatory drug, and valaciclovir, an antiviral drug, presented some inhibitory potential at

213

100 µM only in HLT cells. Interestingly, phenformin, an antidiabetic drug and an mTOR inhibitor,

214

has been postulated as an inhaled drug candidate against influenza and coronavirus infections

215

[42]. Phenformin reduced the incidence of influenza infection in diabetic patients during the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440731; this version posted April 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

216

1971 outbreak [42]. Here, we observed that phenformin significantly reduced viral entry starting

217

at 4µM only in HLT cells, supporting previous recommendations as inhaled treatment. Finally,

218

eriodictyol, a flavonoid used as a medicinal plant [43], demonstrated certain activity at 20-

219

100µM. In contrast, luteolin induced potent viral entry suppression only in VeroE6 cells at high

220

concentrations (Figure 4A-C). Overall, these results indicate that the HLT is a reproducible and

221

highly relevant model for antiviral testing in a physiological system that recapitulates main

222

antiviral activities observed in cell models, and offers the identification of new compounds

223

missed by conventional systems.

224
225

Impact of inflammation and anti-inflammatory drugs on ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2
viral entry

226

Since SARS-CoV-2 viral infection rapidly induces an inflammatory response, we wondered if

227

certain components of this response could modulate ACE2 expression, potentially allowing

228

increased viral binding of SARS-CoV-2 and thus, enhancing infection. Further, ACE2 has been

229

previously identified as an ISG or a component of the IFN-signaling pathway [11, 44], and a

230

recent investigation showed that cultured human primary basal epithelial cells treated with IFN-

231

α2 and IFN-γ led to upregulation of ACE2 [11]. Moreover, IL-1β and IFN-β upregulated ACE2 in

232

large airway epithelial cell cultures [8]. Thus, considering that type I interferons represent a first

233

line of defence against viral infections and that several cytokines are rapidly induced and

234

associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients [45], we tested the effects of different

235

molecules on ACE2 expression in our model. In initial experiments, we tested three different

236

doses of a wider range of molecules (including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6 and IFN-γ), which

237

were used to select doses and compounds of interest. Finally, the effect of IFN-α2, IFN-β1, IL-

238

1β, IL-10 and GM-CSF on ACE2 expression was evaluated in the HLT model. Cells were then

239

treated with selected immune stimuli and cultured for 20h, when the expression of ACE2 in AT-

240

II cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. The only significant change we observed was for IL-1β

241

stimulation, which decreased the fraction of AT-II cells expressing ACE2 (Figure 5A). No other

242

significant changes were observed. Overall, we show that relevant inflammatory stimuli have a

243

limited impact on ACE2 expression in AT-II cells, while the effect and impact of IL-1 β on viral

244

infection should be further explored.

245

It is currently not well documented if anti-inflammatory drugs could modulate ACE2

246

expression, and consequently, might impact susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection [46]. Several

247

glucocorticoids have shown to impart activating effects on ACE2 expression in cell lines; cortisol

248

showed the strongest effect on ACE2 activation, followed by prednisolone, dexamethasone, and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440731; this version posted April 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

249

methylprednisolone [15]. Moreover, NSAIDs, compounds that inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 and 2

250

mediating the production of prostaglandins, which play a role in inflammatory responses, have

251

been linked to ACE2 upregulation [15]. Here, we took advantage of our HLT model to study the

252

effect of several anti-inflammatory drugs on both ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.

253

1/5 dilutions of ibuprofen, cortisol, dexamethasone and prednisone were added to HLT cells for

254

20h. Overall, no effect on ACE2 expression was observed after the addition of these anti-

255

inflammatory drugs (Figure 5B). Consequently, the antiviral assay showed no major impact of

256

anti-inflammatory compounds on viral entry; however, high concentrations of prednisone and

257

dexamethasone showed a partial reduction of viral entry in HLT cells, without any apparent

258

impact on VeroE6 (Figure 5C). Thus, we show that selected anti-inflammatory drugs have limited

259

impact on ACE2 expression within AT-II cells present in the HLT model, as well as in SARS-CoV-2

260

viral entry.

261

Anti-inflammatory properties of selected compounds

262

Last, we were interested in modelling the anti-inflammatory properties of several drugs in

263

our HLT model. Based on their antiviral potency in HLT cells, we selected cepharanthine,

264

ergoloid, camostat, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and ciclesonide for further evaluation. Of

265

note, some of these drugs have been previously identified as immunomodulators with anti-

266

inflammatory effects (Table S1). However, their direct impact on inflammatory molecules

267

directly secreted by human lung cells has not been evaluated. HLT cells were stimulated with

268

lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and IFN-γ in the presence of these antivirals and, 20h after, the

269

expression of IL-6 and CXCL10, a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine respectively,

270

was intracellularly measured by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 6A, two major

271

subpopulations of myeloid cells contributed to the upregulation of CXCL10 and IL-6 expression

272

upon stimulation. Myeloid CD11b+CD14+ were the cells with a greater response, showing 50%

273

of cells expressing IL-6 and 30% expressing CXCL10 after stimulation (Figure 6B). Using this

274

model of local inflammation, we tested the capacity of the selected compounds to modify this

275

response. We observed that camostat had the most potent effect, which significantly reduced

276

the expression of CXCL10 in CD11b+CD14- and of IL-6 in CD11b+CD14+ myeloid subsets (Figure

277

6B). Ergoloid, which has not been linked to modulation of inflammation before, significantly

278

reduced the expression of cytokines in CD11b+ CD14+ myeloid cells, and cepharantine reduced

279

IL-6 production from this subset. Finally, ciclesonide induced CXCL10 secretion in CD11b+CD14-

280

myeloid cells (Figure 6B). Altogether, our results validate the HLT model as a relevant method

281

for the identification of anti-inflammatory compounds impacting specific pro-inflammatory cell

282

populations from the lung parenchyma.

Discussion

284

The emergency created by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide required a

285

quick response from physicians treating these patients, who adapted to the rapid knowledge

286

being generated by both clinical practice and basic research. However, up to date, no specific

287

drugs against SARS-CoV-2 have been approved for clinical use. In this sense, the choice of the

288

cell and animal models used to test the efficacy of antivirals will impact its rapid translation into

289

the clinics. Here, we have developed a novel human lung tissue (HLT) model that can be safely

290

performed in a BSL2 facility, which allows i) the identification of cell targets and expression of

291

viral entry factors, ii) the impact of inflammation on host-pathogen interactions and iii) a rapid

292

medium-high throughput drug screening of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors and local anti-

293

inflammatory candidates.

294

While cell lines have been traditionally used for the screening of potential antiviral

295

compounds due to their reproducibility, as well as being quick and user-friendly assays, they lack

296

physiological relevance. Similarly, entry receptors and viral factors have been identified using

297

immortalized cell lines [10, 47], and cell targets for SARS-CoV-2 in tissues have been mainly

298

determined by analyzing the expression of viral entry factors in RNA-seq datasets [48] or using

299

replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates in BSL3 facilities [49]. Importantly, these studies

300

have identified AT-II cells as main viral targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs, and the

301

molecules ACE2, CD147 and TMPRSS2 as the main factors for viral entry [10, 30, 50]. However,

302

the development of more refined and translational ex vivo models of SARS-CoV-2 entry will not

303

only have implications for understanding viral pathogenesis, but also will be useful for the

304

characterization of cell targets under specific conditions and the identification of potential

305

antivirals blocking infection of primary cells. In our HLT model, the maintenance of cell type

306

complexity in their in vivo proportions may represent a significant advantage over previous

307

models [17, 19, 51]. Using pseudotyped viral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike, we first

308

corroborated that AT-II cells are the primary cell target in lung tissue in steady conditions. This

309

agrees with several studies using different approximations [11, 52, 53] and validates our primary

310

model for viral tropism identification.

311

Moreover, we showed that the HLT model can be successfully used for drug screening

312

purposes. We tested 39 drugs and compared the results with antiviral testing in VeroE6 cells.

313

Not surprisingly, we showed discordant results between both models. Indeed, we found that

314

37.5% of the tested compounds had discordant results between HLT and VeroE6 cells; 31.25%

315

of drugs showed some antiviral effect in HLT but no activity was detected in VeroE6, and 6.2%

316

showed only antiviral effects in VeroE6 cells. Among other reasons, the differential expression

317

of several key proteins needed for viral entry, might explain current discrepancies between

318

models. Importantly, using the HLT model, we identified several compounds with antiviral

319

activity; cepharanthine showed an EC50 of 6.1µM and concordantly, it was recently identified in

320

a high throughput screening as one of the most potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 [54], likewise

321

several other studies have pointed towards this drug as a potent entry and post-entry SARS-CoV-

322

2 inhibitor [55]. Instead, for hydroxychloroquine, an early report suggested no antiviral activity

323

in human lung cells due to different expression of the required proteases for viral entry [56]. In

324

our study, however, we observed that this drug was equally effective at inhibiting viral entry in

325

VeroE6 and HLT cells. Nevertheless, clinical trials failed to show effectiveness of this drug as a

326

treatment for COVID-19 [57-59]. Recently, a strong dependency of SARS-CoV-2 on TMPRSS2 for

327

viral entry, rather than on cathepsin L, was identified as a possible mechanistic explanation for

328

its failure in vivo [60]. Similarly, we identified ivermectin as an effective antiviral in HLT cells. Of

329

note, ivermectin received limited attention as a potential drug to be repurposed against COVID-

330

19 based on its limited ability to reach lung tissue in vivo [61]. Further, a clinical trial failed to

331

show a reduction in the proportion of PCR-positive patients seven days after ivermectin

332

treatment [62].

333

Importantly, the HLT model also provides a platform for testing anti-inflammatory drugs and

334

the modulation of viral entry factors with drug candidates and immunomodulatory stimuli. We

335

showed that IL-1β was able to reduce ACE2 expression in AT-II cells, in contrast to other

336

cytokines induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection like IFN-α2, IFN-β1, IL-10 and GM-CSF, which did

337

not impact ACE2 protein production. In primary epithelial cells derived from healthy nasal

338

mucosa, Ziegler et al. [11] showed a significant induction of ACE2 transcripts after IFN-α2 and

339

IFN-γ stimulation, as well as and in a human bronchial cell line treated with either type I or type

340

II IFN. Moreover, the authors showed that influenza A virus infection increased ACE2 expression

341

in lung resections [11], strongly suggesting that ACE2 was an ISG. However, following studies

342

showed that ACE2 transcription and protein production was not responsive to IFN. Instead, they

343

described a new RNA isoform, MIRb-ACE2, that was highly responsive to IFN stimulation, but

344

importantly, encoded a truncated and unstable protein product [63, 64]. These results highlight

345

the need to validate scRNA-seq data with orthogonal approaches, such as the confirmation of

346

protein expression levels in relevant systems. In the HLT model, we quantified ACE2 protein

347

expression and importantly, focused our analysis on AT-II cells, the main SARS-CoV-2 targets in

348

lung parenchyma. Also, in agreement with our results, a primary human bronchial epithelial cell

349

model, type I (β), II (γ), or III (λ1) IFNs did not induced ACE2 expression [65]. Moreover, a study

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.440731; this version posted April 23, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

350

performed by Lang et al [66], showed that IFN-γ and IL-4 downregulate the SARS-CoV receptor

351

ACE2 in VeroE6 cells, and similarly, stimulation of A549 cells with IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IFN-α+IFN-γ

352

did not identify ACE2 as an ISG [67].

353

A feasible explanation for the increase of ACE2 protein production upon IL-1 β treatment is

354

that IL-1β activates disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17)

355

[68], which mediates the shedding of ACE2 [69]. Although this effect would seem positive to

356

reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, ACE2 is a lung-protective factor, as it converts Angiotensin (Ang)

357

II to Ang-(1–7); while Ang II promotes harmful effects in the lung, e. g. fibrosis, vasoconstriction,

358

inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, edema, and neutrophil accumulation[70], Ang-(1-7) has

359

counter-regulatory effects protective of lung injury. Moreover, Ang-(1–7) plays an essential role

360

in hemostasis, as it favors anti-thrombotic activity in platelets [71]. In any case, treatment of

361

COVID-19 patients with respiratory insufficiency and hyper inflammation with IL-1 inhibitors was

362

associated with a significant reduction of mortality [72], indicating that at least during severe

363

COVID-19 the overall effect of IL-1β is detrimental. While the reduction of ACE2 expression in

364

AT-II cells by IL-1β may be of interest, it needs to be determined if in combination with other

365

cytokines rapidly induced during viral respiratory infection [73], this effect would remain.

366

Further, glucocorticoids and NSAIDS have been linked to ACE2 upregulation previously [15].

367

In contrast, we did not observe any significant impact of ibuprofen, cortisol, dexamethasone and

368

prednisone on ACE2 protein expression. These results are concordant with a recent report

369

showing that suppression of ciclooxigenase (COX)-2 by two commonly used NSAIDs, ibuprofen

370

and meloxicam, had no effect on ACE2 expression, viral entry, or viral replication in a mouse

371

model of SARS-CoV-2 infection [74]. Moreover, dexamethasone incompletely reduced viral

372

entry. This observation partially agrees with a study using lung cells previously treated with

373

dexamethasone, which showed significant suppression of SARS-CoV-2 viral growth [24].

374

In addition, we used the model for testing local inflammation and potential anti-

375

inflammatory drugs. Several resident and recruited myeloid subsets may contribute to the rapid

376

cytokine storm detected in COVID-19 patients [75-77]. Thus, the identification of antiviral drugs

377

that can also limit the extent of these initial pro-inflammatory events may offer added value to

378

the overall therapeutic effect of a given drug. In this sense, we observed that camostat

379

significantly reduced the expression of proinflammatory molecules IL-6 and CXCL10 in several

380

myeloid CD11b+ subsets. Concordantly, in a previous study using primary cultures of human

381

tracheal epithelial cells infected with H1N1 virus, camostat also reduced the concentrations of

382

the cytokines IL-6 and TNF in cell supernatants [78], suggesting a potent anti-inflammatory

383

potential. In contrast, ivermectin did not affect the expression of cytokines in our model.

384

Differing from previous results, ivermectin was shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in mice

385

and in vitro using murine macrophages; ivermectin reduced the production of TNF, IL-1 and IL-

386

6, and suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB translocation[79]. Of note, our HLT model of inflammation

387

is optimized up to detect changes in the intracellular expression of cytokines by local myeloid

388

cells, and thus, how these intracellular changes reflect total cytokine production in supernatant

389

needs further evaluation.

390

Finally, it is also important to note the potential limitations of the model, including the limited

391

availability of human lung samples, inter-patient variation (age, smoking, etc.), the effects on

392

lung biology of the medical condition instigating surgery, and the location of the sample

393

resection which may affect the proportion of cell subsets such as AT-II. However, this variability

394

is what shapes the HLT into a highly physiological and relevant model in comparison to current

395

methods based on immortalized cell cultures. Besides the interest of the model proposed here,

396

our results highlight drugs with antiviral activity in HLT cells together with immunomodulatory

397

properties, which could increase the benefit of this treatment during COVID-19 disease

398

progression. For instance, camostat, cepharantine and ergoloid were three of the most potent

399

drugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry, and remarkably, also exerted a significant anti-inflammatory

400

effect on myeloid cells. Clinical trials with camostat, currently ongoing, ergoloid and

401

cepharatine, will shed light on their use as both antivirals and anti-inflammatory compounds.

Materials and methods

403

Cells and virus

404

VeroE6, isolated from kidney epithelial cells of an African green monkey, were grown in

405

DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) 100 U/ml penicillin,

406

and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Capricorn Scientific) (D10) and maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2

407

incubator.

408

The spike of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was generated (GeneArt Gene Synthesis, ThermoFisher

409

Scientific) from the codon-optimized sequence obtained by Ou et al.[35] and inserted into

410

pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (pcDNA3.1-S-CoV2∆19-G614). This plasmid presents the mutation

411

D614G and a deletion in the last 19 amino acids from the original spike. Pseudotyped viral stocks

412

of VSV*ΔG(Luc)-S were generated following the protocol described by Whitt [80] with some

413

modifications. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with 3µg of the plasmid encoding the SARS-

414

CoV-2 spike. Next day, cells were infected with a VSV-G-Luc virus (MOI=1) (generated from a

415

lentiviral backbone plasmid that uses a VSV promoter to express luciferase) for 2h and gently

416

washed with PBS. Cells were incubated overnight in D10 supplemented with 10% of I1

417

hybridoma (anti-VSV-G) supernatant (ATCC CRL-2700) to neutralize contaminating

418

VSV*ΔG(Luc)-G particles. Next day, the resulting viral particles were collected and titrated in

419

VeroE6 cells by enzyme luminescence assay (Britelite plus kit; PerkinElmer), as described

420

previously [81].

421

Lung tissue

422

Lung tissues were obtained from patients without previous COVID-19 history and a recent

423

negative PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection undergoing thoracic surgical resection at the

424

Thoracic Surgery Service of the Vall d’Hebron University Hospital. Study protocol was approved

425

by the Ethical Committee (Institutional Review Board number PR(AG)212/2020). Non-neoplastic

426

tissue areas were collected in antibiotic-containing RPMI 1640 and immediately dissected into

427

approximately 8-mm3 blocks. These blocks were first enzymatically digested with 5 mg/ml

428

collagenase IV (Gibco) and 100 µg/ml of DNase I (Roche) for 30 min at 37ºC and 400 rpm and,

429

then, mechanically digested with a pestle. The resulting cellular suspension was filtered through

430

a 70µm-pore size cell strainer (Labclinics) and washed twice with PBS. Pellet recovered after

431

centrifugation was resuspended in fresh medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, 100

432

U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin) and DNase I to dissolve cell aggregates, and the

433

resulting cell suspension was then filtered through a 40µm-pore size cell strainer (Labclinics).

434

Cell number and viability were assessed with LUNA™ Automated Cell Counter (Logos

435

Biosystems). For cell phenotyping the following antibodies were used: anti-CD31 (PerCP-Cy5.5,

436

BioLegend), anti-CD11b (FITC, BioLegend), anti-CD11c (Pe-Cy7, BD Biosciences), anti-E-cadherin

437

(Pe-CF594, BD Biosciences), primary goat anti-ACE2 (R&D systems), anti-CD14 (APC-H7, BD

438

Biosciences), anti-CD45 (AF700, BioLegend), anti-EpCAM (APC, BioLegend), anti-CD3 (BV650, BD

439

Biosciences), anti-CD15 (BV605, BD Biosciences) and anti-HLA-DR (BV421, BioLegend). For ACE2

440

detection, after surface staining, cells were stained with secondary donkey anti-goat IgG (PE,

441

R&D Systems) for 30 min at 4 ºC. Cell viability was determined using an AQUA viability dye for

442

flow cytometry (LIVE/DEAD fixable AQUA, Invitrogen). In some experiments, instead of CD11b

443

or CD15, we used a primary rabbit anti-TMPRSS2 or anti-CD147 (BV605, BD Biosciences),

444

respectively. For TMPRSS2 detection, after ACE2 staining with the appropriate secondary

445

antibody, cells were washed twice with PBS 1% NMS (normal mouse serum) and then stained

446

with a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (AF488, Thermofisher) for 30 min at 4ºC. After fixation

447

with PBS 2% PFA, cells were acquired in an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences), and data were

448

analyzed using the FlowJo v10.6.1 software (TreeStar).

449

Cytospin and alkaline phosphatase staining

450

Cytospin preparations were obtained from freshly isolated human lung cells at an

451

approximate density of 150,000 cells/slide, and air-dried during 15 min. Cells were stained with

452

alkaline phosphatase, as an enzyme marking epithelial type II cells, following manufacturer’s

453

instructions (Alkaline phosphatase Kit, Sigma). The intensity of pink stain reflects the amount of

454

alkaline phosphatase in positive cells.

455

ACE2 immunohistochemical staining in human lung tissue sections

456

Human lungs were maintained in 10% formalin for 24 hours and then embedded in paraffin.

457

Paraffin-embedded lungs were cut into 4 µm sections. After removing the paraffin, endogenous

458

peroxidases were inactivated in an aqueous solution containing 3% H2O2 and 10% methanol and

459

antigen retrieval was performed heating the samples in citrate buffer (10mM citric acid, pH 6.0).

460

The sections were then blocked in bovine serum albumin (5%), incubated with anti-ACE2

461

antibody (R&D Systems cat. nº AF933, dilution 1:100) and with biotinylated secondary antibody

462

against goat IgGs (Vector Laboratories cat. nº BA-9500, dilution 1:250). Proteins were visualized

463

using the ABC Peroxidase Standard Staining Kit (ThermoFisher) followed by 3,3′-

464

Diaminobenzidine (DAB) Enhanced Liquid Substrate System (Sigma Aldrich). Counterstaining

465

was done with hematoxylin.

466

Antiviral screening assay

467

The complete list of compounds tested in this study, including information about its clinical

468

use, product reference and vendors is shown in Table S1. Duplicates of five-fold serial dilutions

469

of 39 antiviral compounds were tested in both VeroE6 cell line and in human lung tissue (HLT)

470

cells using at least 2 different donors. For VeroE6, five-fold serial dilutions of the compounds,

471

ranging from 100µM to 0,25nM, were prepared in D10 in a 96-well flat-bottom plates. VeroE6

472

cells were added at a density of 30.000 cells/well and incubated with the drug for at least 1 h

473

before infection. Subsequently, cells were infected with 1,500 TCID50 of VSV*ΔG(Luc)-S virus. In

474

parallel, drug cytotoxicity was monitored by luminescence. To evaluate the antiviral activity of

475

drugs in HLT cells, five-fold serial dilutions of the compounds, ranging from 100µM to 0.8µM or

476

6.4nM, were prepared in R10 in a 96-well conic bottom plates. HLT cells were added at a density

477

of 300,000 cells/well and incubated with the compound for at least 1h before infection. Then,

478

MOI 0,1 of VSV*ΔG(Luc)-S virus were added to wells, and plates were spinoculated at 1,200g

479

and 37ºC for 2h. After infection, fresh medium was added to the wells and cell suspensions were

480

transferred into a 96-well round-bottom plate. Cells were then cultured overnight at 37°C in a

481

5% CO2 incubator. Each plate contained the following controls: no cells (background control),

482

cells treated with medium (mock infection) and cells infected but untreated (infection control).

483

After 20h, cells were incubated with Britelite plus reagent (Britelite plus kit; PerkinElmer) and

484

then transferred to an opaque black plate. Luminescence was immediately recorded by a

485

luminescence plate reader (LUMIstar Omega). To evaluate cytotoxicity, we used the CellTiter-

486

Glo® Luminescent kit (Promega), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Data was

487

normalized to the mock-infected control, after which EC50 and CC50 values were calculated using

488

Graph-Pad Prism 7.

489

Modulation of ACE2 expression by anti-inflammatory drugs and immune stimuli

490

VeroE6 and lung cells were incubated with five-fold serial dilutions of selected anti-

491

inflammatory compounds (ranging from 100µM to 0.8µM) for 20h. Tested drugs included

492

cortisol, ibuprofen, prednisone and dexamethasone. Lung cells were also incubated with the

493

following cytokines: GM-CSF (100 ng/ml, Immunotools), IL-1β (10 ng/ml, Immunotools), IL-10

494

(100 ng/ml, Immunotools), IFN-β (100 U/ml, Immunotools), or IFN-α2 (100 U/ml, Sigma Aldrich).

495

For determination of ACE2 expression, the following surface staining antibodies were used:

496

primary goat anti-ACE2 (R&D Systems), anti-CD45 (AF700, BioLegend), anti-EpCAM (APC,

497

BioLegend), and anti-HLA-DR (BV421, BioLegend). For ACE2 detection, cells were then stained

498

with secondary donkey anti-goat IgG (PE, R&D Systems) for 30 min at 4 ºC. A Fluorescent Minus

499

One control (FMO) without primary anti-ACE2 antibody was used as a control. Cell viability was

500

determined using an AQUA viability dye for flow cytometry (LIVE/DEAD fixable AQUA,

501

Invitrogen). After fixation with PBS 2% PFA, cells were acquired in an LSR Fortessa (BD

502

Biosciences) and analyzed using the FlowJo v10.6.1 software (TreeStar).

503

Immunomodulatory capacity of selected drugs

504

HLT cells were cultured in a round-bottom 96-well plate containing 20 μM of cepharanthine,

505

ergoloid mesylate, ciclesonide, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, or camostat mesylate alone or

506

in combination with the stimuli LPS (50 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (100 ng/ml). For each patient, a

507

negative control, cells treated with only medium, and a positive control, cells incubated in the

508

presence of LPS and IFN-γ, were included. Immediately, brefeldin A (BD Biosciences) and

509

monensin (BD Biosciences) were added to cells and cultured overnight at 37 ºC in 5% CO2. Next

day, cellular suspensions were stained with the following antibodies: anti-CD11b (FITC,

511

BioLegend), anti-CD69 (PE-CF594, BD Biosciences), anti-CD14 (APC-H7, BD Biosciences), anti-

512

EpCAM (APC, BioLegend), anti-CD3 (BV650, BD Biosciences), anti-CD45 (BV605, BioLegend), and

513

anti-HLA-DR (BV421, BioLegend). Cells were subsequently fixed and permeabilized using the

514

Cytofix/Cytoperm™ kit (BD Biosciences) and intracellularly stained with anti-IL-6 (PE-Cy7,

515

BioLegend), and anti-CXCL10 (PE, BioLegend). Cell viability was determined using an AQUA

516

viability dye for flow cytometry (LIVE/DEAD fixable AQUA, Invitrogen). After fixation with PBS

517

2% PFA, cells were acquired in an LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using

518

the FlowJo v10.6.1 software (TreeStar).

519

Statistical analyses

520

Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software, version 6.0 (GraphPad). A P value

521

<0.05 was considered significant.

epithelial cells, AT-II cells (EpCAM+ and HLA-DR+, pink) were identified. Out of live CD45+ cells

825

and based on FSC vs. SSC, we identified a lymphocyte population in which we distinguished

826

between non-T lymphocytes (turquoise) and T cells (dark green) based on CD3 expression; and

827

big cells, where we identified three major subsets based on their expression of CD11b and CD11c
