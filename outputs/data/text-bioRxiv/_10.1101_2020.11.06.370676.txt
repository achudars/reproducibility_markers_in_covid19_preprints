ABSTRACT

32

Combinatorial antibody libraries not only effectively reduce antibody discovery to a

33

numbers game, but enable documentation of the history of antibody responses in an

34

individual. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted a wider application of this

35

technology to meet the public health challenge of pandemic threats in the modern era.

36

Herein, we used a combinatorial human antibody library constructed 20 years before the

37

COVID-19 pandemic to discover three highly potent antibodies that selectively bind

38

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. Compared to

39

neutralizing antibodies from COVID-19 patients with generally low somatic hypermutation

40

(SHM), these antibodies contain over 13-22 SHMs, many of which are involved in specific

41

interactions in crystal structures with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD. The identification of these

42

somatically mutated antibodies in a pre-pandemic library raises intriguing questions about

43

the origin and evolution of human immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

45

The global spread of SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus and cause of the coronavirus

46

disease 2019 (COVID-19), poses an unprecedented health crisis and was declared a

47

pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 (1). To date, over 40

48

million individuals have been infected with over 1 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/)

49

with no vaccines or specific antiviral drugs yet approved. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)

50

targeting the viral spike glycoprotein (S) have been shown to have excellent neutralization

51

efficacy in previous treatment of SARS, MERS and Ebola infections, and therefore are of

52

particular interest to combat the current pandemic (2, 3). Since the COVID-19 outbreak,

53

the spike glycoprotein has been the main target for development of therapeutic mAbs (4,

54

5). Most neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) bind to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the

55

S protein (6), although some also bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) (7, 8). NAbs have

56

been derived from multiple sources, including memory B cells from SARS-CoV-2

57

convalescent patients (3, 9, 10), previous SARS patients (11), immunized humanized

58

H2L2 mice (12), alpaca nanobodies (13), single domain human antibodies from a pre-

59

established library (14), and phage display antibody libraries (4, 15, 16).

60

Antibody generation is an evolutionary process of mutation and selection from the B cell

61

repertoire. The combinatorial antibody library technology allows the same evolutionary

62

process to be performed in vitro as it restores the "fossil record" of an individual's antibody

63

response in a test tube (17). Random coupling of VH and VL sequences in scFv libraries

64

greatly expands diversity, thereby allowing for selection of novel antibodies with high

65

binding affinity and neutralization efficacy (18-22).

66

Here, we report the selection and characterization of three potent SARS-CoV-2 antibodies,

67

S-E6, S-B8 and S-D4, from a pre-pandemic human combinatorial antibody library

68

established in 1999 that target the spike RBD and compete with hACE2 receptor (23).

69

This study provides further evidence that a combinatorial antibody library with an

70

unprecedented diversity can mimic the selection process of natural immunity, permit

71

detection of rare spike-targeting antibodies with higher somatic hypermutation, and allow

72

for selection of binding molecules with chemistries beyond those accessible during in vivo

73

selection.

74

RESULTS

75

Selection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD

76

We constructed and overexpressed the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (S-RBD) linked to

77

human Fc (hFc) with a thrombin digestion site. After affinity purification, recombinant

78

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was biotinylated, immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic

79

beads, and panned against a combinatorial scFv antibody phage library containing 1011

80

members generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 50 healthy

81

donors in 1999 (23, 24). In the first two rounds, a pH 2.2 glycine-HCl solution was used

82

to elute antibody-displaying phagemids bound to S-RBD. To enrich for antibodies that

83

compete with hACE2, a “function-guided enrichment” strategy was used in the third round,

84

where recombinant hACE2-ECD protein was used to elute S-RBD binding phagemids.

85

After three rounds of panning, S-RBD-specific antibodies were enriched (Figure 1A) and

86

22 unique antibodies were selected that specifically bound to S-RBD-hFc (Figure 1B) (24).

87

Next-generation sequencing of the library revealed that 92% of human heavy-chain IGHV

88

and 89% of the light-chain (IGLV and IGKV) germlines were covered, when aligned to the

89

IMGT (international ImMunoGeneTics) database (Supplementary Figure 1), enabling

90

screening of antibodies encoded by diverse germlines.

91

Selected anti-S-RBD antibodies retain binding to full-length spike

92

The scFv antibodies were then converted to full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) by

93

cloning into a human IgG4e1(S228P) vector. HEK293F cells were adapted for expression

94

of combinatorial antibodies that were secreted into culture supernatants (24). Three of

95

the best performing antibodies, S-B8, S-D4 and S-E6, were purified to homogeneity with

96

yields of 8.1, 9.6 and 17 mg/L, respectively, whereas S-RBD-hFc (IgG1) was 58 mg/L

97

(Supplementary Figures 2 & 3). To characterize interactions between the anti-S-RBD

98

antibodies and full-length spike, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with either

99

SARS-CoV-2 spike-P2A-EGFP or SARS spike-P2A-EGFP (24). Flow cytometry (FACS)

100

showed that all three antibodies in full-length-IgG4 format retained their ability to bind full-

101

length SARS-CoV-2 spike (Figure 2A & 2D) with no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV spike

102

(Figure 2B) or non-transfected cells (Figure 2C).

103

Antibody binding and competition with hACE2-ECD to SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

104

To assess neutralization potential of the mAbs, we investigated their ability to compete

105

with ACE2-ECD for S-RBD binding by ELISA (15, 25). S-B8, S-D4 and S-E6 all competed

106

strongly with hACE2-ECD in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 12.9±1.5 nM,

107

7.1±0.4 nM, and 12.2±0.7 nM, respectively (Figure 3A). Kinetic parameters of on-rate

108

(kon), off-rate (koff), and dissociation constant (KD) for the three antibodies were then

109

determined by biolayer interferometry (Figure 3B – 3E). S-B8, S-D4, and S-E6 showed

110

KD values of 170 pM, 10 pM and 110 pM, respectively, with S-D4 displaying the highest

111

affinity due to its greatly reduced off-rate (Figure 3C).

112

We also tested with natural mutants of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins that have been

113

clinically associated with more severe illness and longer hospital stays. Three mutants,

114

i.e. D215H (mut 1), S247R (mut 2) and D614G (mut 3), isolated from patients requiring

115

treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) (26), all displayed similar binding by FACS to S-

116

B8, S-D4, and S-E6 (Supplementary Figure 4), indicating their therapeutic potential

117

against natural SARS-CoV-2 spike mutants in severely affected patients.

118

Inhibition of cell-cell fusion induced by SARS-CoV-2 spike and hACE2

119

The S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike mediates membrane fusion in hACE2

120

expressing cells and is essential for virus infection. hACE2 binding to SARS-CoV-2 is

121

stronger than to the SARS-CoV spike (KD of 4.7 nM and 32 nM, respectively) (27). To test

122

whether these antibodies could inhibit spike-mediated membrane fusion of cells, we

123

established a cell-cell fusion assay using Vero cells overexpressing hACE2 as target cells,

124

SARS-CoV-2 spike-P2A-EGFP transient transfected HEK293F cells as effector cells, and

125

SARS-CoV spike-P2A-EGFP cells as a negative control (24). Spike-expressing HEK293F

126

cells were mixed with S-B8, S-D4 or S-E6 at 10 nM or 1 nM just before adding to the Vero

127

cells and syncytium formation observed 6 hours later. The SARS-CoV-2 spike induced

128

significant cell-cell fusion as manifested by formation of larger EGFP positive cells,

129

whereas the SARS-CoV spike barely induced syncytium formation (Figure 4A). All three

130

antibodies potently inhibited cell-cell fusion by SARS-CoV-2 at both 10 and 1 nM (Figure

131

4B, 4C & 4F). At 10 nM, S-D4 and S-E6 showed over 80% inhibition of cell-cell fusion,

132

which was slightly greater than recombinant S-RBD; S-D4 and S-E6 were more potent

133

than S-B8 at 1 and 10 nM (Figure 4D & 4E).

134

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic virus

135

To test neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 virus, we assessed the antibodies in a

136

pseudovirus (PSV) infection assay. Pseudotyped particles were pre-incubated with S-B8

137

and S-D4 (from 200 nM to 200 fM) and S-E6 (200 nM to 6.3 fM), followed by infection of

138

HEK293T/hACE2 cells (24). Luciferase activity resulting from infection was determined

139

at 60 h post transfection. All three antibodies showed potent neutralization against PSV

140

infection in a dose-dependent manner that went to completion. The NT50 values of S-B8,

141

S-D4, and S-E6 in pseudovirus neutralization were determined to be 2.2±0.2 nM,

142

0.48±0.03 nM, and 0.025±0.002 nM, respectively (Figure 5A) in a 1:1 interaction model

143

with HillSlopes near 1.0 (Figure 5B). We next tested antibody neutralization of authentic

144

SARS-CoV-2

145

(Victoria/01/2020)] (24). Twenty hours after infection, intracellular virus was visualized

146

and quantitated as percent infectivity. S-D4 and S-E6 were capable of fully blocking

147

infection by authentic virus, while S-B8 was less potent (Figure 5C) with NT50 values for

148

S-B8, S-D4 and S-E6 of 16 nM, 0.7±0.08 nM and 0.25±0.05 nM, respectively (Figure 5D).

149

S-B8 and S-E6 bind the RBD and sterically block ACE2 binding

150

To elucidate the molecular recognition of S-B8 and S-E6 for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, x-ray

151

structures of Fab/RBD complexes were determined to 2.25 and 2.70 Å, respectively

152

153

different approach angles (Figure 6A) and sterically compete with ACE2 for RBD binding,

154

consistent with the competition assay (Figure 3A). S-B8 interacts mainly using its heavy

155

chain, which contributes 73% of the buried surface area (BSA, 737 of 1010 Å2) (Figure

156

6B) and 12 of 16 polar contacts (Supplementary Table 2). S-E6 predominately uses its

157

light chain, which contributes 63% of the BSA (530 of 847 Å2) and 16 of 19 polar contacts

158

(Supplementary Table 2). Light chain dominant interactions are less common in

159

antibodies (28, 29).

160

IgBLAST analysis (30) suggests S-B8 is derived from IGHV3-66, a germline that is

161

highly similar to IGHV3-53 (Supplementary

162

IGHV3-53 antibodies from convalescent patients, with minimal SHM and high potency,

163

have two key germline motifs in CDRH1 and CDRH2 that are primarily used for

164

recognition of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, namely

165

two very distinct binding modes (A and B) are observed for IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies

depending on CDRH3 length (31-33). However, in S-B8, 32NY33 in CDRH1 is mutated to

175

F486 in the S-RBD ridge region is buried in a hydrophobic pocket (VH W47, VH I50, VL

176

Y91, VL L94, VL L96) between the heavy and light chains, while 485GF486 and 476GS477 on

177

the RBD ridge interact with VH Y52 and VL Y27d via π-π interactions (Figure 6D). Of note,

178

F486 is also buried in a pocket at the heavy-light chain interface in COVA2-39, which is

179

an IGHV3-53 antibody, as well as other antibodies that bind in RBS-B mode (34).

180

Altogether, 19 of 29 S-B8 epitope residues are shared with 19 of 21 COVA2-39 epitope

181

residues, with16 corresponding to ACE2 binding residues (Supplementary Figure 8).

182

S-E6 interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

183

S-E6 is an IGHV4-31 antibody. Interestingly, SHM introduces a

184

similar position to the

185

(Supplementary

186

orientation compared to 32NY33 of IGHV3-53 binding mode A (34). Nevertheless, VH N33

187

still hydrogen bonds with RBD A475 carbonyl (Figure 6E), as does VH N32 of IGHV3-53

188

in binding mode A (Figure 6F). VH Y34 and VH A97 form two hydrogen bonds with N487

189

of the S-RBD (Figure 6E), which differ from Y33 in IGHV3-53 antibodies (Figure 6F). F486,

190

along with N487, interact with a hydrophobic pocket formed by VH Y34, A97, H101 and

191

I102 of S-E6 and also make π-π and cation-π interactions (Figure 6E). However, the S-E6

192

light chain contributes the majority of the buried surface with RBD. CDRL2

193

interact with the receptor binding motif (RBM) via multiple polar interactions (8 hydrogen

194

bonds and 3 salt bridges) to E484, F490, L492, Q493 and S494 (Figure 6G,

195

Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, VL F50 interacts with a nearby hydrophobic patch

196

formed by L455, F456 and Y489 (Figure 6G), and VL S27, G29, S67 and G68 form five

hydrogen bonds with R403, N501 and Y505 on the other side of the RBS ridge (Figure

198

6H, Supplementary Table 2).

199

SHM residues form specific interactions with the RBD

200

Unlike most RBD-targeting neutralizing antibodies isolated from COVID-19 patients which

201

have minimal SHM, the antibodies derived from this combinatorial antibody library are

202

more highly mutated; S-B8 and S-E6 contain 13 and 22 SHM residues, respectively,

203

several of which are in the antibody paratope (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure 6),

204

including VH

205

N33, VL V39, VL 50FDYR53 and 65TR66 in S-E6 (Figure 6, C – G, and Supplementary Figure

206

6). In summary, several SHM residues appear to be critical for interaction with SARS-

207

CoV-2 RBD, despite the antibody libraries being generated 20 years ago, implying the

208

possibility that the eliciting antigen was structurally very similar to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

209

or there is rare but fortuitous cross-reactivity with another antigen.

210

Antibody autoreactivity

211

To investigate the origin of the three antibodies, a HEp-2 autoreactivity assay was

212

performed. Neither S-D4 nor S-E6 showed a positive signal in the assay, suggesting that

213

they are not derived from auto-immune responses (Supplementary Figure 9, A & B),

214

whereas S-B8 displayed weak to moderate autoreactivity (Supplementary Figure 9C).

215

We further generated an S-B8 putative germline antibody, by mutating back all of the

216

SHMs in the S-B8 heavy chain to the naïve IGHV3-66 sequence. The mutated antibody

217

showed greater autoreactivity than S-B8 (Supplementary Figure 9D) and no S-RBD

218

binding up to 12.5 nM (Supplementary Figure 10).

DISCUSSION

220

For over a century, serology has been used to document the origin and presence of

221

infectious agents in patients. Classically, serology depends on the actual presence of

222

specific antibody proteins in the blood. Their target is thought to be the infectious agent,

223

and their presence indicates a relatively recent exposure. By contrast, antibody libraries

224

are nucleic acid based, and include genetic material from memory cells. As such, they

225

provide a record of all of the antibodies that an individual has made, irrespective of

226

whether they are currently being produced. This “fossil record” enabled us to discover

227

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies induced either by previous infection or from other

228

immune responses. Furthermore, combinatorial antibody libraries typically yield more

229

diverse antibodies with the desired specificity. Here, the presence of many somatic

230

mutations in the antibodies indicates a sustained drive of the immune response to

231

continued presence of a foreign antigen, as occurs during virus replication. Thus, the

232

modern serology detailed here suggests that one of the individuals from whom the library

233

was generated could have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or a similar virus.

234

Although the antibody library used here was established in 1999 before the SARS and

235

COVID-19 pandemics (23), three potent neutralizing antibodies were discovered in this

236

library. Wec et al. (4) identified several S-RBD-directed antibodies that potently cross-

237

neutralize SARS-CoV (IC50: 0.004-0.06 μg/mL to pseudovirus) and SARS-CoV-2 (IC50:

238

0.05-1.4 μg/mL to pseudovirus) from memory B cells of a SARS donor. They also found

239

over 80% of the low affinity SARS and SARS-2 cross-reactive antibodies reacted with

240

one or more of the human coronavirus spike proteins, such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E,

241

HCoV-OC43, etc., indicating SARS-CoV infection may have boosted a pre-existing

242

memory B cell response induced by circulating HCoVs (4). Interestingly, the three

243

antibodies, S-B8, S-E6 and S-D4, identified in this study do not cross-react with the SARS

244

spike protein. Moreover, autoreactivity assay in a HEp-2 cell ruled out that S-E6 and S-

245

D4 originate from autoimmune responses, whereas S-B8 showed weak to moderate

246

autoreactivity (Supplementary Figure 9, A – C), which was increased in the S-B8 putative

247

germline antibody (Supplementary Figure 9D).

248

Our structural studies on S-E6 and S-B8 revealed several striking features of these

249

combinatorial antibodies. The primary immune response to viral infection is followed by a

250

secondary response that generates functionally better antibodies, where the binding

251

energy can be refined by somatic hypermutation (18). The secondary immune response

252

is for later encounter of the same antigen, and is the basis of vaccination. In cases of

253

pandemics, such as SARS-CoV-2, avian influenza or Ebola virus, if the infection is not

254

dealt with by the immune system in the first few days, the patient has a high probability

255

of dying, and as a consequence, the immune system will not have enough time to refine

256

the immune response (35). Consistently, neutralizing antibodies isolated from SARS-

257

CoV-2 convalescent patients contain only a few amino-acid mutations (3, 8, 9, 36, 37).

258

that may be a result of weak B cell stimulation due to rapid viral clearance. Neutralizing

259

antibodies from convalescent patients may then possibly not be fully refined (matured)

260

(36). In comparison, S-B8 and S-E6 exhibited much higher SHM, many of which are

261

involved in specific interactions with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (S-RBD). Nine of 13 SHM

262

residues in S-B8 and eight of 22 in S-E6 are located in the antibody-antigen interface

263

(Supplementary Figure 6). While some of these SHM residues only use their peptide

264

backbone, others rely on specific side chains for S-RBD binding (Figure 6, C, D, E & G).

265

Interestingly, SHM in CDRH1 of S-E6 generates a 33NY34 sequence that is similar to the

266

32NY33

267

targeting the S-RBD, indicative that the combinatorial antibody library and the maturation

268

process can yield alternate antibody solutions (Supplementary Figure 6). However, it is

269

unclear how these SHM residues could have been raised specifically to the SARS-CoV-

270

2 S-RBD, since the library was generated long before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Thus,

271

these findings raise fascinating questions about the original antigen(s) that elicited S-B8

272

and S-E6.

motif in IGHV3-53/3-66 antibodies, which are the most frequent germlines used in

273

The unnaturally paired antibodies in a combinatorial scFv antibody library also allow

274

one to identify other alternative solutions with high binding affinity and efficacy (18). Rare

275

germline antibodies can then potentially be enriched during the iterative affinity panning,

276

as for example for S-E6, which is an IGHV4-31 antibody rarely seen in neutralizing

277

antibodies from convalescent patients (Supplementary Figure 11).

278

A general question posed by these studies is whether therapies based on the vast

279

number of starting antibodies in combinatorial libraries could be more powerful than the

280

antibodies generated in vivo during the limited time available for affinity-based antibody

281

evolution and selection in the setting of an acute and potentially lethal infection. This also

282

has direct relevance in the clinical setting, where a major concern in antibody therapy is

283

the high mutation rate of viral spike proteins, which can render prior highly specific

284

antibodies unable to recognize or neutralize mutant viruses. Mixtures of antibodies

285

targeting distinct epitopes can be used to overcome such immune escape (38).

286

Antibodies identified from combinatorial libraries with high SHM and rare germline

287

derivation, in combination with antibodies from convalescent patients, or with

288

convalescent plasma, could provide yet another therapeutic option and a potential

289

antidote to immune escape. Knowledge of the evolution of immune response in terms of

290

the interactions of neutralizing antibodies and their binding epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 also

291

provide a blueprint for next-generation vaccine design.

292

Since a complete antibody repertoire of an individual is the starting reservoir of all

293

possibilities, one can also learn much more about the origins and evolution of an immune

294

response against viral challenge when it is studied (18). The observation of highly potent

295

neutralizing antibodies from a library of “healthy” donors before the COVID-19 pandemic

296

could also indicate possible prior exposure of a donor(s) to a similar coronavirus 20 years

297

ago. However, whether these antibodies are a consequence of background immunity

298

remains to be elucidated. Notwithstanding, we are not unaware of the potential

299

implications of such findings from libraries made decades ago concerning the origin of

300

the virus currently circulating.

302

Cell culture

303

The Vero cell line (ATCC® CCL-81™) was maintained in a DMEM/F-12k media (Gibco,

304

#C11330500CP) containing 10% (v/v) FBS (Gibco, #1600074). The FreeStyle™ 293-F

306

expression media (ThermoFisher Scientific, #12338026). For establishing the

307

HEK293T/hACE2 stable cell line, HEK293T cells (ATCC® ACS-4500™) were transiently

308

transfected with hACE2 fusion BFP encoding PB510 plasmid using PiggyBac Transposon

309

System (System Biosciences, PB210PA-1), followed by addition of 2 μg/mL puromycin 6

310

h post-transfection. The resulting cells were kept in puromycin-containing media for an

311

extra 2 days. Positive cells with BFP expression were sorted by a flow cytometry

312

instrument (BD FACS Aria III). The sorted cells with overexpressed hACE2 were

313

expanded and cultured in a DMEM media (Gibco, #10566016) supplemented with 10%

314

FBS (v/v) and 10 μg/mL puromycin.

315

Expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, human ACE2

316

and antibodies

317

The DNA sequences of codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike Receptor Binding Domain

318

(S-RBD) and human ACE2 extracellular domain (hACE2-ECD) were cloned into a pFuse-

319

Fc expression vector (Invivogen). A thrombin cleavage sequence was inserted between

320

RBD and Fc to generate a cleavable human Fc tag for future studies. The SARS-CoV-2

321

S-RBD-hFc and hACE2-ECD-mFc proteins were heterologously expressed in HEK293F

322

cells by transient transfection and cultured for 4 days, then purified by Mabselect columns

323

(Cytiva, #17-5199-01). Briefly, cell media with secreted Fc tagged recombinant proteins,

324

S-RBD-hFc and hACE2-ECD-mFc, were loaded onto a Mabselect column that was pre-

325

washed and equilibrated with a PBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH

326

7.2), and eluted using a pH 3.4 citrate acid buffer.

327

DNA sequences for the variable regions of the combinatorial antibodies were cloned

into a full-length human IgG4 mutant construct (S228P) and expressed in HEK293F cells

329

for 4 days and further purified by Mabselect chromatography. Purified recombinant

330

proteins and antibodies were buffer-exchanged into a PBS buffer using centrifugal

331

concentrators.

332

Function-guided phage panning

333

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD specific scFv antibodies were selected from a combinatorial human

334

monoclonal scFv antibody phage library (1011 members) after two rounds of affinity

335

enrichment against the biotinylated S-RBD protein immobilized on the streptavidin-coated

336

magnetic beads (Pierce, #21925), followed by a third round of competitive panning vs.

337

hACE2-ECD protein. Briefly, phagemid (displaying the antibody library) binding to the

338

antigen (S-RBD) was enriched at each cycle and eluted with Glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) in the

339

first two rounds of screening. XL1-Blue cells were used to express and amplify the output

340

phagemids for the next round of panning. To determine hACE2 competitive antibodies, a

341

kinetic competitive panning method was adopted in the third round panning. Instead of

342

the conventional pH 2.2 buffer, an elution buffer containing a saturated concentration of

343

hACE2-ECD protein (200 nM; for S-RBD and hACE2-ECD binding, EC80 = 80 nM) was

344

used to elute the phagemids twice. After three iterations, 96 positive colonies were

345

selected and analyzed by phage ELISA as described (39). All of the positive clones were

346

sequenced using Sanger sequencing. Both the DNA and protein sequences of CDR3

347

domains were analyzed using the international ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) information

348

platform (http://www.imgt.org/).

350

Avidin (Pierce, #21121) was diluted to a final concentration of 2 ng/μL in a PBS buffer

351

(Sigma, #C3041). The resulting avidin solution was used to coat the 96-half well plates

352

(25 μL/well) at 4 °C overnight. The coated plates were washed once with the PBS buffer

353

(150 μL/well) followed by the addition and incubation of 25 μL biotinylated SARS-CoV-2

354

S-RBD-hFc solution (2 ng/μL) in each well at room temperature for 1 h. The PBST (PBS

355

containing 0.05% Tween-20) buffer alone and the hFc solution (2 ng/μL) were used as

356

the background and negative controls, respectively. After removal of the incubation

357

solution, the resulting plates were rinsed once using the PBST buffer and incubated with

358

a blocking solution containing 5% milk (v/v) in PBST (150 μL/well) at 37 °C for 1 h. After

359

blocking and PBST washing (once), 50 μL of phagemid-containing XL1-Blue culture

360

medium supernatants (by centrifuging the third round panning output XL1-Blue cells at

361

3000 g, 15 min) mixed with 10 μL 5% milk (v/v) in PBST was added to each well and

362

incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The resulting plates were rinsed eight times using PBST before

subjecting to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) detection. A solution containing the

364

secondary antibody, anti-M13 bacteriophage antibody conjugated with HRP (dilution

365

factor 1 : 5000; Sino Biological, #11973-MM05T-H), was added into the above plates (150

366

μL/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were then washed eight times with PBST

367

followed by the addition of 50 μL ABTS solution (Roche, #11684302001) into each well.

368

After ~10 min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance change at 405 nm in each

369

well was measured on a microplate reader (Enspire, PerkinElmer).

spike protein RBD was measured. The recombinant hACE2-ECD was coated in PBS

373

buffer at 2 ng/μL, 100 μL per well at 4 °C overnight, washed with PBS once, then blocked

374

with 3% BSA in PBS. Biotinylated S-RBD (hFc tag removed by thrombin digestion) at a

375

final concentration of 50 nM was incubated with 2-fold serial diluted S-B8, S-D4, and S-

376

E6 antibodies (from 1 - 133 nM) at 4 °C for 30 min, in which an IgG4e1 isotype antibody

377

was used as the negative control. The S-RBD and antibody mixture was then added to

378

the hACE2-ECD coated plates and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 4

379

washes with PBST. The hACE2-ECD bound S-RBD in the plate was detected using a

380

Streptavidin-HRP conjugated protein.

381

Affinity determination by Biolayer Interferometry (BLI)

382

Binding affinities of S-D4 with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were performed by BLI on an Octet

383

RED96 (Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, CA, USA) using AR2G biosensors. The

384

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD fused hFc was first digested by thrombin to remove the Fc tag. The

385

resulting S-RBD diluted in a PBS solution containing 0.02% Tween-20 and 0.05% BSA

386

(PBST-B) (10 µg/mL) was loaded to the AR2G biosensor by amine coupling. The AR2G-

387

S-RBD sensors were dipped into a PBST-B for 60 sec to establish a baseline, and then

388

incubated with 2-fold serial diluted antibody solutions to record the progressive curves of

389

association. Finally, sensors were incubated in a PBST-B buffer to record the progressive

390

curves of dissociation. For S-B8 and S-E6 detections, S-RBD was first biotinylated before

391

loading to a streptavidin (SA) sensor, the remaining procedure was same to that of S-D4.

Interaction of antibodies with cell surface expressed spike by FACS

396

In a flow-cytometry binding experiment, the spike protein of either full-length SARS-CoV-

397

2 or SARS, which was conjugated with P2A-EGFP, was transiently transfected into a

398

HEK293T cell. After 24 h cultivation, cells were collected and re-suspended in an ice-cold

399

FACS buffer (PBS, 0.05 % BSA and 2 mM EDTA). The spike protein expressing cells

400

(50000 cells per tube) were then incubated with different anti-S-RBD antibodies for 20

401

min at 4 °C, and washed with 1 mL ice-cold FACS buffer, spun, and re-suspended in a

402

100 μL ice-cold FACS buffer containing the Alexa555 conjugated secondary antibody that

403

recognizes human Fc (1 : 800 v/v dilution, Life technology, # A21433). After incubating at

404

4 °C for 15 min, the cells were washed twice and re-suspended in a FACS buffer, and

405

then sorted and analyzed on a flow cytometer (CytoFLEX S, Beckman Culter) to

406

determine relative binding level by the antibodies to the cell overexpressing wild-type

407

spikes. Mean fluorescence intensities of Alexa555 in eGFP-positive cells were recorded

408

and analyzed to evaluate antibody binding.

Cell-cell fusion assay

416

The cell-cell fusion assay was established according to a previous report (40) with minor

417

modifications. Briefly, hACE2 positive Vero cells (cells with endogenous hACE2 were

418

sorted by FACS) were used as target cells. HEK293F cells that are transiently transfected

419

with either SARS-CoV-2 spike-P2A-EGFP or SARS spike-P2A-EGFP were set as effector

420

cells. The target Vero cells were first seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1×105/well

421

and cultivated at 37 °C for 4 h, followed by addition of effector cells, HEK293F/SARS

422

spike-EGFP or HEK293F/SARS-CoV-2 spike-EGFP, at a ratio of 2:1, respectively. The

423

co-cultures of cells were cultivated in a DMEM medium with 10% FBS, and treated with

424

or without anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies at indicated concentrations. The

425

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was used as a positive control. After cultivating at

426

37 °C for 6 h, the rates of cell-cell fusion were evaluated using a fluorescence microscope

427

(EVOS M5000, Life Technologies). Five fields for microscopic analysis were randomly

428

selected in each treated group, the numbers of fused and unfused EGFP positive cells

429

were counted.

433

2 spike protein, with 19 AA truncated in C terminal) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen,

434

K), and mixed with the Lenti-X Concentrator (Takara, 631231) overnight at 4 °C. The

438

mixture was then centrifuged at 1500 g for 45 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were collected

439

and re-suspended in a DMEM medium and stored at -80 °C until use.

440

Pseudovirus-based neutralization assay

441

To detect the neutralization ability of selected antibodies against infection of coronavirus

442

pseudovirus (PSV), HEK293T/hACE2 cells were first seeded into 96-well white bottom

443

plates at a density of 1×104/well, and cultivated overnight. The PSV was pre-incubated

444

with an equal volume of different concentrations of selected antibodies (dilution factor:

445

3.16, from 200 nM to 200 fM for S-B8 and S-D4, 200 nM to 6.3 fM for S-E6) in DMEM at

446

37 °C for 30 min. DMEM with or without PSV in the absence of antibodies were set as

447

controls. After incubation, the PSV mixture was transferred to the culture plates containing

448

HEK293T/hACE2 cells. The DMEM media containing PSV and antibodies were replaced

449

with fresh media after 16 h treatment, cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. PSV

450

infection efficacy was evaluated by luciferase activity using Bright-Lumi™ Firefly

451

Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Beyotime, RG015M). Fifty microliter of luciferase

452

substrate was added to each well, and the relative luminescence unit (RLU) values were

453

measured on an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Ensight).

459

rapid, high-throughput assay determines the concentration of antibody that produces a

460

50% reduction in infectious focus-forming units of authentic SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells,

461

as follows. Quadruplicate, 0.5log10 serial dilutions of antibody (11 steps from 100 nM to 1

462

pM) were pre-incubated with a fixed dose of SARS-CoV-2 (Victoria 01/2020 isolate)

463

before incubation with Vero cells. A 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose-containing overlay was

464

used to prevent satellite focus formation. Twenty hours post-infection, the monolayers

465

were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 2% Triton X-100 and stained

466

for N antigen using mAb EY 2A (41). After development with a peroxidase-conjugated

467

antibody and True Blue peroxidase substrate, infectious foci were enumerated by

468

ELISPOT reader. Data were analyzed using four-parameter logistic regression (Hill

469

equation) in GraphPad Prism 8.3.

470

Autoreactivity assay

471

The autoreactivity assay was performed using a HEp-2 anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) kit

472

(Medical & Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd, #4220-12CN) according to the

473

manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 35 μL of 0.1 mg/mL antibodies were loaded to the

474

wells in a slide pre-seeded with fixed and permeabilized HEp-2 cells and incubated for 20

475

min at room temperature. Positive serum from autoimmune patients and negative serum

476

from healthy donors provided by the kit were used as controls. After washing twice (5 min

477

each), the FITC-conjugated secondary anti-human antibody was incubated with the cells

478

Protein production and structure determination

482

The coding sequence for receptor binding domain (RBD; residues 319-541) of the SARS-

483

CoV-2 spike (S) protein was synthesized and cloned into a customized pFastBac vector

484

(42), which was designed to fuse an N-terminal gp67 signal peptide and C-terminal His6-

485

tag to the target protein. To express the RBD protein, a recombinant bacmid DNA was

486

generated from the sequencing-confirmed pFastBac construct using the Bac-to-Bac

487

system (Life Technologies). Baculovirus was generated by transfecting purified bacmid

488

DNA into Sf9 cells using FuGENE HD (Promega), and subsequently used to infect

489

suspension cultures of High Five cells (Life Technologies) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)

490

of 5 to 10. Infected High Five cells were incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 110 rpm for

491

72 h for protein expression. RBD protein that was secreted into the supernatant,

492

harvested, and then concentrated with a 10 kDa MW cutoff Centramate cassette (Pall

493

Corporation). The RBD protein was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA resin

494

(QIAGEN), followed by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad Superdex 200 pg

495

column (GE Healthcare), and buffer exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 and 150 mM

496

NaCl using the same protocol as previously described (43). Fabs were expressed in

497

ExpiCHO cells and purified using CaptureSelect CH1-XL resin (ThermoFisher) and

498

followed by size exclusion chromatography. The Fab/RBD complexes were formed by

499

mixing the two components in an equimolar ratio and incubating overnight at 4 °C before

500

setting-up crystal trials. The Fab/RBD complexes were screened for crystallization using

501

384 conditions of the JCSG Core Suite (QIAGEN) on our robotic CrystalMation system

502

(Rigaku) at The Scripps Research Institute. Crystals appeared in the first week, were

503

harvested during the second week, and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for X-ray

504

diffraction experiments. Diffraction data were collected at cryogenic temperature (100 K)

505

at beamline 23-ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National

506

Laboratory with a beam wavelength of 1.033 Å and processed with HKL2000 (44).

507

Diffraction data were collected from crystals grown in conditions: 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M

508

sodium sulfate, pH 6.6 for S-B8/RBD complex; 20% isopropanol, 20% PEG 4000, 0.1 M

509

citrate pH 5.6 for S-E6/RBD complex. The X-ray structures were solved by molecular

510

replacement (MR) using PHASER (45) with MR models for the RBD and Fab from PDB

511

7JMW (46). Iterative model building and refinement were carried out in COOT (47) and

512

PHENIX (48), respectively. Epitope and paratope residues, as well as their interactions,

513

were identified by using PISA program (49) with buried surface area (BSA >0 Å2) as the

514

criterion.

515

Data analysis and statistics

516

The results were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise

517

indicated. Data analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using

518

Origin Pro 2019 statistical software or GraphPad Prism software. Significance was

519

assumed at a P value < 0.05.
