Abstract

Background

: This study aims to analyze the dynamics of the published articles and preprints of Covid-19

related literature from different scientific databases and sharing platforms.
Methods

: The PubMed, Elsevier, and Research Gate (RG) databases were under consideration in this

study over a specific time. Analyses were carried out on the number of publications as (a) function of
time (day), (b) journals and (c) authors. Doubling time of the number of publications was analyzed for
PubMed “all articles” and Elsevier published articles. Analyzed databases were (1A) PubMed “all
articles” (01/12/2019-12/06/2020) (1B) PubMed Review articles (01/12/2019-2/5/2020) and (1C)
PubMed Clinical Trials (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) (2) Elsevier all publications (01/12/2019- 25/05/2020)
(3) RG (Article, Pre Print, Technical Report) (15/04/2020 – 30/4/2020).
Findings

: Total publications in the observation period for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG were 23000, 5898

and 5393 respectively. The average number of publications/day for PubMed, Elsevier and RG were 70.0
±128.6, 77.6±125.3 and 255.6±205.8 respectively. PubMed shows an avalanche in the number of
publication around May 10, number of publications jumped from 6.0±8.4/day to 282.5±110.3/day. The
average doubling time for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 10.3±4 days, 20.6 days, and 2.3±2.0 days
respectively. In PubMed average articles/journal was 5.2±10.3 and top 20 authors representing 935
articles are of Chinese descent. The average number of publications per author for PubMed, Elsevier,
and RG was 1.2±1.4, 1.3±0.9, and 1.1±0.4 respectively. Subgroup analysis, PubMed review articles mean
and median review time for each article were <0|17±17|77> and 13.9 days respectively; and reducing at
a rate of -0.21 days (count)/day.
Interpretation

: Although the disease has been known for around 6 months, the number of publications

related to the Covid-19 until now is huge and growing very fast with time. It is essential to rationalize the
publications scientifically by the researchers, authors, reviewers, and publishing houses.

On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. This virus rapidly crossed
borders and led to a major healthcare crisis and economic slowdown.
Most international health organizations have stated an urgent need to stop, control and reduce the
impact of the virus at every opportunity (1).
Healthcare systems, various sectors of industry, and overall economy of the globe have been hit
severely by this pandemic. As of July 23, 2020, there were 15 million confirmed cases worldwide with
the number of fatalities in excess of 600, 000 so far. [1]
How has the scientific world reacted to this pandemic? This pandemic has brought to fore the gaping
incoherence in opinions expressed by agencies the world over. Government bodies, non-government
institutions, pharmaceutical industry, researchers have all made their sounds,

but without much

unison.
A sudden outbreak in the number of publications has been observed in the last few months. By one
estimate, the COVID-19 literature published since January has reached more than 23,000 papers and is
doubling every 20 days—among the biggest explosions of scientific literature ever. [2]

Another study says the covid-19 literature doubling time is 14 days. A quick run of the total count
of publications with the keyword "COVID-19", on Google Scholar shows about 20,500 results for 20192020. For the same period PubMed shows 23480 for the keyword "COVID-19" [All Fields] [as on 12-062020]. In addition to the staggering numbers, the pandemic has also affected the quality and content of
publications. Editors across the world have gone to the extent of appointing “COVID Editors”, who
supposedly are to take care of the section of the journals that deals with COVID articles. Professional
bodies, both national and international, of every specialty have attempted to bring out their own
“guidelines” and “recommendations” to deal with patients of their specialty in the “COVID situation”.
Researches seem to write articles endlessly, often repeating and restating what is already written.
This also raises questions on the quality of data and the authenticity of the results.
On April 29, 2020, after a hurriedly conducted trial, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases proposed Remdesivir, as an effective drug for this virus. [3] A contrary opinion was given in an
earlier article published in a reputed journal. This trial showed no benefit of using Remdesivir. [4] The
use of chloroquine is another example that stands out as an example, with divergent opinions from all
quarters. [5]
The need of the hour is to print and publish only credible, proven information on respective platforms,
including online and printed journals. The flooding of irrelevant junk needs to be stopped. COVID

pandemic came and hopefully should be over soon, but this irrelevant information junk shall remain
stored online for all times to come.
This study aims to evaluate the characteristics of the authors and topics from different databases and
publishing houses. In a subgroup analysis, nationalities of the corresponding authors were analyzed.

Materials and methods

: Different medical databases, publication houses and sharing platforms were

analyzed, each over a certain period of time to obtain the different characteristics and dynamics of the
published/uploaded articles. All the databases created a separate section to tackle the Covid-19 related
literature. The keywords in PubMed were “COVID-19” OR “Coronavirus” OR "Corona virus" OR
“Coronaviruses”. [6] Elsevier and Research Gate (RG) were having a separate database for Covid-19
specific research. [7-8]
The data for different databases were extracted as a spreadsheet (PubMed) or saved first as a html
(Elsevier and RG) file which was then converted into a spreadsheet. Several articles and write-ups with
only meager relationship to the disease were not further counted in the analysis.
Analyzed databases were (1a) PubMed “all articles” (12/06/2020 - 01/12/2019), (1b) PubMed review
articles (02/05/2020- 01/12/19), with a subgroup analysis of total review time, (1c) PubMed clinical
trials (January-June 2020); (2) Elsevier all publications except Erratum (December 2019- 25-05-2020) (3)
Research Gate (Published article, Pre-print, Technical Report) (15/04/2020 - 30/04/2020).
The dynamics of covid-19 related documents in PubMed, Elsevier, Research Gate databases were
analyzed for number of publications as (a) function of time (day), (b) journals and (c) authors. Number of
publications as a function of doubling time was analyzed for PubMed “all articles” and Elsevier published
articles.
Analysis of total review time (submission date to acceptance date) was done for 150 review articles
published in Elsevier and Covid -19 related control trials presented in PubMed.
Average values quoted in this article as <Minimum Value |Average ± Standard Deviation| Maximum

Total number of publications in PubMed: “all articles” was 23480. Analysis was limited to the last 10000
articles. Figure-1a shows the number of publications until 13/06/2020 as a function of date and a 5-days
moving average. The overall average (± Standard Deviation) number of publications is 70.0 ±128.6 /day.
The avalanche on number of publications that occurred after May 10, 2020 is seen from a look at the
number of average daily publications that jumped significantly from 6.0±8.4 to 282.5±110.3 (figure-1b).
As per the characteristics of the cumulative number, the publications were divided into two groups:
from 20/02/2020 to 10/05/2020 (Group-1) and from 11/05/2020 to 13/06/2020 (Group-2). In Group-1,
the cumulative number of publications (figure-2a) displayed a parabolic relationship against the days
with a major coefficient a=0.09. In the post-avalanche Group-2, it changed to a linear relationship with a
slope of m= 280.2 pointing to the average number of publications per day (282.5) during that period.
Post-avalanche increase in the number of publications per day was 4670%.

PubMed: “all articles” : Number of publications vs. journals

The analysis was limited to 10000 articles published in 1868 different journals. Number of articles per
journal was <1|15.2±10.3|191> (Median 2). While 750 journals published a single article, 695 journals
published 2 to 5 articles (2336 articles in total) and the rest 423 journals published 6914 articles. The
highest number of articles (191) was published by British Medical Journal (BMJ), followed by Journal of
Medical Virology (138) and Dermatologic Therapy (113). Figures 3a and 3b show the number of
publications as a function of the journal for range 1-9 and greater than or equal to 10 respectively.
Appendix-1 shows the list of journals and their published articles.

Figure-4 below presents the authors histogram. The average number of publications per author and the
range was <1|1.2±1.4|71>. Median number of publications was 1. A total of 41083 authors were
identified with 1 publication each, 3847 authors with 2 publications, 1583 with 3-10 publications, and
121 authors with 11-71 publications. A total of 8 authors have more than 50 publications. Top 20
authors representing 935 articles are of Chinese descent. Figure-4 presents the number of publications

Analysis of number of days taken for acceptance after submission

(PubMed review article: Subgroup Analysis)
A total of 150 review articles that appeared in PubMed between 06/11/2019 to 28/04/2020 were
analyzed for the number of days taken for acceptance (difference in days between acceptance and
submission dates) (Fig-6). Three articles were accepted on the same date of submission, 18 in 1 day, 9 in
2 days, 5 in 3-5 days, 22 in 6-10 days, 41 in 11-20 days, 33 in 21-30 days. Only 19 articles were in review
for more than 1 month. The average and median number of days in review were <1|17±17|77> days
and 13.9 days respectively. If fitted with a straight line (y = -0.2144x + 9433, not shown) with the
number of article review days reducing at a slope of -0.21 days (count)/day.

1C. Analysis of PubMed Clinical Trials

Between January-June 2020, PubMed showed a total of 17 randomized clinical trials (RCT) in (16 in
English and 1 in Chinese language) published in 16 journals, with Lancet alone publishing 2 trials.
However, after carefully reading each article, it was found that the publications from France and Italy
were not RCTs and the total was reduced to 15: 13 articles from China and 2 from Brazil. A total of 300
independent authors were involved in these articles, the median number of authors per article is 13 and
the range is from 6 to 65. Of these, only 6 articles have information on submission and accepted dates.
The average and median review time was <0|10.7±15.3|41> days, 5.5 days respectively. Two review
articles were from the same research group, Hainan General Hospital, Haikou, China which were
accepted in 0 and 2 days respectively in a single journal (Complementary therapies in clinical
practice). [9-10]

Elsevier identifies a total of 27845 authors, with 22675 authors with

lone articles, 3849 authors with 2 articles, 1297 authors with 3-10 articles and 23 authors with 10+
articles. The maximum number of articles for single authors was 34. Mean and range of the article is
<1|12.3±0.9|34>, median =1 article. Figure 9 shows the number of publications as a function of the
author (Elsevier).

3. Research Gate (RG) :

Between 15/04/2020 and 30/04/2020 total 5395 documents related to COVID-19 was uploaded to RG.
After carefully scrutinizing all entries, eliminating repetitions, erratum, presentations and comments,
the number of useful documents reduced to 4180. A total of 1986 documents have full text.

Publication vs days

Figure- 10 shows number of publications for each day during the last half of April 2020. Number of
publication as a function of days shows a parabolic relationship. The average and median number
publications were <40|258.4±130.8|441>/day and 273/day respectively.
The documents related to basic science, diagnosis, drug and vaccine development, social and economic
impact, public health, and treatment (with multiple option) were 635, 1622, 743, 927, 2179, and 1318
items respectively.

Doubling time:

During the latter half of April, RG encountered 6 doublings in the number of uploaded

documents. The doubling time for the number of publications is <1|2.3±2.0|6> days.

Discussion:

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has stimulated the global scientific community to take
unprecedented interest on a single subject aimed at learning more about the disease, sharing
knowledge immediately, and undertaking concerted, evidence-based efforts to manage the situation.
Calls for ensuring that all research findings relevant to COVID-19 be made available openly and promptly
had begun to be issued as early as in January. In March, UNESCO mobilized countries to promote open
science and data sharing to manage this crisis. Simultaneously, a global research roadmap for COVID-19
was issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) which pointed to the existing knowledge gaps. It
has also drawn up timelines for the implementation of specific research actions.
A large number of journals have made the Covid-19 literature free to access. With the rapid increase in
the number of publications, some of the journals have already crossed their December 2021 issue, and
many journals have filled until the December 2021 issue (as on 12-06-2020).
In our study, we found the growth of articles as a function of time in different databases to be
exponential, parabolic with low “a” value and linear with a very high gradient, pointing to a sudden,
steep growth in number of articles. The doubling times in different databases were also varying fast and
reducing continuously.
The situation calls for addressing some pertinent questions: (1) How is it possible to bring out such a
large volume of literature in such a short time? (2) What is the reliability of the data collection, analysis,
and literature review? (3) When articles, including randomized trials, are being accepted in a very short
time, some showing same day acceptance, what is the quality and reliability of the review? (4) How will
it be possible to read and comprehend this large volume of literature to extract useful information? (5)
Whether this plethora of literature is actually translating or will it ever translate into any medical, social,
or economical benefit? (6) How much of the information is real progress and how much is mere
repetition?
Probably the answer for most of the above questions shall be in negative. It is interesting to note that 8
authors have more than 50 publications each in the analyzed time. The growth pattern of the number of
literature is also alarming: doubling every 10.3 days in PubMed with a daily increase of 282.5±110.3
articles. Another matter of concern is the large presence of pseudoscientific facts, that are potentially
8

harmful, in these publications. [12] This tendency of somehow to get an article published, is seen across
the board, from established researchers of most reputed medical schools to undergraduate scholars
from little known universities. It is therefore not surprising that reputed journals had to do one of the
biggest ever retraction of scientific papers in the modern history, [13]

marking a grim testimony to

the chinks in the peer review process and robustness of audits. Even more concerning is that the
authors of these articles are well established researchers. [14-15]
These retracted papers are most often fabricated and serve as examples of how the Covid-19 has
overwhelmed the peer review process with a huge rush for publications. [16] Making use of the
prevailing situation, some new predator journals have also popped up, usually paid journals, to present
these pseudoscientific facts. [17]
Nevertheless, retraction of a paper does not necessarily cease completely its use or citation. Several
examples can be found in which retracted papers are cited several months after retraction. [18]
Our analysis also shows that authors from Peoples Republic of China (PRC) are the leading contributors
in the Covid-19 literature. First 20 leading authors in PubMed contributing an average of approximately
50 articles each, are of Chinese origin. A total of 87% of the controlled trials in PubMed has originated
from PRC; 90% investigators in controlled trials are of Chinese descent.
The other alarming tendency among the journals and reviewers are very short review time, which is
decreasing at a rate of -0.21 days with every passing day. Articles are often accepted in the same day or
within a week. In PubMed RCT section we found two randomized controlled trials which were accepted
in 1 day.
Another interesting feature in our analysis is the tendency of attaching the articles with “Covid-19”. [19]
This is perhaps being done to increase the chance of publication, but is potentially a concerning
tendency.
We have presented the data from a closed data sharing platform PubMed operated by National Institute
of Health with no role of end users, data from one publishing house (Elsevier) and an open data sharing
platform Research Gate operated by the end users. This helps in truly reflecting the overall scenario of
all kinds of closed and open scientific data sharing platforms on Covid-19 data dynamics.
Has the interest in publishing more on Covid-19 has taken undue precedence over other subjects? The
answer to this pertinent question can be judged from the fact that the number of publications on Covid19 stands at 15354 that far exceeds the number of publications on cancer (in its all derivatives) which is
a paltry 4718 (as on 14/07/2020).

Conclusion

Our analysis of the dynamics of publications as a function of days, journals, authors in three different
types of databases has undoubtedly proved the skewed bias toward excessive, unwarranted publishing
on Covid-19 pandemic. Though the disease has been declared as a global pandemic, it does not warrant
unwanted literature piling up continuously. Research groups, publishing houses, journals, reviewers and
all associates need to realize that the race for publications related to Covid-19 needs to be pragmatic,
not a blind one. Publishing articles based on scientifically unimportant, pseudoscientific, fabricated,
unreliable and harmful facts just to increase the number of publications and citations is actually harmful
to society and disservice to the scientific community.
