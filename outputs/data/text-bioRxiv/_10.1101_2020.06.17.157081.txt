ABSTRACT
A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has
emerged as a human pathogen, causing global pandemic and resulting in over
400,000 deaths worldwide. The surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates the
process of coronavirus entry into human cells by binding angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2). Due to the critical role in viral-host interaction and the exposure
of spike protein, it has been a focus of most vaccines‚Äô developments. However,
the structural and biochemical studies of the spike protein are challenging because
it is thermodynamically metastable1. Here, we develop a new pipeline that
automatically identifies mutants that thermodynamically stabilize the spike protein.
Our pipeline integrates bioinformatics analysis of conserved residues, motion
dynamics from molecular dynamics simulations, and other structural analysis to
identify residues that significantly contribute to the thermodynamic stability of the
spike protein. We then utilize our previously developed protein design tool, Eris,
to predict thermodynamically stabilizing mutations in proteins. We validate the

ability of our pipeline to identify protein stabilization mutants through known
prefusion spike protein mutants. We finally utilize the pipeline to identify new
prefusion spike protein stabilization mutants.

INTRODUCTION
The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus2‚Äì4, which causes fever, severe
respiratory illness, and pneumonia, poses a major public health and governance
challenges. The emerging pathogen has been characterized as a new member of
the betacoronavirus genus (SARS-CoV-2)5,6, closely related to several bat
coronaviruses and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV)7,8. Compared with SARS-COV, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more readily
transmitted from human to human, spreading to multiple continents and leading to
the World Health Organization (WHO)‚Äôs declaration of a pandemic on March 11,
20209. According to the WHO, as of June 9, 2020, there had been >7,000,000
confirmed cases globally, leading to >400,000 deaths.
In the initial step of the infection, the coronavirus enters the host cell by binding to
a cellular receptor and fusing the viral membrane with the target cell
membrane10,11. For SARS-CoV-2, this process is mediated by spike glycoprotein
which is a homo-trimer12. In the process of viruses fusing to host cells, the spike
protein undergoes structural rearrangement and transits from a metastable
prefusion conformational state to a highly stable post-fusion conformational
state13,14. The spike protein comprises of two functional units, S1 and S2 subunits;
when fused to the host cell, the two subunits are cleaved. The S1 subunit is
responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)15‚Äì17
receptor on the host cell membrane and it contains the N-terminal domain (NTD),
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). NTD in the
S1 subunit assists recognize sugar receptors. RBD in the S1 subunit is critical for
the binding of coronavirus to the ACE-2 receptor18‚Äì21. CTD in the S1 subunit could

recognize other receptors22. The binding of RBD to ACE2 facilitates the cleavage
of the spike protein and promotes the dissociation of the S1 subunit from the S2
subunit23. S2 contains two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2), a fusion peptide, and
a protease cleavage site (S2‚Äô). The dissociation of S1 induces S2 to undergo a
dramatic structural change to fuse the host and viral membranes. Thus, the spike
protein serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and
vaccines24. Coronavirus transits from a metastable prefusion state to a highly
stable post-fusion state as part of the spike protein‚Äôs role in membrane fusion. The
instability of the prefusion state presents a significant challenge for the production
of protein antigens for antigenic presentation of the prefusion antibody epitopes
that are most likely to lead to neutralizing responses. Thus, since the prefusion
spike protein exists in a thermodynamically metastable state1, a stabilized mutant
conformation is critical for the development of vaccines and drugs.
Computational mutagenesis is an effective approach to finding mutations that are
able to stabilize proteins. We have previously developed a protein design platform,
Eris25,26, which utilizes a physical force field27 for modeling inter-atomic
interactions, as well as fast side-chain packing and backbone relaxation algorithms
to enable efficient and transferrable protein molecular design. Originally, Eris has
been validated on 595 mutants from five proteins, corroborating the unbiased force
field, side-chain packing and backbone relaxation algorithms. In many later
studies, Eris has been validated through prediction of thermodynamically
stabilizing or destabilizing mutations28‚Äì33, and direct protein design efforts34‚Äì37.
In this work, we propose a pipeline to automatically stabilize spike proteins through
computational mutagenesis. Within the pipeline, we first analyze the conservation
score and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of residues in the protein. We
then perform discrete molecular dynamics (DMD)38‚Äì41 simulations to calculate the
root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of residues to analyze their flexibility. Based
on this information, we select appropriate residues (2 < Conservation Score < 5;
SASA > 0.4; RMSF > 3.5 √Ö; see Discussion) as mutation sites. We subject the
selected residues to computational redesign using Eris to find the stabilizing

mutations by calculating the change in free energy ‚àÜ‚àÜùê∫ = ‚àÜùê∫ùëöùë¢ùë° ‚àí ‚àÜùê∫ùëäùëá , where
‚àÜùê∫ùëöùë¢ùë° and ‚àÜùê∫ùëäùëá are the free energies of the mutant protein and wild type proteins
correspondingly. We utilize this pipeline to identify stabilization mutants of the
spike protein. Next, we describe our methods in detail and provide a list of
stabilizing mutations for spike protein.
METHODS
Remodeling of the spike protein in different states. We utilize the crystal
structure of the prefusion conformation12 of the spike protein (6VSB) as the
template to model the spike protein through homology modeling by using
MODELLER42. We generate 5 models and select the model with the lowest
Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE)43, which is a statistical potential used
to assess homology models in protein structure prediction, as the representative
conformation of the spike protein. Since steric clashes are common in modeled
and low-resolution structures, we employ Chiron44 to optimize the structure of the
spike protein. Chiron resolves atomic clashes by performing short-DMD38‚Äì41,45,46
simulations on protein structures with minimal or no perturbation to the backbone.
Both the template structure and the modeled structure have one RBD in up
conformation and two RBDs in down conformation (1-up-2-down). We utilize
PyMol47 to create a trimeric spike protein structure with all three RBDs in up
conformation (3up) and another trimeric structure with all three RBDs in down
conformation (3-down), respectively. Based on the modeled structure with all
missing atoms and residues completed, we first duplicate the monomer structure
with the RBD in down conformation (down-monomer) and then align it to the
monomer structure with the RBD in the up conformation (up-monomer). Then, we
delete the up-monomer to get the 3-down trimeric structure. Similarly, we duplicate
two up-monomers in the modeled 1-up-2-down structure and then align them to
the two down-monomers, respectively. Finally, we delete the two original downmonomers to get a 3-up trimeric structure of the spike protein.

Multiple sequence alignment and Conservation score. We use ConSurf48 to
investigate the conservation score of the spike protein. The ConSurf server is a
bioinformatics tool for estimating the evolutionary conservation of amino/nucleic
acid positions in a protein/DNA/RNA molecule based on the phylogenetic relations
between homologous sequences.
Molecular Dynamics Simulation. We use DMD38‚Äì41, an event-driven simulation
which employs a discrete potential energy that relies on the calculation of atomic
collisions. In DMD, the all-atom protein model interacts through the implicit solvent
force-field, Medusa, which includes the van der Waals interaction, hydrogen
bonds, electrostatic, dihedral and angular interactions, and those due to the
effective solvent. We perform 1,000,000 step DMD simulation for the cryo-EM
structure of the prefusion spike protein, with the temperature set as 0.4 using the
ANDERSON thermostat. The heat exchange rate is 0.1. A cubic box (500 √Ö x 500
√Ö x 500 √Ö) with periodic boundary condition has been employed. For the analysis,
we only consider equilibrated trajectories, discarding the first part of the trajectories
that are not equilibrated due to the initial high energy. The analyses of RMSF and
RMSD are performed using MDAnalysis49.
Computational Mutagenesis. The spike protein structure is subject to in silico
mutagenesis studies using Eris molecular suite. Eris‚Äôs protocol induces mutation
in proteins and estimates free energies of mutant (ŒîGmut) and wild type (ŒîGwt)
conformations. Eris25 performs rapid side-chain repacking and backbone
relaxation around the mutation site using the Monte-Carlo algorithm and
subsequently evaluates ŒîGwt and ŒîGmut using Medusa force field. Then, Eris‚Äôs
algorithm computes the change in free energy of the protein upon mutation by
employing the following formula: ŒîŒîGmut = ŒîGmut ‚àí ŒîGwt. Finally, Eris evaluates
ŒîŒîGmut values to estimate the stabilizing (ŒîŒîGmut < 0) or destabilizing (ŒîŒîGmut > 0)
effect of the mutations.
RESULTS
Protein stabilization pipeline

We propose a pipeline to automatically find stabilized mutants of proteins (Figure
1). The pipeline can be divided into two stages. In the first stage, users designate
the protein of interest, and then the pipeline will analyze the 3D structure of the
protein by using different metrics. In the second stage, users designate the
mutation sites according to the analysis of the 3D structure of the protein, and
finally the pipeline will determine the stabilizing mutations of the protein. Users can
either upload the 3D structure of the protein or input the PDB ID of the protein to
designate the protein of interest. In the first stage, the first step is to remodel the
3D structure of the protein of interest to complete the missing atoms and residues.
We integrate MODELLER into our pipeline to remodel proteins. Next, the pipeline
utilizes ConSurf48 to calculate the conservation score of each residue in the protein
of interest. The conservation score indicates the importance of the residue in
maintaining protein structure and/or function. Subsequently, the pipeline utilizes
DMD to analyze the flexibility of each residue in the spike protein through RMSF.
The technique has already been used to efficiently study the protein folding
thermodynamics and protein oligomerization and allows for a good equilibration of
the structures. Then, the pipeline will calculate SASA of residues in the protein.
In the second stage, users designate the mutation sites according to the
conservation score, RMSF, and SASA. A high conservation score (‚â• 7) indicates
the residue may play important roles in the function or the stability of the structure
of the protein; residues of high RMSF (> 3.5 √Ö) are likely the culprit to undermine
the stability of the structure of the protein, hence we select residues that have a
low conservation score or high RMSF; residues with SASA < 0.5 are considered
buried and residues with SASA ‚â• 0.5 are considered exposed to solvent. After the
designation of the mutation sites, the pipeline utilizes Eris to determine the
changes in free energies of the mutants. For each residue in the mutation sites,
Eris will mutate the amino acid type of the residue to the other 19 amino acid types,
iteratively. For each mutant, Eris will calculate the ŒîŒîG, which is the difference of
the free energy of the mutant relative to the wild type. Positive ŒîŒîG means the
mutant decreases the stability of the protein, and negative ŒîŒîG means the mutant

can stabilize the protein. The mutants that have the lowest ŒîŒîG will be selected
as the stabilization mutants.
Remodeling of the spike protein structure
We utilize MODELLER42 to re-model the 3D structure of the spike protein by using
a structure deposited to Protein DataBank (PDB), PDBID:6VSB 12, the cryo-EM
structure of the prefusion state of the spike protein, as the template structure to
complete the missing atoms and residues (Figure 2A&B). Next, we use Chiron44,
a protein energy minimization tool based on DMD, to optimize the modeled
structure of the spike protein. We evaluate the modeled structure by calculating
the DOPE score of each residue. DOPE of residues in the region (1147-1288) near
the C-terminal are higher than that of other regions because this region is not
experimentally solved in the template structure 6VSB (Figure 2C). The deposited
structure 6VSB is a spike protein trimer, where one RBD is in up conformation and
the other two RBDs are in down conformation. RBD domain can only bind to the
ACE2 receptor when it is in the up conformation. Based on the modeled structure,
we next model two spike protein structures that have all 3 RBDs in up conformation
(Figure 2D) and have all 3 RBDs in down conformation (Figure 2E), respectively.
All following computational mutagenesis study are performed using the structure
with the 3 RBDs in down conformation.
Validation of the protein stabilization capability of the pipeline through
known mutants
To validate the ability of the pipeline to identify stabilization mutants, we use the
pipeline to calculate the free energy changes of several known prefusion spike
protein stabilization mutants. The 2P mutation strategy (K986P and V987P) has
been proved effective for the stabilization of spike protein of SARS-COV-2 and
other betacoronavirus12,20,50. Hsieh and coworkers51 have tested a large amount
of mutants and found the best mutant, HexaPro, which has six beneficial prolines
substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P, and V987P) leading to ~10fold higher expression. We calculate the free energy change of the 2P mutant and

the HexaPro mutant through Eris. The free energy change of the 2P mutant is 6.024 kcal/mol, indicative of the more stable property of the mutant than the wild
type structure. The free energy change of the HexaPro mutant is -16.143 kcal/mol,
suggesting that it is even more stable than the 2P mutant. Thus, these
computational calculation of the stabilities of the 2P mutant and the HexaPro
mutant are in agreement with the experimental demonstration of their stability.
Identification of new mutation sites in the spike protein
The spike protein is mainly composed of S1 and S2 subunits (Figure S1). We
select residues for mutation from the NTD and RBD domains in S1, and we also
select residues from the HR1 (heptad repeat 1) and CH (central helix) domains in
S2. We don‚Äôt select residues from HR2 domain in S2 because the structure of the
HR2 domain has not been solved in the cryo-EM structure 6VSB. At the outset, we
calculate the conservation score (Figure 3A&D) of all residues by using ConSurf.
Based on the conservation score, most residues in HR1/CH are conservative,
while residues in NTD and RBD are prone to mutation in evolution. Next, we use
Pymol47 to calculate SASA of all residues in the spike protein (Figure 3B&E). SASA
indicates the level of residues exposed to the solvent in a protein and usually most
of the functional residues are located on the protein structure‚Äôs surface52. All four
domains have both low SASA residues and high SASA residues. Then, we perform
1,000,000 steps DMD simulation for the spike protein to calculate the RMSF of
each residue (Figure 3C&F). The residues in HR1/CH have extremely low RMSF,
while the residues in NTD and RBD domains have moderate to high RMSF.
We select residues that have different conservation scores in these four domains
for mutagenesis. In the NTD, we select 5 residues (Table S1) with the conservation
score ranging from 1 (highly variable) to 9 (highly conservative). The SASA of
these residues range from 0.01 (buried) to 0.75 (exposed). The RMSF range from
1.61 √Ö (frozen) to 4.88 √Ö (flexible). Likewise, in the other three domains (Table S23), we select 5 to 7 residues, respectively. These residues also have diverse
conservation scores, SASA, and RMSF. Of note, to avoid affecting the function of

the spike protein, these residues are all not chosen from the functional sites of the
spike protein, such as the ACE2 binding site in RBD.
Stabilization mutants of the spike protein
We utilize Eris to calculate the free energy changes of mutants relative to the wild
type (Figure 4A, Figure S2&3, and Table S4-6). In the NTD, 5 residues, E169,
K113, I203, R246, and L270 are selected for mutagenesis. Among them, the free
energy changes of nearly all mutations of residues I203, R246, and L270 are
positive, indicating that they are destabilizing the structure. In contrast, most
mutations on residues E169 and K113 have negative free energy changes,
suggesting that they are stabilizing the structure. The mutant that has the most
negative free energy change is R246C. However, cysteine is prone to forming
disulfide bond with other cysteine, which may affect the correct folding of the
protein structure, so we recommend K113M to be a better choice as the
stabilization mutant.
In the RBD, 5 residues (A411, T415, Y505, N439, and D428) (Table S2) are
selected for mutagenesis. The free energy changes calculated by Eris (Figure S2,
Table S5) show that most residues have stabilization mutants, which have
negative free energy changes, except for Y505. The most stable mutants are
T415V and D428M.
In the HR1/CH domain, 7 residues (L948, I1018, A1026, Y1007, S1003, T961, and
V976) are selected for mutagenesis as shown in Table S3. In stark contrast to NTD
and RBD, most residues have extremely high free energy changes (> 30 kcal/mol),
suggesting that these residues are not very good choices for mutagenesis. The
high free energy changes also implicate that they may play important roles in
stabilizing the structure so that they are irreplaceable to some extent. This finding
is also in concert with the high conservation scores of these residues. That said,
we can still find stabilization mutants for these residues, such as T961A and
S1003M (Figure S3).

DISCUSSION
Compared to experimental mutagenesis, such as random mutagenesis 53,54 and
site-directed mutagenesis55,56, computational mutagenesis25 is an efficient
alternative that lays the foundation of large-scale mutation screening. However,
performing computational mutation screening for all residues in the spike protein
trimeric structure, which consists of 1288 residues in each monomer, is still timeconsuming and inefficient, so we seek to select critical residues to perform
mutagenesis. In this work, to interrogate how to select residues as mutation sites,
we select residues that have different conservation scores, SASA, and RMSF. We
find that the probability of stabilizing mutations for specific residues is correlated
with the conservation score, SASA, and RMSF of these residues (Figure 4B-D).
We calculate the average and the minimum free energy change of all 19 mutations
of each residue. We find that the average free energy change of mutations of
residues with either high (>5) or low (<2) conservation score are typically larger
than 0. Only mutations in residues that have moderate (2~5) conservation score
have negative average free energy change, thus indicating a possibility to find
stabilizing mutations. We posit that conservative residues are typically playing
critical roles in structural stability or protein functioning57, making them a likely
target for finding stabilizing mutations. However, if the conservation score of the
residue is too high, the residue may be irreplaceable and any mutation will
destabilize the structure. On the other hand, residues with low conservation scores
may be less critical to the structural stability, reducing the chances for finding
stabilizing mutations at these positions. Thus, we select residues that have
moderate conservation score (2~5) for mutagenesis. Similarly, we find that
residues with large SASA or large RMSF have more stabilization mutants than
residues with low SASA or low RMSF, respectively. Overall, we select residues
that have moderate conservation score (2~5), high SASA (>0.4), and high RMSF
(>3.5 √Ö) for mutagenesis. In addition, although we only select residues in NTD,
RBD, and HR1/CH domains to perform mutagenesis, residues in other regions can
also be used as mutation sites. For example, the known 2P mutation strategy

(K986P and V987P) has been proved effective for the stabilization of spike protein
of SARS-COV-2 and other betacoronavirus12,20,50.
In this work, we propose a pipeline to automatically stabilize proteins through
computational mutagenesis. We analyze the conservation score, RMSF, and
SASA of residues in the spike protein through the pipeline. We propose criteria
based on the conservation score, RMSF, and SASA to identify residues for
mutation. Finally, we utilize Eris to calculate the free energy change and find
stabilizing mutants.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1. The pipeline of the stabilization of spike protein. The pipeline is
roughly divided into two stages. In the first stage, users designate the protein of
interest through either the 3D structure of the PDB ID. The pipeline will then
analyze the conversation score, SASA, and RMSF of each residue in the protein.
In the second stage, users designate the mutation sites for stabilization
mutagenesis. Resides that have moderate conversation score, low SASA, and
high RMSF are selected as the mutation sites. The pipeline then utilizes Eris to
identify the stabilizing mutantions. Finally, the stabilization capability of these
mutants is validated by DMD simulations.
Figure 2. Remodeling results of the spike protein structure. (A) Comparison
of the crystal structure and the remodeled structure of the spike protein. (B) The
surface representation of the spike protein. The extra blue loops are the completed
loops. (C) The DOPE score of each residue in the structure remodeled by
MODELLER. (D) The remodeled structure of the spike protein with three RBD in
up conformations. (E) The remodeled structure of the spike protein with three
RBDs in down conformations.
Figure 3. Conservation score, SASA, and RMSF of the spike protein. (A) The
conservation score of residues in the spike protein. Conservation score of 9 means
highly conserved, while conservation score of 1 means a highly variable position.
(B) SASA of residues in the spike protein. (C) The RMSF of residues in the spike
protein. (D) The 3D structures of the spike protein colored by the conservation
score. The red/blue colors indicate highly conserved/highly variable residues. (E)
The 3D structure of the spike protein colored SASA. The red/blue colors indicate
exposed/buried residues. (F) The 3D structure of the spike protein colored by
RMSF. Red means flexible and blue means frozen.

(ŒîŒîG) of all mutations on the selected residues in NTD of the spike protein. (B)
The correlation between free energy change and the conservation score for all
mutants of the four domains. The blue dots refer to the average free energy change
of all 19 mutants of each residue. The bottom end of each grey line refers to the
minimum free energy change of all 19 mutants of the residue. (C) The correlation
between free energy change and SASA for all mutants of residues in the four
domains. (D) The correlation between free energy change and RMSF for all
mutants of residues in the four domains.
