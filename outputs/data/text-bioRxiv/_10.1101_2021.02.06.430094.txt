The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells using a mechanism
that involves binding and structural rearrangement of its spike protein. Understanding protein rearrangement and identifying specific residues where mutations affect protein rearrangement has attracted a lot of attention for drug
development. We use a mathematical method introduced in [9] to associate a
local topological/geometrical free energy along the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
backbone. Our results show that the total local topological free energy of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monotonically decreases from pre-to post-fusion and
that its distribution along the protein domains is related to their activity in
protein rearrangement. By using density functional theory (DFT) calculations
with inclusion of solvent effects, we show that high local topological free energy
conformations are unstable compared to those of low topological free energy.

By comparing to experimental data, we find that the high local topological free
energy conformations in the spike protein are associated with mutations which
have the largest experimentally observed effect to protein rearrangement.

1 Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the COVID-19
global pandemic which has taken over 2 million lives. The need to stop the spread of the
highly infectious virus requires disruption in the infection process and has become the focus
for many scientists. Even more so, the task to be able to control and stop a global pandemic
in the future is of great interest. Fusion of the membranes of both a host cell and a viral
cell is necessary for infection [10]. Viral glycoproteins aid in this process by facilitating
the binding of the two cells. Viral glycoproteins are folded proteins on the enveloped
viral cell membrane which, when triggered, undergo irreversible dramatic conformational
changes [14, 19, 24, 42, 48, 62, 63]. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a class I viral glyco-protein
that consists in two subdomains (S1 and S2) and is triggered by cleavage at the S1 cleavage
site [14, 14, 20, 25, 30, 37, 63]. S1, containing a receptor binding domain (RBD), binds to a host
cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and leads to a second cleavage at an
S2’ cleavage site, adjacent to the fusion peptide. The protein undergoes several structural
rearrangements that lead to a stable post-fusion state which brings the two membranes
together [14]. In this manuscript, we quantify these changes with the aim to understand how
local changes can trigger global conformations.
Folded proteins are defined by their primary, secondary, tertiary and quarternary structure
[1]. The primary structure refers to the protein by amino acid sequence. The secondary
structure refers to a sequence of 3-dimensional building blocks the protein attains (beta

sheets, α-helices, coils). The tertiary structure refers to the 3-dimensional conformation of the
entire polypeptide chain. The rearrangement of viral proteins during protein fusion changes
both their tertiary structure and their secondary structure. We use tools from knot theory,
namely, the Writhe and the Torsion, to characterize the viral protein conformations at the
length-scale of 4 consecutive residues along the backbone.
In the last decades, measures from knot theory have been applied to biopolymers [3–8,
12, 13, 16, 21, 29, 35, 38, 39, 46, 50, 51, 54, 56, 58] and in particular to proteins to classify their
conformations [6–8, 15, 23, 31, 41, 46, 53, 55]. One of the simplest measures of conformational
complexity of proteins that does not require an approximation of the protein by a knot dates
back to Gauss; the Writhe of a curve. In [9] the Writhe and the Torsion were used to define
a novel topological/geometrical free energy that can be assigned locally to the protein. The
results therein showed that high local topological free energy conformations are independent
of the local sequence and may be involved in the rate limiting step in protein folding.
In this paper we apply this method to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to characterize its
conformation in various phases of viral fusion. Our results show that the local topological
free energy of the spike protein is decreasing monotonically as the protein undergoes various
conformational changes pre-fusion to post-fusion, in agreement with a transition of the protein
from a metastable to stable state. Our results in combination with DFT calculations suggest
that local conformations of high local topological free energy are unstable. By comparing
our results to experimental data, we find that residues in high local topological free energy
conformations are possible candidates for mutations with impact on protein rearrangement.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the topological and geometrical
functions for characterizing 3-dimensional conformation used in this paper and the density
function theory calculations used to evaluate conformational stability. Section 3 describes
the results of this method for SARS-CoV-2. Finally, in Section 4, we summarize the findings

of our analysis.

2 Methods
In this Section we give some definitions necessary for the rest of the manuscript.

2.1 Measures of topological/geometrical complexity
We represent proteins by their CA atoms, as linear polygonal curves in space. A measure of
conformational complexity of curves in 3-space is the Gauss linking integral. When applied
to one curve, this integral is called the Writhe of a curve:
Definition 2.1. (Writhe). For an oriented curve ` with arc-length parameterization γ(t),
the Writhe, W r, is the double integral over l:

||γ(t) − γ(s)||3

(1)

It is a measure of the number of times a chain winds around itself and can have both
positive and negative values.
The total Torsion of the chain, describes how much it deviates from being planar and is
defined as:
Definition 2.2. The Torsion of an oriented curve ` with arc-length parameterization γ(t) is
the double integral over l:

The Writhe and the Torsion have successfully been applied to study entanglement in
biopolymers and proteins in particular [2, 6, 6–8, 17, 18, 40, 43–45, 47, 49, 52].

An important property of the Gauss linking integral and the Torsion which makes them
useful in practice is that they can be applied to polygonal curves of any length to characterize
3-dimensional conformations at different length scales. In this work, we use the Writhe and
the Torsion to characterize the local conformation of parts of the protein at the length scale
of 4 residues, we call this the local Writhe (local Torsion, resp.).
Definition 2.3. We define the local Writhe of a residue (resp. local Torsion), represented
by the CA atom i to be the Writhe (resp. Torsion) of the protein backbone connecting the
CA atoms i, i + 1, i + 2, i + 3.

The local Writhe is a measure of the local orientation of a polygonal curve and a measure
of its compactness. For example a very tight right handed turn (resp. left-handed) will have
a positive (resp. negative) Writhe value close to 1 (resp. −1), while a relatively straight
segment will have a value close to 0. Similarly, the Torsion is 0 for a planar segment and
increases to ±1 as the segment deviates from being planar.

2.2 Topological/Geometrical free energy
In this Section we give the definition of the local topological free energy, originally defined
in [9]. To assign a topological/geometrical free energy along a protein backbone, we first

derive the distributions of the local Writhe and local Torsion and local ACN in the ensemble
of folded proteins. To do this in practice, we use a curated subset of the crystal structures
provided in the PDB [11]. Namely, we use the dataset of unbiased, high-quality 3-dimensional
structures with less than 60% homology identity from [60]. Then for each residue of a given
protein we compare its local Writhe (resp. Torsion) value to those of the ensemble and a free
energy is assigned to the residue based on the population of that value in the ensemble.
Let X denote a topological parameter (local Writhe, local Torsion). Let dX denote the
density (ie. the number of occurrences) of X in the folded ensemble (dW r , dT , respectively).
Let mX (resp. mW r , mT ) denote the maximum occurrence value for X. To any value p of X,
we associate a purely topological/geometrical free energy:

Π(p) = ln[d(m)/d(p)]

(3)

The total local topological free energy of a protein is defined as the sum of local topological
free energies in Writhe (resp. Torsion) along the protein backbone. In [9] it was shown that
the experimentally observed folding rates of a set of 2-state single domain proteins decrease
with increasing total local topological free energy of the proteins.
We will say that a residue is rare or in high local topological free energy in a parameter
X (local Writhe or local Torsion) if its value X = p is such that Π(p) ≥ w, where w is a
threshold corresponding to the 95th percentile of Π-values across the set of folded proteins.
We stress that our definition of rare residue involves 4 consecutive residues, starting from
the one we label as rare. We will say that a residue is in a high local topological free energy
conformation, we denote LTE, when it is one of the 4 residues composing a conformation
with high local topological free energy. The 95th percentile of the ΠW r -value distribution
in the PDB culled set corresponds approximately to absolute Writhe values greater than
0.1. The 95th percentile of the ΠT -value distribution in the PDB corresponds approximately

to absolute Torsion values greater than 0.3 or smaller than 0.1. Thus, high LTE in Writhe
values correspond to high Writhe in absolute value, while high LTE in Torsion values may be
values close to 0 in absolute value. This suggests that high LTE conformations in Writhe may
not necessarily be high LTE in Torsion conformations and the opposite. In [9] it was found
that high local topological free energy conformations are independent of local sequence. By
comparison with experimental data it was shown that the number of such local conformations
in a protein may be related to the rate limiting step in protein folding [9].

2.3 Density Function Theory (DFT) Calculations
Geometry optimizations of the identified high local topological free energy within the SARSCoV-2 spike protein, were carried out in a model aqueous solution phase without imposing
geometrical restrictions by using the NWChem suite of programs (version 7.0.2) [59]. All
residues were optimized at the MO6-2X/6-311++G** level, e.g., via hybrid metafunctionals
[66], and solvent effects were accounted for by using the Solvation Model Based on Density
(SMD), [36]. The optimization of the identified residues via DFT was done to evaluate the
validity of our hypothesis that high local topological free energy conformations are indicative
of unstable structures.

that the total local topological free energy in Torsion decreases from pre-fusion to post-fusion
for all proteins. Similarly, we find that the total local topological free energy in Writhe also
decreases pre-fusion to post-fusion, with the exception of SARS. This suggests that viral
proteins during fusion are guided towards a minimum of the total local topological free energy,
in agreement with a transition from a metastable to a stable state.

(Left) and Torsion (Right) of viral glycoproteins pre- (in blue) and post-fusion (in black). Some
pre-fusion proteins are composed by two chains (one of which is the RBD) and are shown in two
separate blue columns.

3.1.2 Local topological free energy of SARS-CoV-2 from closed to open conformation
We found that the total topological free energy of SARS-CoV-2 decreases from pre- to
post-fusion (see Figure 2). We next analyze how the local topological free energy changes in
various pre-fusion stages. In pre-fusion the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein may be in uncleaved
closed, cleaved closed, cleaved open and intermediate state (see Figure 8 Top). A closed
conformation entails that all three RBD are in the down position [14]. An open conformation
entails that there is an RBD in the up position, accessible for the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 or ACE2 receptor to bind [14, 30, 64]. A cleaved protein indicates that the protein
has been proteolytically cleaved at the cleavage site by a furin protease into the receptor

binding subunit of S1. This is necessary for conformational changing of the RBD in human
coronavirus. The fusion subunit of S2 remains associated after cleavage until post-fusion [65].
An intermediate conformation indicates that cleavage at the RBD has occurred and the RBD
has been removed yet refolding has not occurred [14].

decrease of the local topological free energy from the closed uncleaved, closed cleaved, open
and intermediate conformation in Writhe. We also find a decrease from the closed uncleaved
to the intermediate conformation in Torsion (see SI).
Figure 8 (Bottom Right) shows the distribution of the total local topological free energy in
each domain of SARS-CoV-2 normalized by the length of the domain in closed uncleaved,
closed cleaved, open and intermediate conformations. Our results suggest that a decrease
of the local topological free energy in a domain is associated with a rearrangement of the
domain in 3-space and possibly with its involvement in protein rearrangement. Namely, we
see that the total local topological free energy of the RBD, which is involved in the initial
stage of pre-fusion rearrangement, decreases continuously. We see that the fusion peptide has
overall much higher total local topological free energy in Writhe in the closed conformations,
where it is protected, and decreases sharply in the open conformations, where it is exposed.
From closed to open HR1 and S2, which are involved in pre-fusion rearrangement, also show
a decrease. On the other hand, the CTD, which is involved in the protein rearrangement that
follows after opening and binding from pre-fusion to post-fusion, shows an increase in local
topological free energy. Similarly, we see an increase of the total local topological free energy
of CH from the open to intermediate state. CH may play a role post-fusion in extending the
protein.
3.1.3 Local topological free energy of SARS-CoV-2 in D614, G614 and HexaPro
mutations
In the previous sections we analyzed the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 D614 variant. This
variant contains the S-2P stabilizing mutation. This is one of the most studied variants in
the literature for which open/closed/intermediate crystal structures are reported. In this
Section we compare this variant to two other variants of interest, G614 and HexaPro [28].

Our results in Figure 4 (Right), show that the G614 variant has an overall much higher local
topological free energy in comparison to the HexaPro variant and the D614 variant. This is
in agreement with experimental results which suggest that the D614 and HexaPro are more
stable. The D614 variant is proposed to form a hydrogen bond with T859 (of the neighboring
protomer or chain), limiting its flexibility while the G614 variant does not form this bond [34].
The HexaPro variant consists in 6 mutations [28] and has shown to stabilize the pre-fusion
structure and produced high yield. In terms of the distribution of the local topological free
energy in domains, we find that the G614 variant has increased local topological free energy
in SD1, SD2, CD and HR1 domains. The results for ΠT are similar and are shown in SI.

3.2 High local topological free energy conformations
In this section we focus on those local conformations in SARS-CoV-2 with high local topological
free energy.
3.2.1 DFT minimized local conformations
In this section we use DFT calculations to compare the minimal energy configurations of
high local topological free energy versus medium/low topological free energy conformations
in SARS-CoV-2.

We calculate the difference (ΠW r )DF T − (ΠW r )P DB , between the ΠW r values of the DFT
obtained conformations versus those of the PDB. We do this for the high local topological
free energy conformations versus medium or low local topological free energy conformations
in SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of the differences is shown in Figure 5. Orange indicates
the difference for high local topological free energy conformations and blue for medium/low
local topological free energy conformations.

Figure 5: The distribution of (ΠW r )DF T − (ΠW r )P DB . The difference for residues in high local
topological free energy conformations is shown in orange and that of medium or local topological free
energy conformations is shown in blue. The distribution of high LTE minimized differences has a
skewness of −0.006 while that of medium/low LTE has skewness of 1.717. We note that 2 of the
largest positive differences in medium/low LTE (outliers in blue) are for conformations that proceed
a gap in the PDB sequence.

Our results show that the distribution of (ΠW r )DF T − (ΠW r )P DB is more broad for the
high LTE conformations compared to the medium/low LTE conformations. The skewness
of the distribution of the medium/low LTE conformations is 1.717, while that of the high
LTE conformations is −0.006. In particular, we find that for the majority of medium/low
topological free energy conformations, their DFT structure is either very similar or it has
lower local topological free energy. In contrast, many of the DFT reduced conformations

of the high local topological free energy conformations, have even higher local topological
free energy. These results further corroborate the idea that high local topological free energy
conformations are indicative of unstable structures.
3.2.2 High local topological free energy conformations in SARS-CoV-2
The high LTE conformations in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein at various stages pre-fusion,
post-fusion and for some of its variants are given in Table 1 in SI. The local conformations
are denoted by the first residue they are composed by. Thus the table lists only those initial
residues.
The distribution of high local topological conformations in Writhe in the SARS-CoV-2
D614 and G614 variants pre-fusion domains and D614 post-fusion is shown in Figure 6. We
find a higher number of high LTE in Writhe conformations in HR1 in the G614 variant than
in D614. HR2 has a high number of high LTE conformations only post-fusion.

Figure 6: The distribution of high LTE conformations in domains in SARS-CoV-2 D614 and G164
variants pre-fusion and D614 post-fusion.

The number of high local topological free energy conformations in Writhe in the D614
variant in closed uncleaved, closed cleaved, open and intermediate states pre-fusion are shown
in Figure 7. Overall, we see the same trends as those reported for the local topological
free energy per domain, suggesting that the presence of high local topological free energy

conformations.

stages: uncleaved closed (6ZGE), cleaved closed (6ZGI), one RBD erect (6ZGG) and cleaved

3.2.3 Mutations and high local topological free energy
In this section we compare the experimentally reported ability of a mutation to impact
3-dimensional rearrangement and the local topological free energy at that site for SARS
and SARS-CoV-2 known mutations. Our results are shown in Tables 2 and 3 in SI. In the
following all high LTE conformations are in Writhe, unless stated otherwise.
Overall, we find that 75% of the mutations which are known experimentally to change the
3-dimensional properties of the spike protein are at residues in high local topological free
energy conformations. The effect on protein conformation of the new mutants that have
naturally arisen is to our knowledge undetermined. We find that only 42% of those natural
mutants occurred at residues in high local topological free energy conformations. However, we
note that the only one of the natural occurring mutants for which we have a crystal structure
is G614. We found that the residue 614 was in a high LTE in Torsion conformation in D614,
only in the open state, while it is found in a high LTE in Torsion conformation in the closed
mutant G614.

More precisely, mutations at SARS residues K968 and V969 (known as 2P a double proline
mutation) caused disruption of conformational changes upon binding [33]. We find both
residues in high local topological free energy conformations.
The cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2, residue A688, which has been identified as important
in viral rearrangement [27], is in a high local topological free energy conformation. The
residue 614 where the G614 natural mutation occurred is in a high local topological free
energy conformation in Torsion for D614 and G614 [14]. Also, residue 985 which is involved
in a stabilizing mutation, is in a high local topological free energy conformation [37]. In [28]
43 substitutions where studied. The most efficient was the HexaPro variant (involves 6
mutations), which stabilized the pre-fusion structure and produced high yield [28]. We find
two out of the six mutations composing HexaPro (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P, K986P,
V987P) to be in a high local topological free energy conformation before the mutation and
none to be in a high local topological free energy conformation after the mutation.
In [26], using a different method, specific sites for mutation that would change global
conformation were identified. These were a double cysteine mutant, S383C D985C (RBD
to S2 double mutant (rS2d)), a triple mutant, D398L S514L E516L (RBD to NTD (triple
mutant (rNt)), a double mutant, N866I A570L (subdomain 1 to S2 double mutant (u1S2d)), a
quadruple mutant, A570L T572I F855Y N856I (subdomain 1 to S2 quadruple mutant (u1S2q))
and finally, a double cysteine mutant, G669C and T866C, to link SD2 to S2 (subdomain 2
to S2 double mutant (u2S2d)). We found that out of these 5 mutants, 4 contained residues
in high local topological free energy conformations. Moreover, one of the most efficient
mutations contained 2 residues in a high local topological free energy conformation.
In [32], a combination of mutations were examined. Categorized by location the mutations
included N532P, T572I, D614N, D614G of SD1, and A942P, T941G, T941P, S943G, A944P,
A944G , and A892P, F888 and G880C, S884C and A893C, and K986P and V987P of the

C-terminus of HR1 [32]. We find residues 572, 614, 942, 943, 944, 884, 986, 987 are in high
local topological free energy conformations (884 in Torsion). A892P was reported to increase
closed trimers while A942 decreased closed trimers. The double proline mutation (2P) at
K986P and V987P stabilized the pre-fusion structure. K986P was reported to have higher
ACE2 binding affinity while D614N and T572I reported to have low binding affinity [32].
The top 10 naturally prevalent mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (the recently
discovered UK and South African mutations [22, 57]) are shown in Table 4. These mutations
are are believed to increase infectivity and transmission and the majority of them are located
in S1 [61]. The precise impact of these mutations is not yet clear but current data suggests
that these mutations may increase both transmission and virulence of the virus. Both the
UK and South African variants are believed to increase the binding affinity because some are
located within the receptor binding motif of the RBD, residues which directly bind to the
ACE2 receptor. The UK variant is reported to contain several mutations including deletion
mutations (at residues 69, 70, 144) and substitution mutations (at 501, 570, 614, 681, 716,
982, 1118), shown in Table 4. One of these residues, residue 570, is in a high local topological
free energy conformation. The South African variant, involves N501Y, E484K, and K417N.
We find none of these residues to be in high local topological free energy conformations before
the mutation.

4 Discussion
We used the local topology/geometry of protein crystal structures alone to associate a local
topological free energy to the protein backbone. We find that total local topological free
energy decreases from pre- to post-fusion. In addition the total local topological free energy
of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion decreases continuously in the steps leading

to protein rearrangement, in agreement with a transition to an energetically more stable
state. We found that the total local topological free energy of the G614 mutant was much
higher than the D614 and HexaPro mutants. Experimental results have shown that the G614
mutant is more unstable compared to the D614 and HexaPro mutants. This finding further
supports that the purely topological free energy can quantify protein stability.
The distribution of the local topological free energy in the domains of the spike protein
changes from closed to open states and from pre- to post-fusion. Our results suggest that
high total local topological free energy in domains indicates activity of the domain in protein
rearrangement.
DFT calculations showed that local conformations of the spike protein of medium/low
LTE relax to conformations with even lower LTE, while the conformations with high LTE
relax to both lower and higher LTE conformations. This further supports that the high LTE
conformations are more unstable. Comparing to experimental data of mutations known to
enhance or obstruct protein rearrangement and stability of the Spike protein, we find that
most of the mutations reported to alter protein conformation are at residues in high local
topological free energy conformations.

6.4 Domains of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein
SARS-CoV-2 is a Class I fusion protein. It is composed of two subunits, the binding subunit
(S1) and the fusion subunit (S2). Upon triggering by low pH or protein interaction or cleavage
, the binding subunit is responsible for the binding of the virus to the host cell receptor which
then allows for an irreversible structural rearrangement. The fusion subunit is responsible for
facilitating fusion. The two subunits are connected by an S1 /S2 cleavage site.

S1 is composed by the receptor binding subunit, also called receptor binding domain (RBD)
and sometimes also by the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD).
S1 dissociates from the rest of the viral protein from pre- to post-fusion. S2 is composed by
a fusion peptide (FP) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) which both are used to insert
into opposite membranes to join the membranes together. Other domains exist which we
denote as domains with an associated number (we denote DN, where D is domain and N is a
number). For SARS-CoV-2, additional domains in S2 include the heptad repeat region (HR1
and HR2), central helix (CH), cytoplasm domain (CD) and subdomain 3 (SD3). The HR and
SD3 (post-fusion [20]) are domains located at the tail of the protein. HR1 rearranges during
fusion in a fashion that plunges the FP into the host membrane. HR2, located at the tail
of the protein, folds to bring the viral membrane to close proximity to the host membrane
during fusion [30].
