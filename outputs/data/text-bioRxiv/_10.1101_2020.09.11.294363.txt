Natural MHV-A59 mouse coronavirus infection mimics COVID-19 in elderly.

Elderly have the greatest risk of death from COVID-19. Here, Ryu et al report an aging mouse
model of coronavirus infection that recapitulates clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 seen in elderly.
The increased severity of infection in aged animals involved increased inflammasome activation
and loss of γδ T cells that was corrected by ketogenic diet.

SUMMARY
Increasing age is the strongest predictor of risk of COVID-19 severity. Unregulated cytokine
storm together with impaired immunometabolic response leads to highest mortality in elderly
infected with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate how aging compromises defense against COVID-19,
we developed a model of natural murine beta coronavirus (mCoV) infection with mouse hepatitis
virus strain MHV-A59 (mCoV-A59) that recapitulated majority of clinical hallmarks of COVID19. Aged mCoV-A59-infected mice have increased mortality and higher systemic inflammation
in the heart, adipose tissue and hypothalamus, including neutrophilia and loss of γδ T cells in
lungs. Ketogenic diet increases beta-hydroxybutyrate, expands tissue protective γδ T cells,
deactivates the inflammasome and decreases pathogenic monocytes in lungs of infected aged
mice. These data underscore the value of mCoV-A59 model to test mechanism and establishes
harnessing of the ketogenic immunometabolic checkpoint as a potential treatment against
COVID-19 in the elderly.

INTRODUCTION
Aging-driven reduced resilience to infections is dependent in part on the restricted T cell
repertoire diversity together with impaired T and B cell activation as well as inflammasomedriven low-grade systemic inflammation that compromises innate immune function (Akbar and
Gilroy, 2020; Camell et al., 2017; Youm et al., 2013). Consequently, 80 percent of deaths due to
COVID-19 in US are in adults > 65 years old (https://www.cdc.gov/) and aging is the strongest
factor to increase infection fatality (Pastor-Barriuso et al., 2020; Perez-Saez et al., 2020; Ward et
al., 2020). Lack of an aging animal model that mimics SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology has been
a major limitation in the effort to determine the mechanism of disease and to develop effective
therapeutics for the elderly. Inability of mouse ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV-2 is a significant
hurdle in understanding the basic mechanism of COVID-19. Accordingly, several approaches
have been employed to develop models including introduction of human-ACE2 in mice and
transient induction of hACE2 through adenoviral-associated vectors. These models have begun
to yield important information on the mechanism of disease development. For example,
epithelial cell specific induction of hACE2 (K18-hACE2) as a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection
demonstrated that post intranasal inoculation, animals develop lung inflammation and
pneumonia driven by infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils and T cells (Winkler et al., 2020).
Also, initial studies that employ lung ciliated epithelial cell-specific HFH4/FOXJ1 promoter
driven hACE2 transgenic mice show SARS-CoV-2 infection induces weight loss, lung
inflammation and approximately 50% mortality rate, suggesting the usefulness of this model to
understand the mechanism of immune dysregulation (Jiang et al., 2020). However, significant
hurdles remain to understand the mechanism and test therapeutic interventions that are relevant
to disease severity in elderly, as complicated breeding and specific mutations need to be

introduced in hACE2 transgenic strains in addition to the time required to age these models. The
mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 based on adeno-associated virus (AAV)–mediated expression of
hACE2 may allow circumvention of the above constrains. The delivery of hACE2 into the
respiratory tract of C57BL/6 mice with AAV9 causes a productive infection as revealed by >200
fold increase in SARS-CoV-2 RNA and show similar interferon gene expression signatures as
COVID-19 patients (Israelow et al., 2020). However, in young wild-type mice, this model
induces mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and does not cause neutrophilia,
weight loss or lethality (Israelow et al., 2020). Other studies using replication deficient
adenovirus-mediated transduction of hACE in mice and infection with SARS-CoV-2 produced
20% weight-loss including lung inflammation (Hassan et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020).
Furthermore, genetic remodeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain that allow
interaction with mACE demonstrated peribronchiolar lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates and
epithelial damage but no weight-loss in infected mice (Dinnon et al., 2020). Moreover, middle
aged female mice (one year old, analogous to approx. 43 year old human), display greater lung
pathology and loss of function post infection with 10% weight-loss followed by spontaneous
recovery 7 days post infection (Dinnon et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear if this model
replicates the clinical, systemic inflammation and immunological response and mortality
observed in COVID-19.
The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-CoV-2 are both ARDS-related beta
coronaviruses with a high degree of homology (Gorbalenya et al., 2020). Until the emergence of
SARS-CoV-2, the natural infection with MHV mouse coronavirus-A59 (mCoV-A59) has
traditionally been thought to be of minor relevance to human disease and largely been a primary
veterinary concern to maintain the specific-pathogen free status of mouse research facilities

(Hickman and Thompson, 2004). However, lack of an aging mouse model of COVID-19
necessitates re-evaluation of mCoV-A59 to investigate the mechanism of multi-organ
inflammation, morbidity and mortality caused by the disease. Importantly, the mCoV-A59
utilizes the entry receptor CEACAM1, which is expressed on respiratory epithelium, but also on
enterocytes, endothelial cells, and neurons, much like ACE2 (Godfraind et al., 1995) thus
allowing the study of wide-ranging systemic impacts of infection. Moreover, natural infection
with mCoV-A59 causes ARDS in C57BL/6J animals, while all other MHV strains require the
A/J or type-I interferon-deficient background, for the development of severe disease (De
Albuquerque et al., 2006; Khanolkar et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2014) limiting their use. Lastly,
another major practical advantage of natural infection with mCoV-A59 mouse model is that it
does not require limited BSL3 facilities, thus allowing the allocation of precious world-wide
BSL3 specialized laboratory space to be prioritized for human SARS-CoV-2 virus studies in
primates and other models, which cannot be achieved by using mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2
models.
Aging-induced chronic inflammation in the absence of overt infections is predominantly
driven by the NLRP3 inflammasome (Bauernfeind et al., 2016; Camell et al., 2017; Youm et al.,
2013), a myeloid cell-expressed multiprotein complex that senses pathogen associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) and danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to cause the processing
and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. There is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection
activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (Siu et al., 2019) with increased levels of IL-18 and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels due to inflammasome mediated pyroptotic cell death (Lucas et al.,
2020; Zhou et al., 2020). It is now known that increased glycolysis, which activates
inflammasome is associated with worsened COVID-19 outcome (Codo et al., 2020). This raises

the question whether the substrate switch from glycolysis-to-ketogenesis, can be employed to
stave off COVID-19 in high risk elderly population. Here, we establish that intranasal infection
with mCoV-A59 recapitulates clinical features of COVID-19 seen in elderly and demonstrate
that ketone metabolites protect against disease through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and
expansion of protective γδ T cells in lungs.

RESULTS
mCoV-A59 infection in aged mice mimics COVID-19 severity
To determine the underlying deficits in immune and inflammatory response in aging, we
investigated the impact of mCoV-A59 intranasal inoculation on adult (2-6 month) and old male
mice (20-24 month) (Figure 1A). The LD-0 infectious dose of mCoV-A59 in adult (PFU 7e3)
caused 100 percent lethality in aged mice (Figure 1B). Compared to adults, the old infected mice
displayed greater weight-loss (Figure 1C), hypoxemia (Figure 1D), and anorexia (Figure 1E)
without a significant difference in viral load in lungs (Figure S1A). Interestingly, aging led to a
significant reduction in CD4, CD4:CD8 ratio (Figure 1F and Figure S1B) and ϒδ T cells (Figure
1G and Figure S1C) in lungs and spleen (Figure S1D) with increased neutrophils (Figure 1H),
Ly6Chi monocytes (Figure 1I and S1E) and no change in eosinophils (Figure S1F). In addition,
the lungs of old infected mice displayed increased frequency of CD64+MerTK+ cells (Figure 1J
and S1E) with no significant differences in the total population of alveolar or interstitial
macrophages (Figure S1G and S1H).
Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the dissemination of the viral particles in
pneumocytes in lungs (Figure 2A). Following mCoV-A59 inoculation, IHC analyses by HE and
MSB staining, in both 6 month and 20-24-month old mice, there is perivascular inflammation

(arrows, arrowhead) as well as perivascular edema (*) and increased perivascular
collagen/fibrosis (MSB, blue) that is more severe in the 20-24-month mCoV-A59 infected mice
(Figure 2B). Further, 20-24 month old mice inoculated with mCoV-A59 have dense foci visible
at low power (box) and amphophilic material (fibrosis) with few scattered brightly eosinophilic
erythrocytes (grey arrowhead) admixed with lymphocytes and plasma cells. By MSB stain, at
higher power this same focus (***) in the 20-24 month infected mice revealed that the end of a
small blood vessel (BV) terminates in to a mass of collapsed alveoli, without obvious septa
admixed with inflammatory cells, disorganized fibrin/collagen fibers (blue) suggestive of ante
mortem pulmonary thrombosis in contrast to post mortem blood clots where erythrocytes are
yellow (** MSB, yellow) (Figure 2B). Taken together, consistent with ARDS, the lungs of aged
mice infected with mCoV-A59 had increased foci of inflammation, immune cell infiltration,
perivascular edema, hyaline membrane formation and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia,
organizing pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, and occasional hemorrhage and microthrombi,
affecting approximately 75% of the lungs (Figure 2B).

Aging enhances systemic inflammatory response in A59 (mCoV) infected mice
We next investigated whether mCoV-A59 infection in aged mice mimics the hyperinflammatory
systemic response seen in elderly patients infected with COVID-19. Compared to young
animals, old mice infected with equivalent doses of mCoV-A59 displayed significant increase in
circulating IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6 (Figure 3A-C) and MCP-1 without affecting MIP-1β (Figure S2A
and S2B). Similar to COVID-19, the infection with mCoV-A59 caused increased cardiac
inflammation in old mice as evaluated by greater number of infiltrating CD68+ myeloid cells
(Figure 3D).

Given that increased visceral adiposity is a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and
expression of ACE2 is upregulated in adipocytes of obese and diabetic patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (Kruglikov and Scherer, 2020), we next studied whether mCoV-A59 infection
affects adipose tissue. Given the prevalence of obesity is 10% among younger adults aged 20-39,
45% among adults aged 40-59 years and 43% among older adults aged 60 and over (Hales et al.,
2020) we investigated adipose tissue inflammation as a potential mechanism that contributes to
infection severity in the aged. Interestingly, consistent with the prior findings that adipose tissue
can harbor several viruses (Damouche et al., 2015), the mCoV-A59 RNA was detectable in VAT
(Figure 3E). Despite similar viral loads, VAT of aged infected mice had significantly higher
levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6 (Figure 3F-H). Moreover,
compared to young mice, old animals infected with mCoV-A59 had increased Caspase-1
cleavage (p20 active heterodimer), a marker of inflammasome activation (Figure 3I and S2C). In
addition, similar to SARS-CoV-2 invasiveness in CNS, the mCoV-A59 was detectable in the
hypothalamus (Figure 3J). Compared to adults, the hypothalamus of aged infected mice showed
increased expression of TNFα and Caspase-1 (Figure 3K and L) with no significant differences
in IL-1β, IL-6 (Figure 3M and N) and Nlrp3 (Figure S2D). Infection in both young and aged
mice caused significant increases in markers of astrogliosis and microglia activation (Figure S2E
and F). Interestingly, mCoV-A59 reduced the mRNA expression of orexigenic neuropeptide-Y
(NPY) (Figure S2E and F), consistent with the fact that infected mice display anorexia (Figure
1C and E). However, mCoV-A59 infection completely abolished the expression of preopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamus, a transcript expressed by POMC neurons,
which is involved in the control of the autonomic nervous system and integrative physiology.

Therefore, further investigation will be necessary to test the involvement of the hypothalamus in
the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and organ failure due to alterations in autonomic nervous system.

Ketogenic diet mediated protection against A59 (mCoV) infection in aging is coupled to
inflammasome deactivation
Given the switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation reprograms the myeloid cell from proinflammatory to tissue reparative phenotype during infections (Ayres, 2020; Buck et al., 2017;
Galván-Peña and O’Neill, 2014), we next investigated whether mCoV-A59-driven
hyperinflammatory response in aging can be targeted through immunometabolic approaches.
Hepatic ketogenesis, a process downstream of lipolysis that converts long-chain fatty acids into
short chain β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) as a preferential fatty acid fuel during starvation or
glucoprivic states, inhibits the Nlrp3 inflammasome activation (Youm et al., 2015) and protects
against influenza infection induced mortality in mice (Goldberg et al., 2019). Moreover, given
our recent findings that ketogenesis inhibits inflammation and expands tissue resident ϒδ T cells
(Goldberg et al., 2019) while SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients is associated with depletion of
ϒδ T cells (Lei et al., 2020; Rijkers et al., 2020), we next tested whether elevating BHB by
feeding a ketogenic diet (KD) protects against mCoV-A59-driven inflammatory damage in aged
mice. We infected bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) with mCoV-A59 in vitro in
TLR4 (Figure 4A and S3A) and TLR1/2 primed cells (Figure 4B and S3B). Infection with
mCoV-A59 caused robust activation of inflammasome as measured by cleavage of active IL-1β
(p17) in BMDM supernatants (Figure 4A and B) as well as in cell lysates (Figure S3A and B).
Given our prior findings that ketone metabolites specifically inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome

in response to sterile DAMPs such as ATP, ceramides, silica and urate crystals (Youm et al.,
2015), we next tested whether BHB impacts inflammasome activation caused by mCoV-A59.
Interestingly, BHB treatment reduced pro and active cleaved IL-1β (p17) in both
conditions when protein level was measured in the supernatant (Figure 4A and B) and cell lysate
(Figure S3A and B). Mechanistically, post mCoV-A59 infection, the BHB reduced the
oligomerization of ASC, which is an adaptor protein required for the assembly of the
inflammasome complex (Figure 4C and D). This data provides evidence that the ketone
metabolite BHB can lower inflammation in response to coronavirus infection and deactivate the
inflammasome. However, inflammasome activation is also required for mounting adequate
immune response against pathogens including certain viruses. Therefore, we next investigated if
induction of ketogenesis and ketolysis in vivo by feeding a diet rich in fat and low in
carbohydrates that elevates BHB level impacts inflammasome and host defense against mCoVA59 infection in aged mice.
Ketogenesis is dependent on hydrolysis of triglycerides and conversion of long chain
fatty acids in liver into short chain fatty acid BHB that serves as primary source of ATP for heart
and brain when glucose is limiting. Aging is associated with impaired lipid metabolism which
includes reduced lipolysis that generates free fatty acids that are essential substrates for BHB
production. Thus, it is unclear whether in context of severe infection and aging, if sufficient
ketogenesis can be induced. To test this, the aged male mice (20-21 months old) were fed a KD
or control diet for 5 days and then intranasally infected with mCoV-A59 (Figure 4E). Despite
mCoV-A59’s known effects in causing hepatic inflammation (Navas et al., 2001), we observed
that compared to chow fed animals, old KD fed mice achieved mild physiological ketosis
between 0.6 to 1mM over the course of infection for one week (Figure S3C). Compared to chow

fed animals, the mCoV-A59 infected mice fed KD displayed similar levels of food intake, blood
glucose, core-body temperature, heart rate, and respiration (Figure S3D-I). Interestingly, mCoVA59 infected KD fed mice were protected from infection-induced weight-loss and hypoxemia
(Figure 4F and G). Importantly, consistent with in vitro data, KD feeding caused significant
reduction in inflammasome activation in the VAT (Figure 4H), a major source of inflammation
in aging. Together, these data show that KD lowers exuberant inflammasome activation in old
mice and can potentially be therapeutically employed.

Induction of ketogenic substrate switch inhibits systemic inflammation in aged mCoV-A59
infection
The elderly COVID-19 patients exhibit multi-organ failure with systemic viremia and
inflammation. Therefore, we next investigated the impact of KD on the inflammatory response in
lungs, adipose tissue and hypothalamus in old mice post mCov-A59 infection.
Consistent with the improved clinical outcome and protection afforded by ketone bodies in
infected mice, we found that KD-fed mice inoculated with mCoV-A59 had significantly reduced
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6 in lung, VAT and
hypothalamus (Figure 5A-C). Aging and mCoV-A59 increases inflammasome activation which
is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (Vijay et al., 2017; Youm et al.,
2013). The SARS-CoV open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) and ORF8b activates the NLRP3
inflammasome (Siu et al., 2019) by inducing ER stress and lysosomal damage (Shi et al., 2019).
Moreover, ability of bats to harbor multiple viruses including coronaviruses is due to splicevariants in the LRR domain of NLRP3 which prevents inflammasome mediated inflammatory
damage (Ahn et al., 2019). Interestingly, in the aging mouse model of mCoV-A59 infection, KD

significantly lowered NLRP3 and Caspase-1 mRNA in lung, VAT and hypothalamus (Figure 5D
and E) and decreased myeloid cell infiltration in heart (Figure 5F). The ketogenesis in infected
old mice did not affect the frequency of CD4, CD8 effector memory or macrophage subsets in
lungs suggesting that reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines was not a reflection of reduced
infiltration of these cell types (Figure S4). Interestingly, we found that KD feeding rescued
mCoV-A59-induced depletion of ϒδ T cell in lungs of aged mice (Figure 5G and S4A).

Ketogenesis induces protective γδ T cells and decreases myeloid cell subset in mCoV-A59
infected old mice
To determine the mechanism of ketogenesis-induced protection from mCoV-A59 driven
inflammatory damage in aging, we next investigated the transcriptional changes in lung at the
single-cell level. The scRNA sequencing of whole lung tissues (Figure 6A) found that KD
feeding in old infected mice caused significant increase in goblet cells (Figure 6B), expansion of
ϒδ T cells (Figure 6B) and significant decrease in proliferative cell subsets and monocyte
populations (Figure 6B). Comparison with scRNA-seq of the lungs from young and old noninfected animals highlighted that only loss of proliferative myeloid cells was associated with the
baseline aging process (Figure S5), while other age-specific changes in cellular subpopulations
emerged as a result of interaction between virus and host. Moreover, the old mice showed
reduced interferon responses, suggesting increased vulnerability to the viral infection (Figure
S5). Interestingly, some of the most striking changes occurred in T cells, where ketogenesis led
to a substantial increase in ϒδ but not αβ T cells (Figure 6C and Figure S6B). To understand
whether expansion of ϒδ T cells was also accompanied by the changes in their regulatory
programs, we sorted the lung ϒδ T cells from aged mice fed chow diet and KD and conducted

bulk RNA sequencing to determine the mechanism of potential tissue protective effects of these
cells in mCoV-A59 infection. We found that KD in aging significantly increased the genes
associated with reduced inflammation (Figure 6D), increased lipoprotein remodeling and
downregulation of TLR signaling, Plk1 and aurora B signaling pathways in ϒδ T cells (Figure
6E). Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed that lung ϒδ T cells from ketogenic mCoV-A59
infected old mice displayed elevated respiratory electron transport and complex I biogenesis
(Figure 6E). In addition, Golgi to ER retrograde transport and cell cycle are downregulated,
suggesting the reduced activation status of ϒδ T cell (Figure 6E). This may indicate that ϒδ T
cells expanded with KD are functionally more homeostatic and immune protective against
mCoV-A59 infection.
Zooming in into monocyte subpopulation we observed three distinct monocyte clusters
(Figure 6F), characterized by Ifi44, Lmna, and Cd300e respectively (Figure 6G). Strikingly,
ketogenesis-induced change in the monocyte compartment was driven by a loss of cluster 1
(characterized by high levels of Chil3, Lmna, Il1r2, Lcn2, Cd33, Cd24a, Figure 6H and Figure
S6D and E). In addition, the loss of monocyte subpopulation was observed in cells with low
interferon-response further suggesting the immune protective response induction post
ketogenesis in infected mice. This is an intriguing finding that is consistent with recent
observations that dietary interventions can impact plasticity of the monocyte pool in both mouse
and human (Collins et al., 2019; Jordan et al., 2019).

responses together with thymic demise and restriction of T cell repertoire diversity all contribute
to increased risk of infections and vaccination failures in elderly (Akbar and Gilroy, 2020; Frasca
et al., 2020; Goldberg and Dixit, 2015; Goronzy and Weyand, 2019). It is likely that multiple
mechanisms partake in aging-induced mortality and morbidity to SARS-CoV-2. However, study
of immunometabolic mechanisms that control aberrant inflammatory response in elderly
COVID-19 patients are hindered due to lack of availability of an aging mouse model of disease
that recapitulates the key features of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology and multi-organ
inflammation. Despite the severity of this viral infection, it is currently unclear what underlies
the symptom diversity and the mortality of this pandemic. Epidemiological data strongly support
that elderly and aged individuals with late-onset chronic diseases—including diabetes, obesity,
heart conditions, pulmonary dysfunctions and cancer—present a much higher disease severity
compared to young healthy adults (Cai et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020). These observations
suggest that it is the vulnerability of the various tissues that occur in these chronic conditions that
predispose elderly to develop severe forms of COVID-19.
Rodent CoVs are natural, highly contagious pathogens of mice and rats (Compton et al.,
2003; Compton et al., 1993). They are efficient and safe platforms for recapitulating COVID-19
and examining factors and interventions that impact disease. These models enable basic and
translational COVID-19 studies by minimizing studies requiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby
conserving and reserving limited BSL-3 space for studies using the most promising candidates in
a homologous SARS-CoV-2 model. Among the diverse rodent CoVs, Mouse Hepatitis Virus
(MHV) is a collection of mouse CoV strains which have clinical diseases ranging from clinically
silent (enterotropic) to mortality (polytropic/respiratory tropic). Of particular interest for
COVID-19 are the strains of MHV that are respiratory tropic (Yang et al., 2014). Given, these

advantages, MHV mCoV-A59 infection in C57BL/6 mice can be a powerful tool to rapidly study
the disease as well as test therapeutic interventions. We demonstrate that compared to all
reported models (Dinnon et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Israelow et al., 2020; Jiang et al.,
2020; Sun et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020), MHV mCoV-A59 infection recapitulates severe
features of COVID-19 that includes, up to 30% weight-loss, sickness behavior exemplified by
anorexia, loss of oxygen saturation, lung pathology including neutrophilia, monocytosis, loss of
γδ T cells, lymphopenia, increase in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, hypothalamic,
adipose and cardiac inflammation and inflammasome activation. Importantly, LD0 dose of MHV
mCoV-A59 induces 100% lethality in 2 year old male mice, suggesting that this model allows
investigation of COVID-19 relevant immunometabolic mechanisms that control disease
development and severity with aging.
Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome has been demonstrated to be an important driver
of aging-induced chronic inflammation and organ damage (Bauernfeind et al., 2016; Camell et
al., 2017; Youm et al., 2013). COVID-19 patients have inflammasome dependent pyroptosis and
increase in IL-18 (Lucas et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Consistent with the hypothesis that
aging may exacerbate inflammasome activation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, our data
demonstrates that in vivo, mCoV infection increases NLRP3 inflammasome mediated
inflammation. Emerging evidence demonstrates that ability of bats to harbor multiple viruses
including coronaviruses is due to splice-variants in the LRR domain of NLRP3 which prevents
inflammasome mediated inflammatory damage (Ahn et al., 2019). Furthermore, recent study
shows that MHV-A59 also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro bone marrow derived
macrophages (Zheng et al., 2020). In addition severe cases of COVID-19 are accompanied with
dyregulation of monocyte populations with increased level of S100A8/A9 or calprotectin

(Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020), which can prime and induce the
inflammasome activation (Goldberg et al., 2017). These data underscore that enhanced innate
immune tolerance mediated by inflammasome deactivation maybe an important strategy against
COVID-19.
The integrated immunometabolic response (IIMR) is critical in regulating the setpoint of
protective versus pathogenic inflammatory response (Lee and Dixit, 2020). The IIMR involves
sensing of nutrient balance by neuronal (sympathetic and sensory innervation) and humoral
signals (e.g. hormones and cytokines) between the CNS and peripheral tissues that allow the host
to prioritize storage and/or utilize substrates for tissue growth, maintenance and protective
inflammatory responses. Peripheral immune cells, both in circulation and those residing within
tissues, are subject to regulation by the metabolic status of the host. Ketone bodies, BHB and
acetoacetate are produced during starvation to support the survival of host by serving as an
alternative energy substrate when glycogen reserves are depleted (Newman and Verdin, 2017).
Classically, ketone bodies are considered essential metabolic fuels for key tissues such as the
brain and heart (Puchalska and Crawford, 2017; Veech et al., 2017). However, there is increasing
evidence that immune cells can also be profoundly regulated by ketone bodies (Youm et al,
2015, Goldberg et al 2020). For example, stable isotope tracing revealed that macrophage
oxidation of liver-derived AcAc was essential for protection against liver fibrosis (Puchalska et
al., 2019). Given our past findings that ketone bodies inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation
induced by sterile DAMPs, we next hypothesized that coronavirus mediated inflammasome
activation and disease severity in aging could be improved by BHB driven improved metabolic
efficiency and NLRP3 deactivation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that BHB inhibits
the mCoV-A59 induced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and KD reduces caspase-1 cleavage as

well as decreases gene expression of inflammasome components. We next investigated the
mechanism of protection elicited by KD that is relevant to aging. Interestingly, scRNA
sequencing analyses of lung homogenates of old mice fed KD revealed robust expansion of
immunoprotective γδ T cells, which are reported to decline in COVID-19 patients (Lei et al.,
2020; Rijkers et al., 2020). The KD activated the mitochondrial function as evidenced by
enhanced complex-1 biogenesis and upregulation of ETC in immunoprotective γδ T cells.
Moreover, the KD feeding blocked infiltration of pathogenic monocyte subset in lungs that has
high S100A8/9 and low interferon expression.
Our data shows that the mCoV-A59 murine model offers an efficient and biosafety level2 platform for recapitulating COVID-19 to test mechanism of age-related immune decline and
can thereby fast-track testing of interventions that impact disease outcome. Our findings assumes
strong clinical significance as recent studies, demonstrate that γδ T cells were severely depleted
in COVID-19 patients in two highly variable cohorts and disease progression was correlated with
near ablation of Vγ9Vδ2 cells that are dominant subtype of circulating γδ T cells (Laing et al.,
2020). Taken together these data demonstrate that a ketogenic immunometabolic switch protects
against mCoV-A59 driven COVID in mice and this anti-inflammatory response in lung is
coupled with reduction of inflammasome activation, restoration of protective ϒδ T cells and
remodeling of the pool of the inflammatory monocytes. Finally, our results suggest that acutely
switching infected or at-risk elderly patients to a KD may ameliorate COVID-19 and, therefore,
is a relatively accessible and affordable intervention that can be promptly applied in most clinical
settings.

LIMITATIONS
Mouse remains imperfect to model human biology and disease. Instead of following the current
approaches to make human SARS-CoV-2 amenable to infecting an unnatural murine host with
unknown biological compatibility, we focused on natural mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59
because like SARS-CoV-2, it belongs to the family of ARDS-related beta coronaviruses that are
highly homologous. However, the obvious limitation of the model is that MHV-A59 is not
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although, both these beta coronaviruses display high degree of homology,
MHV-A59 uses CEACAM1 instead of ACE2 for binding and infectivity. However, cellular
expression of CEACAM1 is similar to ACE2 in humans and similarity of viral ORFs offer
significant advantages in studying tissue responses. Like most models of disease, this study
shows that not all features of SARS-CoV-2 infection seen in humans are seen in mice. This
includes lack of development of fever instead mice become hypothermic. Also, despite monocyte
infiltration in heart, the aged mice did not die due to cardiac failure and displayed normal heart
rate. mCoV-A59 virus induced hypothalamic inflammation and led to anorexia that included
reduction in orexigenic NPY but almost complete loss of POMC gene expression. It remains
unclear, if this alters POMC derived peptides including melanocortins and endogenous opioids
peptides, in addition these data suggest potential dysregulation of autonomic nervous system
which can play a role in organ failure post infection. In terms of mechanism, our data shows that
the inflammasome is activated in infection and KD-induced protection is associated with NLRP3
inflammasome deactivation. Future studies are required to test if aged NLRP3 deficient mice are
protected from mCoV-A59 or if absence of γδ T cell increases mortality.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice
All mice used in this study were C57BL/6 mice. Old mice (20-24 month old) were received from
NIA, maintained in our laboratory. Young mice (2-6 month old) were from NIA or purchased
from Jackson Laboratories or bred in our laboratory. The mice were housed in specific pathogenfree facilities with free access to sterile water through Yale Animal Resources Center. Mice were
fed a standard vivarium chow (Harlan 2018s) or a ketogenic diet (Envigo, TD.190049) for
indicated time. The mice were housed under 12 h light/dark cycles. All experiments and animal
use were conducted in compliance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) at Yale University.
METHOD DETAILS
Viral infection
MHV-A59 was purchased from Bei resources (NR-43000) and grown in BV2 cells. Mice were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine. 700 or 7000 PFU of MHV-A59
was delivered in 40ul PBS via intranasal inoculation. Vital signs were measured before and after
infection. Arterial oxygen saturation, breath rate, heart rate, and pulse distention were measured
in conscious, unrestrained mice via pulse oximetry using the MouseOx Plus (Starr Life Sciences
Corp.).
Electron Microscopy
Lungs were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, osmicated in 1% osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated in
ethanol. During dehydration, 1% uranyl acetate was added to the 70% ethanol to enhance
ultrastructural membrane contrast. After dehydration, the lungs were embedded in Durcupan and
ultrathin sections were cut on a Leica Ultra-Microtome, collected on Formvar-coated single-slot
grids, and analyzed with a Tecnai 12 Biotwin electron microscope (FEI).
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
H&E and MSB staining of lung tissues were performed on sections of formalin-fixed paraffinembedded at the Comparative Pathology Research core at Yale School of Medicine. For
immunohistochemistry, the hearts were harvested from MHV-A59 infected mice, fixed in 4%
PFA overnight and embedded in OCT after dehydration with 30% sucrose and serial sections of
aortic root were cut at 6 μm thickness using a cryostat. Sections were incubated at 4°C overnight
with CD68 (Serotec; #MCA1957) and Alexa Fluor™ 594 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher, A12381)
after blocking with blocker buffer (5% Donkey Serum, 0.5% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS)
for 1 hour at RT, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hour at RT. The stained sections were captured using a Carl Zeiss scanning
microscope Axiovert 200M imaging system and images were digitized under constant exposure
time, gain, and offset. Results are expressed as the percent of the total plaque area stained
measured with the Image J software (ImageJ version 1.51).

Plaque assay
L2 cell (1.5 mL of 6x105 cells/mL) were seeded on 6 well plates (Corning, 3516) in
supplemented DMEM and allowed to adhere overnight. Tissue samples were homogenized in
unsupplemented DMEM, and spun down at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatant was serially diluted
and 200 μL of each sample was added to aspirated L2 cells in 6 well plates. Plates were agitated
regularly for 1 hour before adding overlay media consisting of 1 part 1.2% Avicel and 1 part 2X
DMEM (Thermo Fisher, 12800) supplemented with 4% FBS (Thermo Fisher, A3840301),
Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122), MEM Non-Essential Amino Acids Solution (Gibco,
11140050), and HEPES (Gibco, 15630080). After a four-day incubation, cells were fixed in 10%
formaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich, 8187081000) diluted with PBS for 1 hour. Cells were then stained
in 1% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma Aldrich, C0775) for 1 hour, washed once in distilled water, and
then quantified for plaque formations.
Multiplex Cytokine Analyses
Serum cytokine and chemokine level was measured by ProcartaPlex multiplex assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). Assay was prepared following manufacture’s instruction. 25 µl of collected
serum from each mice in this study was used. Customized assay including IL-1β, TNF𝛼, IL-6,
MCP-1, and MIP-1β was used. Luminex xPONENT system was used to perform the assay.
qPCR
To extract and purify RNA from tissues, RNeasy Plus micro kit (Qiagen) and Direct-zol™ RNA
Miniprep Plus kit (Zymo Research) were used according to manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
was synthesized with isolated RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). To quantify
amount of mRNA, real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was done with the synthesized cDNA,
gene specific primers, and Power SYBR Green detection reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientific)
using the LightCycler 480 II (Roche). Analysis was done by DDCt method with measured values
from specific genes, the values were normalized with Gaphd gene as an endogenous control.
BMDM culture and in vitro viral infection
Bone marrow derived macrophage was cultured by collecting mouse femurs and tibias in
complete collecting media containing RPMI (Thermo Fischer Scientific), 10% FBS (Omega
Scientific), and 1% antibiotics/antimycotic (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Using needle and
syringe, bone marrow was flushed into new complete media, followed by red blood cells lysis by
ACK lyses buffer (Quality Biological). In 6 well plate, the collected cells were seeded to be
differentiated into macrophages incubated with 10 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D) and L929 (ATCC)
conditioned media. Cells were harvested on day 7, and seeded as 1x106 cell/well in 24 well plate
for experiments. To infect BMDM, MHV-A59 was incubated with BMDM as a MOI 1 (1:1) for
24 hour. For inflammasome activation, LPS (1ug/ml) or Pam3CSK4 (1ug/ml) were pre-treated
with or without BHB (1, 5, 10 mM) for 4 hour before MHV-A59 infection for 24 hour or ATP
(5mM) treatment for 1 hour.
Western Blotting
To prepare samples for western blotting, tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. RIPA buffer
with protease inhibitors were used to homogenize the tissues. After cell supernatant was
collected, cells were harvested by directly adding RIPA buffer on cell culture plate. After

quantification of protein amount by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), same amount of protein was
run on SDS-PAGE gel followed by transferring to nitrocellulose membrane. Specific primary
antibodies and appropriate secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used to probe
blots and bands were detected by ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce). The following
primary antibodies were used for experiments. Antibodies to Caspase-1 (1:250, Genentech), βactin (1:1,000, 4967L; Cell Signaling), IL-1β (1:1000, GTX74034, GeneTex), and ASC (1:1000,
AG-25B-0006, AdipoGen) were used.
ASC oligomerization assay
To detect ASC oligomers, cells were harvested in NP-40 lysis buffer which contains 20mM
HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitors. The
cells in lysis buffer were incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm at 4°C for 10
min. Supernatant was collected and kept for cell lysate western blotting. The pellet was vortexed
with 1 ml of NP-40 lysis buffer, and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The pellet was
incubated with 50ul of NP-40 lysis buffer and 1 ul of 200 mM DSS (disuccinimidyl suberate) for
30 min at room temperature, then centrifuged at 6,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The pellet with
SDS sample buffer and reducing reagent was loaded for western blotting.
Flow Cytometry
Lung was digested in RPMI (Thermo Fisher) with 0.5mg/ml Collagenase I (Worthington) and
0.2mg/ml DNase I (Roche) for 1 hour. Digested lung tissues were minced through 100 μm
strainer. Spleen was directly minced through 100 μm strainer. Minced tissues were additionally
filtered with 40 μm strainer after red blood cell lysis by ACK lysing buffer (Quality Biological).
After incubation with Fc Block CD16/32 antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific), the cells from
lung and spleen were further incubated with surface antibodies for 30 min on ice in the dark.
Washed cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). BD LSRII was used for Flow Cytometry and results were analyzed by FlowJo
software. The following antibodies were used for flow cytometry analysis to detect CD4 T cell,
CD8 T cell, γδ T cell, neutrophil, eosinophil, and macrophage: CD45-BV711, MerTK-FITC,
CD64-BV605, F4/80-eFluor450, Ly6C-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD11c-APC, CD169-PE, CD86-PE-Cy7,
CD3-BV605, CD4-PE-Cy7, CD8-eFluor450, TCR γ/δ-PE, Ly6G-APC, SiglecF-PerCP-Cy5.5,
CD62L-PerCP-Cy5.5, CD44-APC-Cy7.
Single-cell RNA sequencing
Lung cells were prepared as mentioned above for flow cytometry and equal amount of cells were
pooled as indicted in the experiments. Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were prepared at
Yale Center for Genome Analysis following manufacturer’s instruction (10x Genomics).
NovaSeq6000 was used for sequencing library read.
Alignment, barcode assignment and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting
The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (v3.0.2) (available at
https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-iscell-ranger) was used to perform sample demultiplexing, barcode processing, and single-cell 3’
counting. Cellranger mkfastq was used to demultiplex raw base call files from the NovaSeq6000
sequencer into sample-specific fastq files. Subsequently, fastq files for each sample were
processed with cellranger counts to align reads to the mouse reference (version mm10-3.0.0)
with default parameters.

Preprocessing analysis with Seurat package
For the analysis, the R (v3.5.0) package Seurat (v3.1.1) (Butler et al., 2018) was used. Cell
Ranger filtered genes by barcode expression matrices were used as analysis inputs. Samples were
pooled together using the merge function. The fraction of mitochondrial genes was calculated for
every cell, and cells with high (>5%) mitochondrial fraction were filtered out. Expression
measurements for each cell were normalized by total expression and then scaled to 10,000, after
that log normalization was performed (NormalizeData function). Two sources of unwanted
variation: UMI counts and fraction of mitochondrial reads – were removed with ScaleData
function. For both datasets platelet clusters as well as a cluster of degraded cells (no specific
signature and low UMI count) were removed and data was re-normalized without them. In case
of Old-Keto and Old-Chow dataset we additionally removed neutrophils, doublets, and red blood
cells.
Dimensionality reduction and clustering
The most variable genes were detected using the FindVariableGenes function. PCA was run only
using these genes. Cells are represented with UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection) plots. We applied RunUMAP function to normalized data, using first 15 PCA
components. For clustering, we used functions FindNeighbors and FindClusters that implement
SNN (shared nearest neighbor) modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm on top 20
PCA components using resolution of 0.3 for both datasets.
Identification of cluster-specific genes and marker-based classification
To identify marker genes, FindAllMarkers function was used with likelihood-ratio test for single
cell gene expression. For each cluster, only genes that were expressed in more than 10% of cells
with at least 0.1-fold difference (log-scale) were considered. For heatmap representation, mean
expression of markers inside each cluster calculated by AverageExpression function was used.
Single cell RNA-seq differential expression
To obtain differential expression between clusters, MAST test was performed via FindMarkers
function on genes expressed in at least 1% of cells in both sets of cells, and p-value adjustment
was done using a Bonferroni correction (Finak et al., 2015). Pathway analysis was performed
using clusterProfiler package (v3.12.0) (Yu et al., 2012) with Hallmark gene sets from MSigDB.
Significantly different genes were used (padj < 0.05) if percent difference between conditions
(|pct.1 – pct.2|) was over 1%. To visualize pathway expression for each cell z-scores of all
pathway genes were averaged.
Cell subsets analysis
To separate ab T cells and gs T cells we subset raw values of T cell (cluster 2), normalized and
clustered corresponding data separately as described above with clustering resolution 0.2.
Obtained subclusters were projected on the original UMAP, splitting cluster 2 in 2_1 (ab T
cells) and 2_2 (gs T cells). Monocyte clusters 0 and 1 were subset and re-analyzed in the same
manner with clustering resolution 0.3. UMAP was recalculated for monocytes only as shown in
Figure 6F.
Bulk RNA sequencing of sorted gδ T cells
Cells from lung were prepared as mentioned above for flow cytometry and γδ T cell was sorted
by flow cytometry (live CD45+ CD3+ CD4- CD8- TCR γ/δ+). RNA was isolated from sorted
cells using RNeasy Plus micro kit (Qiagen). Quality checked RNA was used for RNA
sequencing library preparation at Yale Center for Genome Analysis following manufacturer’s
instruction (Illumina). NovaSeq6000 was used for sequencing library read.

by FastQC (v0.11.8), MultiQC (v1.9) (Ewels et al., 2016), and Picard tools (v2.21.6).
Quantification was done using htseq-count function from HTSeq framework (v0.11.2): htseqcount -f bam -r pos -s no -t exon $BAM $ANNOTATION > $OUTPUT (Anders et al., 2014).
Differential expression analysis was done using DESeq function from DeSeq2 package (Love et
al., 2014) (v1.24.0) with default settings. Significance threshold was set to adjusted p-value <
0.05. Gene set enrichment analysis via fgsea R package (Sergushichev, 2016) (v1.10.0) was used
to identify enriched pathways and plot enrichment curves.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analysis
To calculate statistical significance, two-tailed Student’s t test was used. Level of significance
was indicated as follow. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001 respectively. All
statistical tests used 95% confidence interval and normal distribution of data was assumed.
Biological replication numbers for each experiment were indicated in each figure and figure
legend. Data were shown as mean ± S.E.M. GraphPad Prism software was used for all statistical
tests to analyze experimental results.
