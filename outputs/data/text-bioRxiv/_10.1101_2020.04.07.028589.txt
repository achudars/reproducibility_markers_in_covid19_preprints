Abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a major public health burden
around the world. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has infected over one million people worldwide as of April, 2020, and has led to
the deaths of nearly 300,000 people. No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently
exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The
IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a
noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a
variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2
replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 μM of MMPD, viral titers
were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop.
The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 μM significantly reduced viral
titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection. The results of this study provide
evidence that MMPD may be a viable treatment option for COVID-19.
Introduction: In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged out of Wuhan, China,
causing respiratory illness and occasional severe pneumonia. The virus spread rapidly around
the world, and in March of 2019 the disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization. At the time of writing, 1.3 million people around the world have been infected and
more than 70,000 people have died from the disease, named coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). In addition to the public health crisis, the economic impact from the pandemic
continues to worsen. Due to the novelty of the virus, no approved vaccines or treatments are
available. There is therefore an urgent need for the development of new countermeasures.
Drugs with history of being tested in human patients or used for treatment of other conditions
offer the most expedient option, and several such drugs are currently being tested for efficacy
against SARS-CoV-2, including many broad-spectrum antivirals. One such antiviral,
merimepodib (MMPD), has already being tested against hepatitis C in patients as well as
against many emerging RNA viruses in cell culture, including Zika, Ebola, Lassa, Junin, and

chikungunya viruses (1). MMPD noncompetitively inhibits inosine-5'-monophosphate
dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of guanosine
nucleotides (2, 3). In vitro, inhibition can be reversed by addition of exogenous guanosine (4).
Early work suggests that IMPDH may directly interact with SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, perhaps
indicating that drugs targeting IMPDH such as MMPD might have an impact on viral replication
(5). This drug, while still investigational, is considered to be safe in humans. More than 300
patients have received the drug in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. Many were treated for six
months. In this study, we aimed to examine whether MMPD may be active in reducing SARSCoV-2 replication.
Materials & Methods
Cells and Viruses
Vero cells (CCL-81, ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (Hyclone)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution (Hyclone).
SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 was provided by the World Reference Center for Emerging
Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA) and was originally obtained from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). The virus was subsequently titrated and passaged once more
on Vero cells, grown in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin
solution. All experiments were conducted at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)
approved biosafety level-three (BSL-3) laboratories and all personnel undergo routine medical
surveillance.
Compound pretreatment and infection
Vero cells were pretreated, 1 mL per well, with DMEM media containing the indicated
concentrations of either merimepodib or T-705 and incubated at 37°C for either 4 hours or
overnight. The media was then removed and cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI
of 0.05. Viral inoculum was premixed with compounds (0.1 mL/well). After 1 hour of incubation
at 37°C, wells were washed 3 times with DMEM media and 1 mL of media containing the
indicated compound doses was added back to each well. Cells were incubated at 37°C and
samples collected at 0, 16, and 24 hours post-infection. Collected timepoint media was
replaced with an equal amount of media containing compound. The SARS-CoV-2 titer was
determined for each sample collected at 0, 16, and 24 hours post-infection via TCID50 in Vero
cells. Briefly, collected supernatant was serially diluted six times (10 -6) in DMEM media. 100 μl

of each dilution was added in quadruplicates to Vero cells grown in a 96-well plate. Cells were
incubated 4 days at 37°C. Cells were then fixed with 10% formalin for 30 minutes and stained
for 5 minutes with crystal violet. Biological triplicates were harvested at each timepoint and
statistical significance was determined via one-tailed t-test.
Results
Previous growth kinetics studies using an MOI of 0.01 in Vero cells have indicated that viral
titers peak at around 24 hours post-infection and plateau through 48 hours post-infection (6). At
both 16 and 24 hours post-infection, during the exponential phase of the viral growth curve, 10
μM MMPD reduced viral titers by around 3 logs when cells were pretreated overnight (p-value =
<0.0001). 4 hours of pretreatment with MMPD resulted in a nearly 2.5-log decrease in viral
titers (p-value = 0.0004). The antiviral effect is dose-dependent, with lower doses of 5 and 3.3
μM of MMPD reducing viral titers by a more modest, but still significant degree. At 24 hours
post-infection, 5 μM MMPD applied 4 hours before infection reduced viral titers by 1.5 logs (pvalue = 0.0004), while 3.3 μM added 4 hours before infection reduced viral titers by a little over
1 log (p-value = 0.001).
We also tested T-705, another broad-spectrum antiviral that acts as a nucleoside analog. Both
overnight and 4-hour pretreatment with high doses (33-100 μM) of T-705 failed to inhibit SARSCoV-2 replication. Overall, our results indicate that therapeutic concentrations of MMPD, but not
T-705, is effective in reducing SARS-COV-2 coronavirus titers.
Discussion
Our results show that MMPD can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication at low concentrations. This is
likely due its inhibition of IMPDH, leading to a depletion of guanosine for use by the viral
polymerase during replication. By contrast, T-705 has been reported to weakly inhibit IMPDH,
instead acting as a nucleotide analogue and interacting more specifically with certain viral
polymerases (7). Further work is needed to characterize the full mechanism behind MMPD
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 as well as its efficacy in animal models of corona virus infections.
In COVID-19 infection it is essential to minimize the spread of the viral infection to the lower
respiratory tract. We chose to test MMPD pretreated uninfected cells in order to see if viral
spread can be limited. This approach potentially allows us to model the use of this drug for
prophylaxis. This is important since a large proportion of exposed patients can experience rapid
expansion of their viral burden while being asymptomatic. A drug that thwarts this viral

expansion will allow the immune system to eliminate the nascent infection. Since MMPD is a
host directed therapy and not a direct acting antiviral, the likelihood of emergence of resistant
variants of the virus to MMPD is low. Potentially MMPD might be used in combination with
direct antivirals or immunomodulators.
The concentrations tested in this study are easily clinically-achievable in human patients. 50 mg
MMPD administered orally results in plasma concentrations of around 1154 ng/ml (2500 μM)
shortly after administration (8). MMPD may therefore be a viable treatment option for COVID-19
that can be quickly tested and deployed.
