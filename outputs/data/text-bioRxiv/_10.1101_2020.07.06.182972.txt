ABSTRACT

13

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global

14

pandemic. In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated

15

with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and

16

mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19

17

associated coagulopathies are unknown. While there are many theories for the cause of this

18

pathology, including hyper inflammation and excess tissue damage, the cellular and molecular

19

underpinnings are not yet clear. By analyzing transcriptomic data sets from experimental and

20

clinical research teams, we determined that changes in the gene expression of genes important in

21

the extrinsic coagulation cascade in the lung epithelium may be important triggers for COVID-

22

19 coagulopathy. This regulation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is not seen with

23

influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs suggesting that the lung epithelial derived

24

coagulopathies are specific to SARS-Cov-2 infection. This study is the first to identify potential

25

lung epithelial cell derived factors contributing to COVID-19 associated coagulopathy.

AUTHOR SUMMARY
Why was this study done?
• Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly become a global
pandemic.
• In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19 (the disease associated with SARSCoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in
many patients.
• Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are
unknown. Understanding the molecular basis of dysregulated blood coagulation during SARSCoV-2 infection may help promote new therapeutic strategies to mitigate these complications in
COVID-19 patients.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We analyzed three publicly available RNA sequencing datasets to identify possible molecular
etiologies of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies. These data sets include sequencing libraries
from clinically isolated samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and healthy controls. We also
analyzed a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset derived from in vitro SARS-CoV-2
infected primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and mock infected samples.
• Pathway analysis of both NHBE and BALF differential gene expression gene sets. We found that
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and
suppression of the plasminogen activation system in both NHBEs and cells isolated from the
BALF. PBMCs did not differentially express genes regulating blood coagulation.
• Comparison with influenza A virus (IAV)-infected NHBEs revealed that the regulation of the
extrinsic blood coagulation cascade is unique to SARS-CoV-2, and not seen with IAV infection.
What do these findings mean?
• The hyper-activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the
plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells may drive diverse
coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems.
• The gene transcription pattern in SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells is distinct from IAV
infected epithelial cells with regards to the regulation of blood coagulation.

INTRODUCTION:

65
66

In December of 2019, a novel respiratory coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, emerged in

67

Wuhan China.1 It has since spread globally causing major societal shutdowns and >10 million

68

confirmed infections with >500,000 recorded deaths.2,3 Initial clinical reports described the

69

symptomology of COVID-19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2) as a pneumonia presenting

70

with fever, fatigue, shortness of breath, and a dry cough.4 Severe cases are often complicated by

71

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm associated hyper-inflammation,

72

with many patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission due to hypoxia and

73

pneumonia.4,5 The pathology of COVID-19 also impacts organ systems and tissues beyond the

74

lung, including the kidneys, gut, liver, and brain.6–9 Many of the most concerning distal

75

pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been associated with increased blood

76

coagulation and clotting. These diverse coagulopathies have included venous, arterial, and

77

microvascular thromboses of idiopathic origin.8,10–14

78
79

Blood coagulation is primarily regulated by three highly interconnected molecular signaling

80

pathways, platelet activation, the coagulation cascade, and fibrinolysis.15,16 Many excellent

81

review articles on the molecular players in this process are available. 17–25 The extrinsic blood

82

coagulation pathway is effected through a cascading activation of zymogen coagulation factors,

83

which is balanced by endogenously encoded zymogen inhibitors. The end result of the extrinsic

84

coagulation cascade is the formation of crosslinked fibrin clots mediated by activated thrombin.

85

Plasmin suppresses blood coagulation and clotting via proteolytic degradation of these cross

86

linked fibrin blood clots. Increases in pro-coagulant biomarkers are known to be associated with

87

greater risk of mortality for patients suffering acute lung injury (ALI).26–28 Modulation of blood

88

coagulation and fibrinolysis have previously been proposed as therapeutic strategies for the

89

treatment of ALI.29 Many research teams and medical associations have recommended elevated

90

D-dimer and other serum markers of coagulation be measured as biomarkers of COVID-19

91

disease severity for in-patient testing. Blood thinning treatments such as heparin have begun to

92

be administered prophylactically to minimize the risk of COVID-19 associated coagulopathies,

93

and clinical trials are ongoing to investigate the efficacy of common blood thinning medications

94

and anti-coagulants at mitigating COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.30–33 (ClinicalTrials.gov

95

Identifiers: NCT04333407 & NCT04365309)

96
97

Coagulopathies concomitant to hyper-inflammatory injury such as ARDS and sepsis have been

98

hypothesized to synergize due to interactions of inflammation and the extrinsic coagulation

99

cascade.34,35 It has been broadly theorized that COVID-19 associated coagulopathies are

100

indirectly induced by the acute inflammation and pulmonary tissue damage associated with

101

SARS-CoV-2, but precise mechanisms underlying this severe COVID-19 disease phenotype

102

have remained elusive.36,37 The identification of the tissue or cellular origins of the signal

103

transducing molecules that drive dysregulated blood coagulation will be critical to understanding

104

the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced coagulopathies. To this end, we have performed post-

105

hoc analysis on publicly available transcriptomics datasets of SARS-CoV-2-infected normal

106

human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs), COVID-19 patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

107

(BALF) and COVID-19 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with the goal of

108

generating hypotheses regarding the possible etiology of SARS-CoV-2 induced

109

coagulopathies.38,39 We found that there is a clear transcriptional signature of dysregulated blood

110

coagulation cascade signaling in NHBEs that are infected with SARS-CoV-2. These cells are

111

infected in vitro, so this gene signature is not influenced by interactions with immune cells.

112

However, transcriptional analysis of BALF cells revealed many similarities in the regulation of

113

genes important in the coagulation cascade. In contrast, PBMCs isolated from blood do not show

114

this gene signature, indicating that the coagulopathy defect is derived from lung signals. In

115

addition, comparison with transcriptional data from NHBE cells infected with influenza A virus

116

(IAV) revealed that the dysregulation of genes important in coagulation in lung epithelial cells is

117

not generalizable to all respiratory infections.39 Our study demonstrates that changes to the lung

118

epithelium directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be responsible for the coagulopathy

119

seen in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS:

122
123

Xiong et al. – RNA-seq analysis of BALF and PBMCs from SARS-CoV2 infected patients

124

BALF and PBMC sequencing data were generated through the purification of cells and

125

subsequent RNA-sequencing libraries from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the Zhongnan

126

Hospital of Wuhan University as described in Xiong et al.38 These analyses were performed on

127

samples collected as part of standard treatment and diagnostic regimens. No extra burden was

128

imposed on patients.

129
130

Briefly, PBMC cells were purified from peripheral blood samples obtained from 3 patients and 3

131

healthy donors via Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Purified PBMC in the buffy coat were

132

then transferred to a falcon tube and washed with PBS before RNA purification using Trizol and

133

Trizol LS reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol. BALF cells were isolated from

134

patients by injecting 2% lidocaine solution into the right middle lobe or left lingular segment of

135

the lung for local anesthesia. 100ml of room temperature sterile saline was used to lavage the

136

right middle lobe or left lingular segment of the lung before transfer to sterile containers. Three

137

BALF control samples isolated from healthy volunteers were downloaded from a publicly

138

available NCBI dataset at sample accession SRR10571724, SRR10571730, and SRR10571732.40

139
140

Library preparation for BALF and PBMC samples were performed manually using 1g of total

141

RNA as input. The library prep involved poly-A enrichment using oligo-dt capture probes, heat

142

fragmentation, first and second strand synthesis with adapter ligation, and PCR library

143

amplification. After library size selection, the prepared dsDNA libraries were denatured and

144

circularized to allow for rolling circle amplification to form DNA nano-balls (DNBs). The DNBs

145

were then quantified and sequenced on MGISEQ-200 platforms. PBMC and BALF samples

146

were sequenced on either MGISEQ-2000 or Illumina NovaSeq platforms. Raw sequencing data

147

were submitted to the Chinese Academy of Science’s Genome Sequence Archive (GSA)

148

(COVID+ BALF - GSA Accession CRP001417 ; PBMCs – GSA Accession CRA002390).

Transcriptional analysis pipeline

181

The analysis pipeline described below was used to analyze HBEC, PBMC, and BALF data sets

182

for functional enrichments in differentially expressed genes. Sequencing reads were downloaded

183

from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Sequence Read Archive or the

184

Chinese Genomic Data Sharing Initiative’s Genome Sequence Archive in their raw fastq format.

185

Read adapter and quality trimming was performed using the Trim Galore! package41 and

186

Sequencing quality was assessed using the FASTQC and MULTIQC packages.42,43 All read files

187

were deemed to be of sufficient quality for analysis to proceed. Sequence alignment to the

188

GRCh38 reference transcriptome was performed using the Salmon read alignment software and

189

differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 and the tximport

190

packages.44,45 For all differential expression analyses, the infected group of each cell type was

191

compared to the uninfected group of the same cell type.

192
193

PantherDB was used to perform functional enrichment analysis using the Biological Processes

194

Gene Ontology annotation set, with a user supplied gene list of all differentially expressed genes

195

with an adjusted P value of less than then 0.2.46,47 The adjusted P value cut-off of .2 was selected

196

to include genes that may exhibit biologically significant changes in gene expression in the Gene

197

Ontology analysis. Individual gene plots and heat maps were generated in R using the pheatmap

198

or ggplot2 R packages to directly evaluate each gene’s differential expression.48,49

Coagulation pathway gene expression in human bronchial epithelial cells is impacted by

202

infection with SARS-CoV-2

203

In order to determine the impact that SARS-CoV-2 infection has on key factors in the

204

coagulation cascade we examined the transcription of genes that are important in the regulation

205

of hemostasis and venous thrombosis, including the extrinsic coagulation pathway and the

plasminogen activation system. Supplemental Table 1 lists the functions of all the genes within

the blood coagulation cascade that are differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBEs

208

relative to mock-infected controls. These genes are part of the regulation of blood coagulation

210

PantherDB functional enrichment analysis of all NHBE differentially expressed genes (P.adj >

212

maps for the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and plasminogen activation pathway (Figure 1B

213

and Supplemental Table 1), illustrate how infected respiratory epithelial cells may drive this

214

coagulopathy in COVID-19 infection. Most notably, tissue factor is significantly

215

transcriptionally upregulated while balancing inhibitory proteins are either unmodified or

216

significantly downregulated by epithelial cells during infection. Additionally, while plasminogen

217

activating proteins are significantly upregulated, plasminogen activating inhibitors and localizing

218

receptors are also transcriptionally increased. The combination of these transcriptional

219

modifications during SARS-CoV-2 infection may significantly contribute to coagulopathies

220

associated with COVID-19.

Regulation of tissue factor in NHBEs infected with SARS-CoV-2

Figure 2: Violin plots depicting raw counts of reads mapping to key regulators of the extrinsic blood
coagulation cascade in mock infected and SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells. Raw counts were normalized to
library size in the DESeq2 software package. Adjusted P values for all differentially expressed genes were also
calculated within DESeq2. Genes lacking P values are not differentially expressed. Images were generated using
GGPlot2 in the R studio environment.

223

One clear factor that could be impacting the coagulation cascade is the increased

224

expression of F3 in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBEs (Figure 2A). The F3 gene encodes the Tissue

225

Factor protein, which is secreted by a variety of tissue cells to initiate the extrinsic coagulation

226

cascade. This signaling cascade is carefully regulated by the balance of tissue factor protein with

227

several endogenously encoded inhibitor proteins that suppress the signaling cascade. The first

228

inhibitory protein in this cascade is the TFPI gene, which encodes the Tissue Factor Pathway

Inhibitor (TFPI) protein. TFPI acts to suppress blood coagulation by inhibiting the activation of

230

factor VII at the head of the signaling cascade. TFPI transcription is not significantly different in

231

COVID infected epithelial cells relative to mock infected cells (Figure 2B). The maintenance of

232

homeostasis between tissue factor and TFPI is essential for the maintenance of vascular systems

233

without excessive clotting, and the observed increase of tissue factor without corollary increases

234

of TFPI could significantly contribute to the induction of clotting in COVID-19 patients.50

236
237

Decreased expression of PROS1 in NHBEs infected with SARS-CoV-2
Another critical suppressor of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade, the PROS1 gene

238

which encodes Protein S, was also found to be downregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBEs

239

(Figure 2C). Protein S is a vitamin K dependent glycoprotein with homology to Factors VII, IX,

240

and X in the coagulation cascade. Its primary function is to antagonize the coagulation cascade

241

by complexing with Protein C. The complex, known as Activated Protein C, acts to inhibit the

242

maturation of pro-coagulation factors Va and VIIIa. This results in the suppression of both pro-

243

thrombin maturation and thrombin activity. However, the activity of both protein C and protein S

244

is required for this effect.18 It also is known to promote the activity of TFPI.23 Interestingly, the

245

binding of protein S also contributes to efferocytic clearance of apoptotic cells by mediating

246

membrane dynamics between macrophages and epithelial cells. Its activity is highly anti-

247

inflammatory in this capacity, and decreased expression of PROS expression may further

248

exacerbate COVID-19 related pathology through diverse mechanisms.51

251

NHBE cell regulation of plasminogen by SARS-CoV-2 infection
Additionally, within the Regulation of Blood Coagulation GO Term, several genes

252

regulating the activity of plasminogen were identified. Both PLAU (encoding Urokinase) and

253

PLAT (encoding the tissue plasminogen activator protein) are observed to be significantly

254

increased in SARS-CoV-2 NHBEs (Figures 3A and 3B). NHBEs infected with SARS-CoV-2

255

significantly upregulate expression of SERPINB2, which encodes the protein Plasminogen

256

Activator Inhibitor 2 (PAI-2) (Figure 3C). PAI-2, is known to be a potent inhibitor of both

257

Urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, acting through the proteolytic inactivation of

258

plasminogen activators. (DOI: 10.1007/s00018-004-4230-9) While PAI-2 is most commonly

259

localized within the cytoplasm, the increased release of markers of membrane permeable cell

260

death such as lactate dehydrogenase may provide evidence for the increased secretion of other

261

cytoplasmic proteins such as PAI-2. (doi:10.1001/jama.2020.1585) The expression of PLAUR, a

262

receptor localizing activated urokinase to the cell membrane, is also significantly increased in

263

SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBEs (Figure 3D). The localized activity of PAI-2 may significantly

264

inhibit the effect of PLAU/PLAUR in complex and thereby contribute to the formation of

265

pulmonary embolisms and distal coagulopathies.

Plotting of the subset of genes in the Regulation of Blood Coagulation (GO:0030193) GO

269

term that were initially found to differentially expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBEs ,

270

revealed a clear pattern of transcriptional regulation in cells isolated via BALF of COVID-19

271

patients as well (Figure 4A). In addition, plotting of the expression data of all BALF

272

differentially expressed genes (P.adj > .2) in the Regulation of Blood Coagulation GO term

273

revealed clear regulation of the blood coagulation cascade occurring locally within the

274

bronchoalveolar space (Figure 4B). Many of these expression signatures recapitulate the findings

275

we observed when analyzing in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cells.

276

These include the upregulation of pro-coagulation genes such as F3 (tissue factor) and

277

SERPINB2, along with the downregulation of inhibitory genes such as PROS1 and PLAUR, and

278

PLAT. Additionally, the gene PROCR, a receptor that augments the inhibitory activity of protein

279

S and protein C, was found to be suppressed in the BALF during infection. Unlike the NHBE

280

data set there is increased expression of TFPI and PLAT in the BALF from SARS-CoV-2,

281

indicating that hosts are actively signaling to suppress coagulation during COVID-19. However,

282

the increasing appearance of coagulopathies in COVID-19 patients indicate that this signaling is

283

often insufficient to prevent morbidity and mortality.

284

In analyzing these data, is important to note that BALF samples contain a complex

285

mixture of resident and recruited immune cells, along with damaged tissue cells that have been

286

freed from the membrane, often concomitantly with cell death processes. Prior research indicates

287

that during SARS-CoV-1 infection, there is significant epithelial denudation which may result in

288

a greater fraction of cells in BALF samples from infected individuals containing epithelial cells

289

and type 2 pneumocytes.52,53 As such, the transcriptional signature in analyzed BALF samples

290

represents a bulk averaging of this complex mixture. Additionally, given the impact of varying

non-related pre-existing conditions) further analysis of additional BALF patient samples is

required to confirm these observations.

Analysis of coagulation pathway gene expression in PBMCs

296

In order to determine if coagulation pathway gene expression was changed in circulating

297

immune cells we analyzed sequencing datasets generated from COVID-19 patient purified

PBMCs as described in Xiong et al. PantherDB Functional enrichment analysis found no

303

immune cells. From these data, we concluded it is unlikely that circulating immune cells during

304

SARS-CoV-2 infection are inducing blood coagulation through the secretion of signals

305

activating the extrinsic or intrinsic blood coagulation cascade in response to systemic

306

inflammation.

In order to determine if these transcriptional changes are specific for SARS-CoV-2 or are more

IAV infected NHBE cells. PantherDB Functional enrichment analysis found no significant

313

enrichment of genes regulating or effecting blood coagulation in these sequencing datasets when

314

comparing IAV infected and uninfected NHBEs (Full functional enrichment results in

315

supplement). Furthermore, heatmap plotting of genes found to be differentially expressed in

316

NHBE cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1A), did not reveal any notable patterns or

317

differential expression signatures in the context of IAV infection (Figure 6). These findings are

318

consistent with the lack of severe coagulopathies associated with IAV infection in the clinic and

319

further support the notion that the induction of coagulopathies during SARS-CoV-2 infection is

320

independent of systemic inflammation common to both infections. This indicates that COVID-19

321

associated coagulopathies may be triggered by changes in lung epithelial cell transcription

322

patterns uniquely induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

323
324

DISCUSSION:

325
326

The data presented here demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial epithelial

327

cells may drive three key molecular responses promoting coagulopathies associated with

328

COVID-19; (1) induction of the extrinsic coagulation cascade through the activation of tissue

329

factor signaling without compensatory tissue factor pathway inhibitor expression; (2) the

330

suppression of anticoagulation signaling through the down regulation of Protein S in the

331

pulmonary space; and (3) the upregulation of plasminogen inactivation proteins and localization

332

factors. Such activities by infected pulmonary epithelial cells in vivo could significantly

333

predispose patients to the hyper-coagulation that has been associated with SARS-CoV-2. In

334

addition, our data indicate that the same genes are not upregulated by human bronchial epithelial

335

cells infected with IAV, indicating that the severity of coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients may

336

be derived from changes in infected lung epithelial cells.

337
338

There is mounting evidence that coagulation defects are a significant and severe pathology of

339

COVID-19. An early clinical correspondence published in the New England Journal of Medicine

340

reported that 5 New York City patients under the age of 50 presented with large vessel arterial

341

stroke from March 23 to April 7, 2020.10 Since then, reports of COVID-19 associated

342

coagulopathies in the young and old have proliferated globally, with reports describing acute

343

pulmonary embolism in the microvasculature of the lung, as well as cerebral, renal, and bowel

344

localized embolic disease.8,11,12 Reports have shown that acute pulmonary thromboembolism

345

presents in 30% of severe clinical COVID-19 patients by pulmonary CT angiography. These

346

emboli were found to be associated with elevation of serum D-dimer, which is produced during

347

the degradation of crosslinked fibrin clots by enzymes such as plasmin.13 Some preliminary

348

reports have also found that biomarkers of coagulation such as clot strength, platelet and

349

fibrinogen contributions to clots, and elevated d-dimer levels are significantly increased with

350

ARDS caused by COVID-19.14 A diverse spectrum of proinflammatory mediators shown to be

351

dramatically upregulated in COVID-19 and other coronavirus pathologies are also known to

352

contribute to tissue factor induced hypercoagulability.54 Many other molecular factors increased

353

with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including phosphatidylserine exposure, interferon expression,

354

ICAM expression, angiotensin II expression, and complement activation, are also known to

355

“decrypt” tissue factor from its inactive form on the surface of tissue cells.18 Such “coagulation-

356

inflammation-thrombosis” circuit feedback loops coupled with the multiple zymogen activation

357

mediated feedback loops within the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade, could significantly

358

contribute to the induction of COVID-19 coagulopathy in patients.18 However, further

359

investigation of the activation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade or the inhibition of

360

plasmin by respiratory epithelial cells is required to validate these hypotheses.

361
362

To best treat patients it is necessary to understand the tissue, cellular, and molecular

363

underpinnings of COVID-19 pathology. In order to investigate the role that systemic and lung

364

cells play in coagulopathy we analyzed three distinct data sets. The first dataset, published in

365

Xiong et al. performed transcriptome sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells

366

(PBMCs) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells isolated from human patients infected

367

with SARS-CoV-2.38 The second data set, published in Blanco-Melo et al. performed

368

transcriptome sequencing on commercially purchased normal human bronchial epithelial cells

369

isolated from a 78 year old woman infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV.39

370
371

Coagulation cascade induction is thought to be necessary during ARDS or ALI, and may

372

be protective.55 However, when it becomes dysregulated it can be damaging. Also, systemic

373

coagulation defects can cause severe pathologies. For instance, tissue factor and other genes

374

within the extrinsic coagulation cascade and fibrinolysis pathway were previously found to

375

contribute to ALI in a murine model of coronavirus infection.59 ARDS is often associated with

376

increased biomarkers of coagulation and fibrinolysis. For instance, increases in pro-coagulant

377

biomarkers are known to be associated with greater risk of mortality for patients suffering acute

378

lung injury. Pulmonary edema fluids and plasma from patients with acute lung injury have also

379

been shown to contain lesser amounts of anti-coagulant protein C and higher amounts of

380

plasminogen activator inhibitors, likely secreted from epithelial and endothelial pulmonary

381

cells.26–28 However, our comparison of gene signatures from IAV infected NHBEs with those

382

from SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBEs indicate that SARS-CoV-2 may be unique from other

383

respiratory viruses in terms of the risk of coagulation defects. Changes to the lung epithelium,

384

separate from inflammatory immune responses, may increase the risk of coagulopathies.

385
386

The role of the lung epithelium in coagulation defects has not been fully explored, however

387

several lines of evidence demonstrate that it may play a key role in some instances. Lung

388

epithelial cell lines have been shown to have increased expression of TF after incubation with

389

pulmonary edema fluid from ARDS patients.56 In addition, mouse models demonstrate that lung

390

epithelial-derived TF may play an important role in tissue protection during ALI caused by

391

LPS.57 In vitro experiments with human epithelial cells indicate that TF may also be important

392

for lung epithelial basal cell survival.58 Taken together these lines of evidence suggest that while

393

induction of the extrinsic coagulation cascade by lung epithelial cells may be an important host

394

response during some stages of infection, but SARS-CoV-2 can cause such profound changes

395

that this leads to hyper-coagulation and systemic pathologies.

396
397

Other important players in regulation of the coagulation cascade are vascular endothelial

398

cells. Endothelial cells are known to release soluble tissue factor in response to cytokines, which

399

may further contribute to extrinsic coagulation cascade induced coagulopathies in COVID-19

400

patients.59 The possibility of direct endothelial cell infection by SARS-CoV-2, which has been

401

shown to occur in vitro and may occur in vivo, should also be considered as a possible

402

mechanism for the induction of hyper-coagulation signals driving COVID-19 associated

403

coagulopathies.60 Indirect damage of endothelial cells during acute lung injury associated with

404

ARDS could also drive these signals. However, to our knowledge, there are currently no RNA-

405

sequencing datasets with infected endothelial cell cultures or tissue available. Such data sets

406

would be invaluable in determining how endothelial cells respond to epithelial cell coagulation

407

signals or how endothelial cells directly modulate hyper-coagulation associated with SARS-

408

CoV-2 infection.

409
410

Many researchers have proposed that lytic regulated cell death by respiratory epithelial

411

cells, particularly pyroptosis, may play a significant role in COVID-19 pathogenesis.61 During

412

lytic cell death many intracellular pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage

413

associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) typically isolated within cell membranes are released.

414

However, it is also underappreciated that diverse intracellular and membrane bound contents are

415

also released in addition to PAMPs and DAMPs. It is possible that proteins such as tissue factor,

416

plasminogen activating inhibitors, and pro-coagulant factors may be released into the pulmonary

417

space during COVID-19 induced lytic cell death of epithelial cells. If this is the case, such

418

factors may drive paracrine signaling to nearby endothelial cells. This could further exacerbate

419

coagulation systemically by inducing the secretion of activated coagulation cascade zymogens

420

and thrombin into the blood. Such factors could also enter the blood stream directly near

421

damaged endothelial tissues in the lung. Epithelial cell derived hyper-coagulation factors and

422

plasminogen inhibitors also may drive local pulmonary hyper-coagulation and further exacerbate

423

tissue destruction in the lung during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

424
425
426

Further investigation of pulmonary endothelial, epithelial, and immune cell responses to
SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for unraveling the mystery of COVID-19 induced hyper-

427

coagulation. The current BALF data is from bulk sequencing, which can obscure cell-type

428

specific gene signatures. In addition, further characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infected human

429

respiratory epithelial cells in physiologically relevant in vitro systems, such as air liquid interface

430

cultures, would increase our understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the lung

431

epithelium. Culture of vascular endothelial cells could be used to determine the role that either

432

direct infection of endothelial cells or exposure to inflammatory cues may play in causing

433

coagulopathies. Such approaches would facilitate sequencing, imaging, or proteomic

434

investigations of the activity of tissue factor, plasminogen activation inhibitor 2, and

435

plasminogen activators in infected lung cells.

436
437

While further investigation is required to determine if epithelial cell signaling are driving

438

coagulopathy, several possible clinical appoaches could be considered after further validation.

439

For instance, serum samples from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with severe COVID-19

440

symptoms or coagulopathies could be assayed to determine the concentration and activation state

441

of zymogens effecting the extrinsic coagulation cascade.62 These approaches could similarly be

442

utilized to design blood panels for stratifying COVID-19 in-patient coagulopathy risk or

443

monitoring of embolic disease risk. Identifying the molecular and cellular factors that drive

444

SARS-CoV-2 induced coagulopathy is essential, both from the perspective of understanding the

445

biology behind SARS-CoV-2 and in terms of clinical treatments. The data in this study

446

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 has a unique impact on pulmonary cells. Furthering our

447

understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathology, and the central role that the lung epithelium may play

448

on this pathology will be essential in determining the ideal treatment regimens for COVID-19.
