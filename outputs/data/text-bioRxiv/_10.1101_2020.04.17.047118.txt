ABSTRACT
We aim to test four one-step RT real-time mastermix options for use in SARS-CoV2 real-time PCR,
with three primer/probe assays targeting the N gene. The lower limit of detection is determined
using a SARS CoV2 N gene RNA transcript dilution series (to 1 copy/µl) and verified using 74 nose and
throat swabs.
The N2 assay demonstrates the most sensitive detection of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Three of the four
mastermixes performed well , with the Takara One Step PrimeScript™ III RT-PCR Kit mastermix
demonstrating improved performance at the lower limit of detection.

INTRODUCTION
The 2019/2020 pandemic of SARS-CoV2 infection, with more than 2 million confirmed cases
reported globally to date (Dong et al. 2020), has resulted in the need for the rapid implementation
of diagnostic testing centred around detection of SARS-CoV2 RNA using real-time RT PCR. The urgent
need for a rapid increase in testing capacity has resulted in shortages of critical reagents, including
PCR mastermixes.
This study aims to test multiple commercially available one-step RT real-time mastermix options for
use in SARS-CoV2 real-time PCR testing.

N gene transcript
An RNA transcript of the SARS-CoV2 nucleocapsid (N) gene was constructed (see supplementary
methods) and quantified using the Qubit Fluorometer [Thermo Fisher].
A 10-fold dilution series of SARS-CoV2 N gene transcript was prepared from 1– 100,000 copies/µl.
Nose and throat swabs
Total nucleic acid was purified from 74 nose and/or throat swabs from suspected cases of SARSCoV2 infection. Briefly, dry flocked swabs were re-suspended with 600 or 1,200 µl nuclease-free
water (for single or double swabs, respectively). Total nucleic acid was purified from 200 µl swab
suspension fluid using the Hamilton Nimbus (with Kingfisher Presto) and Omega Biotek Mag-Bind
Viral DNA/RNA kit with 100 µl elution volume. Each specimen was spiked with Phocine Distemper
Virus (PDV) cell culture isolate (cultured in vero cells) during the nucleic acid extraction as an internal
positive control.
In silico evaluation of primer/probe design
For the in silico evaluation of primer and probe coverage, 3,820 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
were retrieved from database Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (Shu and
McCauley, 2017) (https://www.gisaid.org/) (accessed 03.04.2020). In addition, 60 taxonomically
closely related human SARS-CoV genome sequences were obtained from NCBI data, using SARS-CoV
reference sequence (GenBank accession number NC_004718.3). Reduced length (<27,000 bp) and
low quality sequences (≥10% unknown bases (Ns) were removed. Upon quality filtering, 3,266 SARSCoV-2 and 61 SARS-CoV sequences were aligned using ClustalW programme in MEGA X (Kumar et
al., 2018). Primer and probe coverages were calculated from the aligned sequence data, considering
no mismatches.
PCR testing
The N gene transcript dilution series, from 1– 100,000 copies/µl, was tested in duplicate using the
four commercially available mastermixes in Table 1 and the three primer and probe sets in Table 2.
The nucleic acid purified from swabs were tested using the Takara and Qiagen mastermixes with the
N geneTaq-PDV PCR assay as per Table 1 and Table 2. A negative extraction control was extracted
and PCR tested alongside the swabs,
All PCR reactions were performed in 25 µl reaction volumes with 7.5 µl of RNA per reaction and run
on a Quant5 thermocycler [Thermo Fisher] with manufacturer recommended fast cycling conditions
and 45 cycles (Table 3).

RESULTS
N gene transcript dilution series
The cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained for each of the N gene transcript dilution series with each
mastermix and primer and probe assay is shown in Table 4.
Nose and throat swabs
Of the 74 swabs tested using the Takara and Qiagen mastermixes, 67/74 had concordant SARS-CoV2
PCR results (Table 5). Of the discordant results, 7/74 swabs were PCR positive with the Takara
mastermix but negative with the Qiagen mastermix, with a median Ct value of 40.9 (range 38.5–
41.9). There were no specimens (0/74) positive with the Qiagen PCR but negative with Takara
mastermix. All SARS-CoV2 PCR negative specimens (38/74) had detectable PDV within the expected
Ct value range (data not shown). Moreover, the background fluorescence of the amplification plot
was considerably lower with Takara mastermix compared to Qiagen Mastermix (Figure 1)
In silico evaluation of primer/probe design
All three primer/probe sets tested in this study (N geneTaq, N1 and N2) are identical to >99% of
SARS-CoV2 sequences available up to 3rd April 2020 (see Supplementary Results). N geneTaq primers
(Grant et al. 2020) were also identical to SARS-CoV sequences, with mismatches in 4/22 positions in
the probe. The N1 primers and probe had mismatches to SARS-CoV in 2–7 positions in each primer
and probe. The N2 forward primer is identical to SARS-CoV, with mismatches in 2–5 positions in each
the reverse primer and probe.
CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrate that, of the RT-PCR assays targeting SARS-CoV2 N gene RNA tested in this study,
the N2 primers and probe (CDC 2020) show the lowest limit of detection across all four of the
mastermixes tested (<1 copy/µl with Takara, Qiagen and TaqPath; 1–10 copies/µl with Fast Virus).
Our data shows that the Takara One Step PrimeScript™ III RT-PCR Kit mastermix has improved
performance at the lower limit of detection compared to the other mastermixes tested in this study,
evidenced by a lower limit of detection of the N gene RNA transcript across all N gene targets (LLOD
<1–10 copies/µl) and the additional detection of 7/74 swabs with our in-house N geneTaq-PDV
assay. Taqman Fast Virus 1-step mastermix is the most poorly performing of the mastermixes tested,
with a LLOD of 1–100 copies/µl across N gene targets tested.
All three primer/probe sets (N geneTaq, N1 and N2) have good homology to sequenced strains of
SARS-CoV2 so are likely to detect circulating virus. Based on homology to SARS-CoV sequences, N

geneTaq primers and probe (Grant et al. 2020) are the most likely to show some cross-reactivity with
SARS-CoV virus but requires in vitro testing to verify, as the mismatches in the probe may be
sufficient to prevent cross-amplification. Possible cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV is not of clinical
concern at this time. No cross-reactivity is anticipated with other circulating human
betacoronaviruses.
Based on the data generated in this study we recommend that for optimum detection of SARS CoV-2
RNA from nose and throat swabs the N2 primers and probe assay is used with any of the following
mastermixes; Takara, Qiagen and TaqPath. Alternatively we recommend the N geneTaq (Grant et al
2020) or the N1 assays are used with Takara mastermix.
The data presented here provides evidence for the recommendation of mastermixes for detection of
SARS-CoV2 RNA targeting the N gene and suggests adequate alternatives in the event of supply
chain issues.

Table 4. PCR results of N gene transcript dilution series, tested in duplicate. Results are expressed as
Ct values. The lower limit of detection (LLOD) is estimated to be the lowest dilution at which both
(2/2) duplicates are detected. Where only one of the dilution duplicates (1/2) is detected, the LLOD
is estimated to be between that and the consistently (2/2) detected dilution. Where the lowest
dilution is consistently (2/2) detected with a Ct value <40, the LLOD is estimated to be less than the
lowest dilution tested.
