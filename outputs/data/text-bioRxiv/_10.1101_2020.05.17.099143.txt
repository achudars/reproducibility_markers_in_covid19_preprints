Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-2) and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is
of public health emergency of international concern. Coronaviruses, including
SARS-CoV-2, encode an envelope (E) protein, which is a small, hydrophobic
membrane protein; the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 has high homology with that of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. (SARS-CoV) In this study, we
provide insights into the function of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel and the ion
and water permeation mechanisms on the basis of combined in silico methods. Our
results suggest that the pentameric E protein promotes the penetration of monovalent
ions through the channel. Analysis of the potential mean force (PMF), pore radius and
diffusion coefficient reveals that Leu10 and Phe19 are the hydrophobic gates of the
channel. In addition, the pore demonstrated a clear wetting/dewetting transition with
monovalent cation selectivity under transmembrane voltage, which indicates that it is
a

hydrophobic

voltage-dependent

channel.

Overall,

these

results

provide

structural-basis insights and molecular-dynamic information that are needed to
understand the regulatory mechanisms of ion permeability in the pentameric
SARS-CoV-2 E protein channel.

Introduction
COVID-19 is a severe and highly contagious respiratory illness that was first reported
in China in early December 2019. Subsequently, the virus has spread worldwide. As
of May 6, 2020, millions of cases have been confirmed, and hundreds of thousands
have died. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global pandemic for
COVID-19 in March 2020. In addition to the hazards of the disease itself, it has also
led to a severe turbulence in international financial markets and may cause serious
consequences such as a financial crisis. COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new
coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. It is speculated that it originated from bats and was
transmitted to humans through an intermediate host (some kind of wildlife). Its

symptoms include fever, general malaise, dry cough, shortness of breath, and
respiratory distress. Comparing similar diseases, including severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which are also
caused by coronaviruses, the mortality rates for SARS and MERS were 10% and 36%,
respectively 1. Currently, COVID-19 has a mortality rate of 1 to 10% in different
countries but appears to be more contagious than SARS and MERS 2 3 4 5.
Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a long positive-sense, long
single-stranded (30 kb) RNA virus. The structure of different human coronaviruses
(HCoVs) is similar. The viral genome is packed by nucleocapsid (N) proteins,
forming a helicoidal nucleocapsid protected by a lipid envelope 6. Several viral
proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins, are
embedded within a lipid envelope

7 8

. Studies have shown that S, M, and N proteins

play important roles in receptor binding and virion budding. For example, the M
protein participates in virus germination and interacts with the N and S proteins. The
S protein has immune recognition sites and can be used to design vaccines 9.
Currently, the importance of the E protein has not been fully revealed. Evidence
suggests that the E protein maintains its morphology after virus assembly by
interacting with the M protein

10 11 12

. When an E protein gene mutation occurs, it

promotes apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that coronaviruses have a viroporin
that can self-assemble into a pentameric structure and have ion selectivity. When there
is a transmembrane voltage, the ion channel characteristics of viroporins are more
significant. In addition, the Asn25Ala and Val18Phe mutations could destroy ion
channel activity

13

. This indicates that the E protein may play an important role in

regulating the ion equilibrium inside and outside the viral envelope.
The ion channel activity of the E protein can lead to increased levels of the
inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF and IL-6 in the lungs, leading to the occurrence
of an "inflammatory storm" 14. This plays a key role in the progression of the disease
and may cause the patient's condition to suddenly deteriorate and lead to death. In
addition, its evolutionary conservatism may be an important cause of viral cross-host
infection 15 16 17.

Although previous studies have suggested that the E protein of coronaviruses such as
SARS and MERS oligomerizes and has ion permeability, the specific mechanism of
ion permeability and channel properties remain to be explored due to the lack of a
crystal structure for the E protein. In 2014, Li et al

17

identified the SARS-CoV E

protein monomer structure. In 2018, Surya et al. extracted the pentamer structure of
the SARS E protein by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 18, which provided strong
support for the study of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer ion permeability
mechanism.
In this study, we obtained the amino acid sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database

19

. The E

protein pentamer model of SARS-CoV-2 was built by using the homology modeling
method, and the reasonableness of the model was evaluated. Subsequently, µs-level
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the pentamer's
stability in the membrane environment. We tried to use potential mean force (PMF) to
reveal the permeability of different physiological ions and water molecules in the
pores of the E protein pentamer. The characteristics of the pentameric channel were
analyzed by combining the channel diffusion coefficient and geometric properties. In
addition, computational electrophysiology was applied for different transmembrane
voltages of the system to reveal the effect of the voltage on the ion permeability of the
pentameric E protein.
Overall, exploring the mechanisms of the pentameric SARS-CoV-2 E protein not only
provides valuable insights into the conduction of the channel but also has important
implications for our understanding of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses.

SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer homology model evaluation
The Rampage online program

20

was used to evaluate the accuracy of the

SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein model. More than 98.9% of the amino acids are
within the acceptable range, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein is similar to
the SARS E protein NMR model. Subsequently, a 1000 ns (1 µs) MD simulation was
performed to evaluate the stability of pentameric E protein embedded in the
membrane environment. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the model is
shown in Figure 2, and the red and blue curves represent the whole protein and TM
region, respectively. In the first 200 ns, the RMSD continued to rise, indicating that
the model needed longer optimization (compared with other ion channels) to reach the
pentameric structure equilibrium. During the last 800 ns, the curves plateaued. The
RMSD of the whole protein and the TM region converged at ~0.4 and ~0.3 nm,
respectively. There is a 0.1 nm difference between the whole protein and TM region.
These findings are consistent with other ion channel data that show that the TM
region has a higher stability than the other parts of the membrane protein 21.

profile. The dashed line is the experimental value of a single K+ diffusion coefficient
in water, DC=10-5 cm2/s. Error bars were estimated by bootstrapping and are the same
color as the corresponding line.

Water and ion permeability
The permeability of the SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein channel is very important
for understanding the replication ability of viruses in cells and how they are secreted
into the extracellular medium 22. It is possible to examine a profile of the free energy
of a single ion or water as a function of its position along the pore axis by calculation
of PMF. In this simulation, the ions or water molecules are restrained to a continuous
position along the z-axis and move freely in the pore’s xy plane. Moreover, other parts
of the system (proteins, ions, water molecules, and lipids) can move freely and reach
equilibrium.
The PMF of important physiological ions (Mg2+; Ca2+; Cl-; K+ and Na+) and the
water molecules as a function of their position along the pore (z)-axis were calculated
separately. Figure 3A shows the PMF of ions and water molecules permeating through
the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer pore. ZM is defined as the axial direction along
the pore, which is from -3 ~ 3 nm (the length of umbrella sampling is 6 nm in total).

From the PMF curve, we found that the energy barriers of monovalent and divalent
ions have a significant difference. The maximum energy barriers of the two divalent
ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ are 60 kJ/mol and 70 kJ/mol, respectively. In contrast, the PMFs
of the monovalent ions Na+ and K+ are ~ 12 kJ/mol and ~20 kJ/mol, respectively,
while the Cl- energy barrier is ~ 30 kJ/mol, which is significantly smaller than that of
Ca2+ and Mg2+. From an energy perspective, the SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein is
almost impermeable to divalent ions. This confirms the previous hypothesis that the
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV E protein channel is a monovalent cation channel

23 24

.

The maximum energy barrier in descending order is as follows: Na+ <K+ <Cl- <Mg2+
<Ca2+. Additionally, the barrier of water molecules is only ~ 5 k/mol, which is similar
to the energy threshold of free diffusion in liquid. Interestingly, there is no obvious
peak in the PMF curve for Na+ ions and water molecules. This result indicates that the
E protein pentamer pores are not permeable to divalent ions. The difference in the
energy barrier between the monovalent cations is large, suggesting that the channel
has selective permeability for specific ions.
To explore the permeability of the channel, we calculated the diffusion coefficient (DC)
using a single K+ ion as a probe. By fitting the K+ mean square displacement (MSD)
with the Einstein equation (MSD = 2D(c)t), we obtained the diffusion coefficient. As
shown in Figure 3B, the average diffusion coefficient of K+ outside the pore is ~
2.0×10-5±0.4 cm2/s, which is consistent with the experimental data of K+ in the liquid
environment 25. However, the DC decreases by approximately 70% when the K+ probe
is in the channel pore. The DC curve of the internal channel pore has a flat bottom and
is similar to the PMF. The mid-value of DC = 0.35×10 -5±0.2 cm2/s indicates that there
is a large obstacle for probe diffusion in the inner pore, showing a similar value to
other narrow hydrophobic pores 26 27.
Next, we used the solubility-diffusion equation (Eq 1)

In Eq 1, PMF(z) and D(z) are functions of PMF and DC along the z-axis, z1 denotes a
position on one side of the pore and z2 denotes a position on the other side. Kb is the
Boltzmann constant, and T is the simulation temperature. The part of the PMF in the
TM region is approximate to the graph of the quadratic function, so the PMF(Z) uses
quadratic function fitting. The linear fitting of the corresponding DC gives the

region were simply evaluated. PNa+/PK+ = 22.42, PK+/PCl- = 5.82, and PH2O/PNa+ =

Computational electrophysiology
Previous electrochemical experiments have shown that the transmembrane voltage
has an important effect on the pore permeability for the E protein in both SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV 23 24. In addition, viroporins and similarly nanopores are sensitive to
transmembrane voltage, causing electrowetting of the pores and changing the tension
on the hydrophobic surface inside the pores, which is enough to functionally open the
channels

30 31 32 33

. We used the computational electrophysiology first proposed by

Kutzner et al. This approach expands the membrane protein structure into a
"sandwich" and simulates the transmembrane voltage by adjusting the number of ions
at different layers. It can directly simulate and analyze the ion penetration in the
presence of transmembrane voltage at an atomic resolution. The sandwich structure of
the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer is presented in Figure 4A. A total of 4 models
were established to simulate the charge differences between the two sides of the
channel (ΔQ = 12e, 8e, 4e, and 0e). Using the method described above, the
transmembrane voltage was calculated as ΔU = ~ 0.45 V, 0.3 V, 0.15 V, and 0 V,
respectively (Fig 4B).

the water counts in the TM region for 20 ns simulations. The different colors represent
different models: 0e (blue), 4e (red), 8e (blue) and 12e (magenta).

Effect of transmembrane voltage
Trick et al. indicated that the behavior of water molecules in pores can be used as a
reasonable method to study the ion permeability of channels

27

. Many works have

shown that water influx into hydrophobic pores may help ions overcome the energy
barrier on hydrophobic surfaces 34 35. Overall, we could speculate the ion penetrability
of the E protein pentamer by the statistical number of water molecular counts in the
inner pore.
To accurately assess the behavior of water molecules in the SARS-CoV-2 E protein
pentamer pores, we performed six 20 ns simulations for each transmembrane voltage,
and the total simulation time reached ~0.5 µs. Subsequently, the water molecules at
different transmembrane voltages were counted (the statistical data of the changes in
the molecule counts are shown in the Supplementary Word Film). We extracted
representative water molecule diagrams for each voltage, as shown in Figure 5A.
When ΔQ = 0e, the average time for the channel to keep wetting is ~ 3 ns. ΔQ = 4e is
slightly longer (~ 5 ns). The absolute number of water molecules in the pore is small,
with the average ranging from 0 to 5 (Fig 5B). Although the pores are functionally
open for water permeation, due to the small stream of water, they may not be able to
maintain sufficient electrical wetting, resulting in ions that cannot permeate
unimpeded. We speculate that at the maximum physiological voltage (~0.2 V), the
SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein pore can only permeate a few water molecules.
The number of water molecules increased significantly when ΔQ = 8e or 12e (ΔU = ~
0.3 V, 0.45 V), and the water distributions were 4-20 (8e) and 15-27 (12e) (The
process of water permeation see supplementary Movie 1). The pores remained in a
wetting state. The experiment shows that the maximum ΔU = 0.45 V is not enough to
cause electrical breakdown of the lipid bilayer

36

, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 E

protein channel is activated by transmembrane voltage. Additionally, we observed that
a few water molecules were able to be cotransported with Na+ and K+ during the

simulations (See Supplementary Movie 2 and 3). Interestingly, as the voltage
increased, the permeability of water molecules also increased synchronously, showing
a periodic change regardless of the magnitude of the transmembrane voltage (even if
ΔU = 0). The calculation suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer channel
has obvious wetting/dewetting transitions and that it has the typical characteristics of
voltage-dependent hydrophobic channels.

Pore conformation analysis
By calculating the channel radius at different voltages (ΔU = ~ 0.45 V, 0.3 V, 0.15 V, 0

V and 0 V (closed state)) (Fig 6B), we found that in the pentameric E protein channel
in the closed state (ΔU = 0 V), there are two positions with the minimum radius in the
TM region, r = 0.2 nm (ZM = -0.8 nm) and 0.15 nm (ZM = -0.5 nm), corresponding to
Leu10 and Phe19 (blue and red arrows, respectively). Phe19 and Leu10 are located at
the top and bottom of the pore, respectively. The two positions show a candidate gated
area of the channel. Figure 6A shows that these two locations have obvious
"bottlenecks", which are not large enough for water permeation. This was also
confirmed by the calculation of the channel radius on different transmembrane
voltages. The radius of the pore obviously increased with transmembrane voltage at
the two locations. In the open state (ΔU=0 V), the pore radius increased to 2 nm and
2.2 nm. When the transmembrane voltage increased to ΔU = ~ 0.15 V and 0.3 V, the
radius of the pore at the Leu10 position was ~ 0.23 nm and 0.28 nm, and the radius of
the pore at Phe19 was ~0.25 nm and 0.33 nm, respectively. The voltage had a greater
influence on Phe19 than on Leu10. However, for ΔU = 0.45 V, the radius of the pore
was still ~ 0.33 nm at Phe19 but had expanded to 0.4 nm at Leu10, indicating that the
large transmembrane voltage may make Leu10 excessively available, which may
cause the unidirectional permeation to be destroyed. The narrowest locations of the
inner pore are consistent with the energy barrier. Apparently, the radius of the inner
pore showed that Leu10 and Phe19 of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein are candidate
hydrophobic gates.

Discussion
COVID-19 is an unprecedented threat to humanity. To understand the infection, the
replication mechanism of the virus in the human body is particularly important.
Currently, research on the pathogenic mechanism and infection route of COVID-19
mainly focuses on the S protein 38 39, but research on the E protein is lacking. Previous
reports note that the E protein pentamers from different coronavirus subtypes
(SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) may be viroporins, which play an important role in the
virus life cycle 40. Deleting the encoding gene of the E protein will greatly reduce the

replication and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Moreover, the pentameric E protein
channel activity is necessary for inflammasome activation and is the determinant of
coronavirus virulence

41

. This study explored the permeability mechanism of the

SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein. We used the NMR conformation of the
SARS-CoV E protein pentamer to build the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer model
by homology modeling. A combination of MD simulations, PMF, diffusion coefficient
calculations, computational electrophysiology analyses, and channel pore geometry
analyses was used. The results were mutually corroborated and characterized the TM
dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein channel. It was found that the
pentamer is a monovalent cation-selective voltage-dependent hydrophobic channel,
and the two amino acids Leu10 and Phe19 are candidate hydrophobic gates.
The SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer has been considered an unknown nature ion
channel. There is significant similarity in the TM region sequences (reaching 91.8%)
and high gene homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 E proteins; five
different residues are all located at the region of interaction between the protein and
membrane, while the sequences of the TM region are completely identical. The highly
conserved TM region also suggests similar E protein functions in different
coronavirus subtypes. As the RMSD of the E protein pentamer during the 1 µs MD
simulation, the structure has a certain flexibility, showing that its geometric
deformation can make the channel permeable to ions and water molecules. Figure 2
shows that the TM region of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein remains relatively stable
during the simulation, indicating the stability of the pentamer in the membrane
environment, which is consistent with previous studies of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV.
The free energy calculation of the ions permeating through the SARS-CoV-2
pentameric E protein channel strongly suggests that the pore has selection
permeability for monovalent ions. The maximum energy barriers of Na+, K+, and Clare 15 kJ/mol, 20 kJ/mol, and 30 kJ/mol, respectively. The comparison of the P values
for Na+, K+ and Cl- shows that the P of Na+ is 22 times greater than that of K+, while
the P of K+ is 6 times greater than that of Cl-. Although the computational

permeability coefficient is two times higher or lower than that observed
experimentally for SARS-CoV, it still shows a very large gap in the permeation
between ions and water molecules. Additionally, there is no obvious peak in the PMF
when Na+ and water molecules permeate through the channel, further supporting that
Na+ and water molecules have less penetration resistance at the inner pore. This
further confirmed the selectively for Na+. The ion selectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is
different from that of SARS-CoV

23

. Because the maximum energy barrier of Mg2+

and Ca2+ is 2 ~ 3 times higher than that of the monovalent ions, divalent ions cannot
overcome such a very large energy barrier under the simulation environment. The
conformational analysis indicates that it is mainly caused by the geometric size of the
pore (Fig 6).
The importance of transmembrane voltage on viroporin has been found in many
viruses, including HIV1 Vpu oligomers and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) p7 protein,
etc.

42 43 44

. Although it has been observed in many experiments, this mechanism has

not been revealed. Because water molecules play an important role in hydrophobic
ion channels, their behavior at the inner pores under different voltages (ΔU =~0.45 V,
0.3 V, 0.15 V, and 0 V) is the focus of this simulation. Computational
electrophysiology enabled the determination of a conducive conformation for ions.
The channel wetting/dewetting transitions appeared under different transmembrane
voltages, and the radius of the pore increased. Meanwhile, the capacity to contain
water molecules also increased. Further analysis of the trajectories revealed that the
monovalent cations (Na+ and K+) will permeate through the pore with water
molecules when the transmembrane voltage is > 0.3 V.
Computational electrophysiology also explained that the transmembrane voltage led
to an easier wetting transition for the channel. The range for keeping the channel open
should be between 0.15 V and2 0.45 V. Na+ and K+ could be cotransported during
water permeation, which is very similar to that in many hydrophobic channels

. Intriguingly, we did not observe Cl- conduction, which may be because chloride

ions could not overcome the energy barrier under the maximum transmembrane
voltage. In addition, the change in the pore radius at different voltages highlights two

important sites, where the geometric radius changes the most, corresponding to Leu10
and Phe19. Phe19 contains a benzene ring group at the hydrophobic surface of the
inner pore as a hydrophobic gate. The isopropyl group of Leu10 at the bottom of the
pore prevents the reverse penetration (Fig 6A). Previous studies indicated that
Asn15Val and Val25Phe mutations will make the channel dysfunctional. This may be
due to the additional side chain groups in the pores caused by these mutations
(especially the benzene ring in Val25Phe), making 1) the radius of the pores decrease
and 2) the hydrophobicity of the pores increase. In short, these mutations may
increase the energy barrier, negatively affecting the wetting transition and causing the
channel to be functionally closed.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer is a voltage-dependent hydrophobic
channel. We propose that the E protein may play an essential role in the virus
infection and replication processes through the following mechanisms: 1) The
monovalent selective permeation of the E protein pentamer ion channel may change
the intracellular pH, providing a suitable microenvironment for virus replication. 2)
Selective permeation can form a transmembrane voltage, creating feedback regulation
and maintaining an intracellular microenvironment that is suitable for viral growth. 3)
The disintegration of the ion equilibrium of the intracellular area affect the charges
coming from the cell through ion channels in the cell membrane, changing the pH and
making it easier for the virus to fuse with the cell membrane. This is the infection
mechanism of the avian coronavirus as well as some types of influenza viruses 49 50. 4)
It has a certain signal transduction function.

Conclusion
Although the pentameric SARS-CoV-2 E protein crystal structure is not yet available,
the channel conformation was built by homology modeling from the SARS-CoV E
protein pentamer. We characterized and estimated the channel’s stability, energy
barrier, voltage dependence and geometric properties by using MD simulations. Our
simulation results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer is a

voltage-dependent hydrophobic channel with monovalent cation selectivity. Water
molecules and monovalent cations can penetrate through the channel spontaneously
under a transmembrane voltage. Differences in the penetrability of E protein channels
may be responsible for the infectivity, inflammatory response and incubation period
of SARS-CoV-2, which is different from that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The
results further suggested that Leu10 and Phe19 are hydrophobic gates for ion
regulation and permeability. Our research reveals the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 E
protein pentamer, providing theoretical support for future research on vaccines against
E proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

Experimental methods
Preparation of the SARS-CoV-2 pentameric E protein-membrane simulation system
The amino acids sequence of the human coronaviruses E proteins were downloaded
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The Cluster-X
software was used for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) for the new human
coronavirus and the SARS-CoV E protein. The model was built for the SARS-CoV-2
E protein using the SWISSMODEL web server 51. As the SARS E protein (PDB ID:
5X29)

18

pentameric structure is the closest E protein to SARS-CoV-2, it was used

as a template for building the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. The Rampage web tool was
used to evaluate the rationality of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein model. Then, the model
was inserted in a DOPC/POPC,1:1 lipid bilayer via pre-equilibrium. The simulation
system was set as a 11×11×12 nm3 cubic box by CHARMM-GUI 52, comprising the
whole pentameric E-protein, 330 lipid molecules, ~30,000 TIP3P water molecules,
and concentration is 0.15 M Na+ and Cl- ions. Resulting in a simulation system size of
~120,000 atoms.

MD Simulaiton
To obtain the equilibrated pentameric SARS-CoV-2 E protein model, Charmm36
all-atom force field 53 was chosen for MD simulation. The MD time step was set at 2
fs. Electrostatic interactions were described using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)

with a cut-off of 1.2 nm. The LINCS algorithm

55

was used to constrain

the bond lengths. The pressure was maintained semi-isotropically at 1 bar at both x
and y directions using the Perinello-Rahman barostat algorithm

56

and the system

temperature was maintained at 310 K by the Nose-Hoover thermostat 57. Then, a 1000
ns (1 µs) MD simulations were performed for the E protein pentameric.

Umbrella sampling
The initial system for umbrella sampling simulations was derived from the
equilibrated pentameric SARS-CoV-2 E protein mentioned above. A single ion that
maintain physiological activity (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-) or water molecule was
placed at successive positions along the central pore axis by using GROMACS pull
code. Energy minimization was performed before simulation for optimizing the water
and ions position. The reaction coordinate defined from z +3 to -3 nm with the mass
center at z = 0 nm, with a spacing of 0.1 nm between successive windows, resulting in
60 umbrella sampling simulation systems. The probe ion or water molecules were
harmonically restrained by a force constant of 2000 kJ mol/nm2 same with the pore
direction. Each window was performed a 5 ns total umbrella sampling simulation. The
initial 2 ns for system equilibration, then a subsequent 3 ns was applied for analysis.
The PMFs were computed by the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM)

58

,

and the profile was generated by Gromacs protocol ‘g_wham’ 59. Bootstrap analysis
(N = 50) was used to estimate statistical error and the ‘-cycl’ parameter was used to
make the value equal.

Diffusion-coefficient calculation
The Diffusion-coefficient was calculated using the method described by Shirvanyants
et al.

. We restrained the E-protein pentamer helix backbones and made the side

chains, membrane, water and ions free to move. Due to the ion selectivity is related to
the side chain of inner pore

61

, the backbone restraint maintained the E-protein

pentamer tertiary structure but the side-chain flexibility in the inner pore was not
influenced. A K+ as the probe ion, the calculation system was used in the same

manner as for umbrella sampling. The ion mean-square displacement (MSD) was
calculated along the pore’s Z-axis. A total of 25 simulation systems were obtained,
each widows interval distance of the K+ being set as 0.24 nm. The umbrella restraint
was used to maintain the K+ ion’s position on the x-y plane of the pore. The Einstein
equation MSD=2D(z)t was used to calculate the diffusion coefficient by the protocol
g_msd. The umbrella restraint can be disregarded for these analyses because of the
restraint force was negligible compared to thermally induced RMS fluctuations.

CE simulations
Computational electrophysiology (CE) is a good tool for simulating the ion
conduction ability of a channel under transmembrane voltage. We established a
sandwich structure including three parts (membrane-protein-water) as described by
Kutzner et al. 62 as shown in Fig 4A, each water layer contained a different number of
ions. Due to the imbalance of the ion distribution of the water layer, the ions gradient
will produce transmembrane voltage. Specific transmembrane voltage can be applied
to the simulation system by adjusting the number of ions between the water layers. In
this study, we built the SARS-CoV-2 E protein sandwich system. The initial single
layer system was equilibrium for 50 ns to make the structures stable. Then the
single-layer system was duplicated along the z direction. The resulting system had a
size of around 11×11×22 nm3. The transmembrane voltage set with different ion
number of each parts.
∆𝑒 = 𝑛𝑢𝑚(1)𝑐𝑙− − 𝑛𝑢𝑚(2)𝑐𝑙− = 0e, 4e, 8e, 12e
The transmembrane potential was calculated using the implementation of the Poisson
equation ∇2 𝑈 = −𝜌/𝜀 in the GROMACS g_potential tool. After that, six 20 ns
simulations for each transmembrane voltage ware executed, the total simulation time
of CE is 6×20×4=480 ns.
