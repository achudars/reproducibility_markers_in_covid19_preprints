Abstract
COVID-19 is a new viral emergent human disease caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus.
This virus has caused a huge problem in the world as millions of the people are affected with
this disease in the entire world. We aimed to design a peptide vaccine for COVID-19
particularly for the envelope protein using computational methods to predict epitopes
inducing the immune system and can be used later to create a new peptide vaccine that could
replace conventional vaccines. A total of available 370 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were
retrieved from NCBI for bioinformatics analysis using Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) to
predict B and T cells epitopes. Then we docked the best predicted CTL epitopes with HLA
alleles. CTL cell epitopes namely interacted with MHC class I alleles and we suggested them
to become universal peptides based vaccine against COVID-19. Potentially continuous B cell
epitopes were predicted using tools from IEDB. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was
analyzed by AllerTOP tool and the coverage was determined throughout the worlds. We
found these CTL epitopes to be T helper epitopes also. The B cell epitope, SRVKNL and T
cell epitope, FLAFVVFLL were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based
vaccine against COVID-19. We hope to confirm our findings by adding complementary steps
of both in vitro and in vivo studies to support this new universal predicted candidate.

Introduction
As we all know the Corona virus has stopped the movements of the entire world. This virus is
so deadly that it is taking lives of the more than thousands of people every day and affecting
millions of people on the globe. Although the disease was first reported in the Wuhan city of
China, where the virus was isolated from a patient with respiratory symptom in Dec 2019, [1,
2] later identified it by the name of COVID-19 [3]. World Health Organization (WHO)
announced this disease as pandemic disease that spread from China to more than a hundred
countries in the world. By May 25, 2020, the disease had already struck more than million
persons of whom thousands of peoples died from COVID-19 infection majority of them were
reported from China, Italy, United State of America, Britain and Spain.

Corona viruses are the large group of viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the
order Nidovirales that are common among animals [4]. The coronaviridae family is divided
into four genera based on their genetic properties, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta
corona virus genus [5]. The 2019-nCoV is enveloped positive-sense RNA, Beta corona virus
with a genome of 29.9 kb [6]. They are zoonotic, transmitted from animals to humans [7].
Covid-19 affects the respiratory system (lungs and breathing tubes). Most COVID-19 patients
developed severe acute respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of
breath. Maximum reported cases of COVID-19 have been linked through travel to or
residence in countries in this region [8, 9].
Presently there are no clinically approved vaccines available in the world for this disease. The
development of new vaccine for this new emergent strain by using therapeutic and preventive
approach can be readily applied to save human lives. The use of peptides or epitopes as
therapeutics is a good strategy as it has advances in design, stability, and delivery [11, 12].
Moreover, there is a growing importance on the use of peptides in vaccine design by
predicting immunogenic CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes from tissue-specific proteins of
organisms [13, 14]. Among the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the CoV envelope (E)
protein is a small integral membrane protein involved in life cycle of virus. It involves in
envelope formation, and some other aspects like assembly formation, budding, and
pathogenesis. Thus, it is considered to be a promising target for effective COVID-19 vaccine
design [15]. More importantly, T-cell-based cellular immunity is essential for cleaning
SARS-CoV-2 infection because it is memory based [16, 17]. Also, the low mutation rate of
the E protein or it is a highly conserved protein that can elicits both cellular immunity, and
neutralizing antibody against COVID-19 is necessary for an efficient vaccine development
[18, 19].
Therefore, in this study, an immunoinformatics based approach was adopted to identify a
candidate epitopes against envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 that could be appropriately
activate a significant cellular, and humoral immune response [20, 21]. The aim of this study
is to analyze envelope protein strains using in silico approaches looking for the conservancy,
which is further studied to predict all potential epitopes that can be used after in vitro and in
vivo confirmation as a therapeutic peptide vaccine [22,23, 24].

Materials and Methods
Protein Sequence Retrieval
The protein sequence of envelope protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 isolate Indian strain (SARS-CoV-2/166/human/2020/IND) with accession no.
QIA98585.1 was retrieved from the NCBI. The antigenicity of this sequence was predicted
by the VaxiJen v2.0 server [25] with default parameter. In the present study, envelope protein
was found to be a potential antigenic protein with good antigenicity score. A total of 370
envelope protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database till 12 April 2020. These
370 sequences retrieved were collected from different parts of the world; retrieved sequences
and their accession numbers are listed in the supplementary file. Further, the multiple
sequence alignment of envelope protein sequences was carried out through clustal W.
Homology Modelling
Envelope protein 3D structure was obtained by Swissmodeller which uses homology
detection methods to build 3D models [26]. UCSF Chimera was used to visualize and
minimize the 3D structures [27], and structure validation was carried out with SAVES [28].
Homology modelling was achieved to establish conformational B cell epitope prediction and
for further verification of the surface accessibility and hydrophilicity of B lymphocyte
epitopes predicted, as well as to visualize all predicted T cell epitopes in the structural level.
B-cell Epitope Prediction
B cell epitope is the portion of an immunogen, which interacts with B-lymphocytes. As a
result, the B-lymphocyte is differentiated into an antibody-secreting plasma cell and the
memory cell. Thus, the IEDB resource was used for analysis. Envelope protein was subjected
to Bepipred linear epitope prediction [29], Emini surface accessibility [30], Kolaskar and
Tongaonkar antigenicity [31], Parker hydrophilicity [32], Chou and Fasman beta turn [33]
and Karplus & Schulz Flexibility Prediction [34] prediction methods in IEDB, that predict the
probability of specific regions in the protein to bind to B cell receptor, being in the surface,
being immunogenic, being in a hydrophilic region and being in a beta turn region,
respectively. Potentially continuous B cell epitope was predicted using tool Ellipro from
IEDB resource [35]. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed by AllerTOP Tool
[36]. ToxinPred server was used to predict toxicity assessment of epitopes [37].

MHC Class I binding predictions

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.115790; this version posted May 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.

T-cell epitopes were predicted by the NetCTL server [38]. The parameter was set at 50 to
have the highest specificity and sensitivity of 0.94 and 0.89, respectively and all the
supertypes were taken during the submission of a protein sequence. A combined algorithm of
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)-1 binding, Transporter of Antigenic Peptide
(TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal cleavage efficiency were used to predict the
overall scores [39]. On the basis of the combined score first, five best epitopes were selected
for further testing as putative epitope vaccine candidates. MHC-1 binding T cell epitope was
predicted by IEDB by using the Stabilized matrix method (SMM) for each peptide [40]. Prior
to prediction, all epitope lengths were set as 9mers, conserved epitopes that bind to many
HLA alleles at score equal or less than 1.0 percentile rank were selected. For further analysis,
alleles having IC50 less than 200 nm were selected. Overall, the higher immunogenicity of
peptides shows more expected to be CTL epitopes than those having lower immunogenicity.
Therefore, the IEDB immunogenicity prediction tool was used for the prediction of the
immunogenicity of the candidate epitopes [41].
Prediction of Helper T cell epitope
Analysis of peptide binding to MHC class II molecules was assessed by the IEDB MHC II
prediction tool, where SMM based NetMHCIIpan 3.0 server was used [42]. It covers all HLA
class II alleles including HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP [43]. IC50 below 200 nM show
maximum interaction potentials of HTL epitope and MHC II allele [44]. Accordingly, five
top epitopes were selected. The predicted HTL epitopes were submitted to the IFN epitope
server to check whether the MHCII binding epitopes had the ability to induce IFN-Î³ [45].
Population Coverage Calculation
All potential MHC I and MHC II binders from envelope protein were assessed for population
coverage against the whole world population that had been reported COVID-19 cases.
Calculations achieved using the selected MHC-I and MHC-II interacted alleles by the IEDB
population coverage calculation tool [46].
Docking studies
Epitopes of MHC I alleles that predicted to bind with percentile rank below 0.5 were selected
as the ligands, which are modeled using PEP- FOLD online peptide modeling tool [47]. The
receptor MHC I allele 3D structure was obtained from the PDB server [48]. Patchdock
program was used for all dockings [49]. PyMol and CHIMERA were used for visualization
and determination of binding affinity and to show the suitable epitopes binding with the
lowest energy.

Results
Retrieval of protein sequence and Antigenicity determination:
The protein sequence of envelope protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 isolate Indian strain retrieved in FASTA format was screened using the
VaxiJen server to predict the immunogenicity. In the present study, the QIA98585.1) was
predicted to be antigenic protein based on the overall score by the Vaxijen server and this has
been indicated as an immunogenic protein. A total of 370 envelope protein sequences
retrieved from the NCBI database were aligned, to see the conservation of predicted epitopes.
By means of IEDB analysis resource B and T cell epitopes were predicted and population
coverage was calculated.
Homology Modelling, Refinement, and Validation of E protein
Three-dimensional structure of envelope protein of the SARS-CoV-2 was modelled using the
homology structure modelling tool Swissmodeller (Fig.1). This protein showed a good model
with Swissmodeller by using PDB ID: 5X29 respectively as a template has more than 91%
identity and 54% similarity with the query structure. These models were energy minimized
by using Chimera. The Ramachandran plot and Prosa Z-score validation (Fig. 2) indicated
that >86% residues in the favoured region for the modelled envelope protein.

Prediction of conformational and linear B-cell Epitope
The conformational B-cell epitopes were also obtained in five chains of envelope protein by
using ElliPro. ElliPro gives the score to each output epitope, which is Protrusion Index (PI)
value averaged over each epitope residue [50]. Some ellipsoids approximated the tertiary
structure of the protein. The highest probability of a conformational epitope was calculated at
76% (PI score: 0.76). Residues involved in conformational epitopes, their number, location
and scores are shown in Table 1,

60

SRVKNL65 residues were found have highest PI score.

This epitope is antigenic, nonallergic, nontoxin, and conserved in SARS-CoV-2. Also, their
positions on 3D structures are shown in Fig 3. Proposed epitope of B cell is conserved in all
strains are shown here in the structural level of envelope protein of virus.

Prediction of Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Epitopes and Interaction with MHC Class I
Envelope protein from the SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using the IEDB MHC-1 binding
prediction tool to predict the T cell epitope suggested interacting with different types of MHC
Class I alleles. Based on NetCTL and SMM-based IEDB MHC-I binding prediction tools
with higher affinity (IC50 less than 200) were predicted to interact with different MHC-1
alleles. The predicted total score of proteasome score, tap score, MHC score, processing
score, and MHC-I binding are summarized as a total score in Table 2. These epitopes are
antigenic and nonallergic. The peptide FLAFVVFLL from 20 to 29 (Fig. 5) had higher
affinity to interact with 5 alleles (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*02:06, HLA-B*15:02, HLAC*03:03, and HLA-A*68:02), followed by FLLVTLAIL from 26 to 34, and LLFLAFVVF
from, 18 to 26 that had an affinity to interact with 5-6 alleles for each. The epitopes and their
corresponding MHC-1 alleles are shown in Table 2. Among these 5 T-cell epitopes, 9-mer

coverage analysis. The results of population coverage of all epitopes are listed in Table 2 and

3. FLAFVVFLL epitope that interacts with most frequent MHC class I and II alleles gave a
high percentage against the whole world population by the IEDB population coverage tool.
The maximum class I and II combined population coverage (84.88%) for this proposed
epitope was found in North America (Table-4), while the higher population coverage in

Molecular Docking of MHC I and II alleles with predicted T cell Epitope

The predicted T cell epitope FLAFVVFLL that interacted with selected humanâs MHC-1and
II alleles were used as ligands (Fig. 6) to detect their interaction with alleles /receptors, by
docking techniques using on-line software Patchdock. After successful docking by
PatchDock, the refinement and re-scoring of the docking results were carried out by the
FireDock server. After refinement of the docking scores, the FireDock server generates
global energies/ binding energies for the best solutions. Chimera was used to visualize the
best results. The 3D structure of epitopes was predicted using PEP-FOLD and energy
minimization was carried out by using Chimera. Based on the binding energy in kcal/mol
unit, the lowest binding energy (kcal/mol) was selected to obtain a best binding (pose) and to
predict real CTL and HTL epitope as possible.
The receptors used for docking studies included reported HLAs, HLA-C*03:03 (PDB ID:
1EFX) for class I and HLA-DRB1*01:01 (PDB ID: 1AQD) for class II. HLA-C*03:03 and
HLA-DRB1*01:01 was observed to have the interaction with the FLAFVVFLL epitope with
lower binding energy, -50.11 kCal/mol and -73.72 kCal/mol respectively (Fig. 7 and 8). The
predicted peptide showed significant binding affinities with all HLAs. Also, the binding

4. Discussion
In this study, we aimed to determine the highly potential immunogenic epitopes for B and T
cells, the prime molecules of humoral, and cell mediated immunity as peptide vaccine
candidates for COVID-19 infection using the envelope protein as a target. Conservancy in E
protein in the SARS-CoV-2 was found promising for peptide vaccine design. To determine
potential and effective peptide antigen for B cell epitopes should get above threshold scores
in Bepipred linear epitope prediction, Emini surface accessibility, Parker hydrophobicity,
Karplus & Schulz Flexibility Prediction, and Chou and Fasman beta turn prediction methods
in IEDB. SRVKNL epitope was found passing the thresholds of all prediction parameters in
envelope protein. SRVKNL epitope was found to be antigenic, non-toxin, nonallergic and
conserved in all sequences of SARS-CoV-2 consider in this study (supplementary file). The
conformational epitopes were predicted by using a 3D structure of the E protein. The B-cell
epitopes residues, SRVKNL located on the surface of the E protein had good Protrusion
Index (PI) score (0.76) were indicative of high accessibility. Ellipsoid value of PI 0.76
indicates that 76% of protein residues lie within ellipsoid and the remaining 24% residues lie
outside. PI score and solvent accessibility are directly proportional to each other if the PI
score is higher; maximum is the solvent accessibility of the residues [50]. Thus, this epitope
enables direct interactions with an immune receptor, which could be the putative vaccine
candidates.

Since the immune response of T cell is long lasting response comparing with B cell, where
the antigen can easily escape the antibody memory response [18] additionally, CD8+ T and
CD4+ T cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity [16], designing of a vaccine
against T cell epitope is much more promising. FLAFVVFLL epitope could be used as a
potential candidate because it had a maximum combined score and immunogenic score.
Moreover, it possessed the maximum number of HLA binding alleles amongst other CTL and
HTL. This epitope was found to be antigenic, non-toxin and nonallergic. An ideal epitope
should be highly conserved. The conservancy analysis of this epitopes indicated that this
epitope was found to have been conserved in all sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 consider in
this study. This consistency of immunological features of epitopes indicates that these
parameters fulfill all criteria of further screening. Further, docking study was performed with
FLAFVVFLL epitope to check interaction with MHC class I and II alleles. The binding
affinity of the epitope, FNLTLLEPV with MHC I and II alleles shows a very high binding
affinity with negative binding energy. This epitope alone showed 57% coverage in the world,
a maximum population coverage found in North America (85 %) and in East Asia (82%).
Also, the 9-mer CTL epitopes (16SVLLFLAFV24,
18

26

FLLVTLAIL34,

17

VLLFLAFVV26 and

LLFLAFVVF26) from 16 to 34 amino acid sequence of E protein were able to interact with

MHC class I alleles and could become universal peptide based vaccine against COVID-19.
We found these CTL epitopes to be HTL epitopes. The overlapping between MHC Class I
and II T cell epitopes suggested the possibility of antigen presentation to immune cells via
both MHC class I and II pathways especially the overlapping sequences.
To conclude, by using E protein one epitope, SRVKNL was proposed for an international
therapeutic peptide vaccine for B cell. Regarding T cell, the FLAFVVFLL epitope was
highly recommended as a therapeutic peptide vaccine to interact with both MHC class I and
II. We recommend in vitro and in vivo validation for the efficacy and efficiency of these
predicted candidate epitopes as a vaccine as well as to be used as a diagnostic screening test.
