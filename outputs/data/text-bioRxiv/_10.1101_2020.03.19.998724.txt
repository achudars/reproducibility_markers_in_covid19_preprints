Abstract
A recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has
spread rapidly all over the world. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is another deadly virus
and causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Rapid and early detection of these
viruses will facilitate early intervention and reduce disease transmission risk. Here, we present
an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed "AIOD-CRISPR") assay method for simple, rapid,
ultrasensitive, one-pot, and visual detection of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and HIV virus. In our
AIOD CRISPR assay, a pair of crRNAs was introduced to initiate dual CRISPR-Cas12a
detection and improve detection sensitivity. The AIOD-CRISPR assay system was
successfully utilized to detect nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV with a
sensitivity of few copies. Also, it was evaluated by detecting HIV-1 RNA extracted from human
plasma samples, achieving a comparable sensitivity with real-time RT-PCR method. Thus, our
method has a great potential for developing next-generation point-of-care molecular
diagnostics.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 (previously named 2019-nCoV) is a new coronavirus causing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) which first emerged in December 2019.1 As of 18 March 2020,
based on the data provided by the World Health Organization,2 191,127 people all over the
world have been infection-confirmed and 7807 people have died. Human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) is one of another most dangerous virus and causes acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were ~37.9
million people living with HIV.3 Early detection of such pathogen infections during
seroconversion window will facilitate early intervention (“test and treat”), which, in turn, may
reduce disease transmission risk.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is the most commonly used technology for pathogen
nucleic acid detection and has been considered as a “gold standard” for disease diagnostics
due to high sensitivity and specificity.4, 5, 6 However, it typically relies on expensive equipment
and well-trained personnel, all of which is not suitable for point of care diagnostic application.
In recent decades, several isothermal amplification methods, such as recombinase
polymerase amplification (RPA)7, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)8, have been
developed as attractive alternatives to conventional PCR method because of their simplicity,
rapidity and low cost. However, there is still a challenge to apply it to develop a reliable POC
diagnostics for clinical applications due to non-specific signals (e.g., false-positive).9, 10
Recently, RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas nuclease-based nucleic acid detection has shown great
promise for the development of next-generation molecular diagnostics technology due to its
high sensitivity, specificity and reliability.11, 12 For example, some Cas nucleases (e.g., Cas12a,
Cas12b and Cas13a) perform strong collateral cleavage activities in which a crRNA-targetbinding activated Cas can indiscriminately cleave surrounding non-target single-stranded
nucleic acids.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 By combining with RPA preamplification, Cas13 and Cas12a have,
respectively, been used to develop SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter
UnLOCKing) system18 and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter)
system14 for highly sensitive nucleic acid detection. Apart from RPA method, some CRISPRCas-based nucleic acid sensors utilized the LAMP and PCR approaches, for instance, the
CRISPR-Cas12b-assisted HOLMESv2 platform.16 However, these CRISPR-Cas-based
detection methods typically require separate nucleic acid pre-amplification and multiple
manual operations, which undoubtedly complicates the procedures and brings about
contaminations.
In this study, we reported an All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (termed "AIOD-CRISPR")
assay for rapid, ultrasensitive, specific and visual detection of nucleic acid. Dual crRNAs are
introduced to initiate highly efficient CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection. In our AIODCRISPR assay, all components for nucleic acid amplification and CRISPR detection are
thoroughly mixed in a single, one-pot reaction system and incubated at a single temperature
(e.g., 37 °C), eliminating the need for separate preamplification and amplified product
transferring. As application examples, the AIOD-CRISPR assay was engineered to detect
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)19 and human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).20 Since SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 are retrovirus, we
evaluated the performance of our AIOD-CRISPR assay by detecting both of their DNA and
RNA. Especially, the test results of our AIOD-CRISPR assay can be directly visualized by
naked eye. Therefore, we anticipate that the AIOD-CRISPR assay will facilitate CRISPRbased next-generation molecular diagnostics towards point-of-care applications.

Results
AIOD-CRISPR assay system. As shown in Figure 1A, the AIOD-CRISPR assay system used
a pair of Cas12a-crRNA complexes generated by two individual crRNAs to bind two
corresponding sites which are close to the recognition sites of primers in the target sequence.
The Cas12a-crRNA complexes were separately prepared prior to being loaded into the
solution containing two RPA primers, ssDNA-FQ reporters, recombinase, single-stranded
DNA binding protein (SSB), strand-displacement DNA polymerase, and target sequences.
When incubating the AIOD-CRISPR system in one pot at 37°C, RPA amplification is first
initiated and exposes the binding sites of the Cas12a-crRNA complexes due to the strand
displacement. Once the Cas12a-crRNA complexes bind the target sites, Cas12a
endonuclease is activated and cleaves the nearby ssDNA-FQ reporters to produce
fluorescence. Similarly, RPA amplified products are also the substrates to undertake the same
process and continuously trigger CRISPR-Cas12a-based collateral cleavage activity.
Previous study 14, 17 has demonstrated that this collateral cleavage activity is irrelevant to target
strand cleavage in CRISPR-Cas12a system. Therefore, target sequences for the AIODCRISPR assay are not limited by the Cas12a’s protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 21.
To evaluate and develop our AIOD-CRISPR assay, we prepared and tested eight reaction
systems (Reactions # 1-8) with various components (Figure 1B (i)). The ssDNA-FQ reporter
was a 5 nt oligonucleotide (5'-TTATT-3') labelled by 5' 6-FAM (Fluorescein) fluorophore and
3' Iowa Black® FQ quencher. After incubated at 37°C for 40 min, only reaction # 5 containing
the target sequence, dual crRNAs, Cas12a, and the RPA mix produced super-bright
fluorescence signal, which could be directly visualized in a LED blue or UV light illuminator.
Interestingly, even under ambient light environment without any excitation, a color change
from orange-yellow to green was observed in the reaction tube # 5 by naked eyes.
Furthermore, the assay products were verified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE). As shown in Figure 1B(ii), a strong band with shorter DNA size was
observed only in the lane of the reaction # 5, which resulted from the cleaved ssDNA-FQ
reporter with bright fluorescence. On the contrary, for other reaction systems, only weak bands
with slightly longer DNA sizes were observed in their corresponding lanes due to fluorescence
quench of the intact uncut ssDNA-FQ reporters. In addition, in real-time fluorescence detection,
only the reaction # 5 showed an elevated fluorescence signals that saturated within 13 min
(Figure 1B(iii)). Thus, these results show that our AIOD-CRISPR assay provides a simple,
rapid, one-pot approach for target-specific nucleic acid detection.
Since RPA amplification reaction is initiated after adding MgOAc,22 we are interested in
knowing if the nucleic acid amplification was initiated at room temperature during sample
preparation in our AIOD-CRISPR assay system. We prepared two AIOD-CRISPR solutions
(one positive and one negative) and allowed them to remain at room temperature for 10 min.
As shown in Figure S1, no significant fluorescence change between positive and negative
samples was observed in the AIOD-CRISPR solutions at room temperature. On the contrary,
there was an obvious fluorescence increasing after just one-min incubation at 37°C (Figure
S1). The fluorescence signal was eventually saturated at 15 min after incubated at 37°C.
Therefore, our AIOD-CRISPR assay system is mainly triggered only after reaction
temperature arrives at 37°C.

the AIOD-CRISPR assay system. The ssDNA-FQ reporter was labelled by 5' 6-FAM (Fluorescein)
fluorophore and 3' Iowa Black® FQ quencher. Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) mix from
TwistAmp® Liquid Basic kit was composed of 1× Reaction Buffer, 1× Basic E-mix, 1× Core Reaction
Buffer, 14 mM MgOAc, 320 nM each of primers and 1.2 mM dNTPs. Dual crRNAs contained 0.64 μM
each of crRNAs. HIV-1 p24 plasmid (1.2× 105 copies), 8 μM of ssDNA-FQ reporters, and 0.64 μM
EnGen® Lba Cas12a (Cpf1) were used. (i) Eight reaction systems with various components and their

Optimization of AIOD-CRISPR assay. Collateral cleavage of ssDNA-FQ reporter by the
Cas12a is triggered by the binding of crRNA to target sites.13, 14 Thus, we hypothesized that
higher binding opportunities could increase the collateral cleavage activity and eventually
improve the detection sensitivity for AIOD-CRISPR. To prove this, we introduced a pair of
crRNAs to recognize the corresponding target sites. A pUCIDT-AMP plasmid containing 300
bp HIV-1 p24 gene cDNA (p24 plasmid) was used as the target and three different designs for
primers and crRNAs were investigated (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, AIOD-CRISPR
with dual crRNAs (crRNA1+crRNA2) shows similar fluorescence curve as that with crRNA2,
but was much better than using crRNA1 in real-time detection. Doubling the amount of crRNA1
or crRNA2 actually didn’t benefit the detection efficiency. On detection sensitivity, Figure 2C
shows that AIOD-CRISPR with dual crRNAs was able to detect as low as 1.2 copies of the
p24 plasmid templates within 40 min, while AIOD-CRISPR with single crRNA2 doesn’t detect
it. Thus, introducing dual crRNAs is beneficial to improve the sensitivity of AIOD-CRISPR
assay.
We further optimized ssDNA-FQ reporters in our the AIOD-CRISPR assay because the
reporter concentration is crucial in fluorescence readout. As shown in Figure S2A, higher

concentration of ssDNA-FQ reporters was used, shorter time was taken to reach saturated
fluorescence intensity. As to threshold time and visual detection, the minimal concentration for
saturated values was 4 μM (Figure S2B-S2D). Collateral cleavage by activated Cas12a is an
activity of cutting nearby ssDNA-FQ reporters.13, 14 Thus, increasing ssDNA-FQ reporter
concentration can strengthen the fluorescence signals. In addition, primer concentration also
affected the AIOD-CRISPR’s efficiency. As shown in Figure S3, the optimal concentration
should be 0.32 μM. Together, introducing dual crRNAs and using high concentration of
ssDNA-FQ reporters enable efficient AIOD-CRISPR with 0.32 μM of each primer.

control reaction. Each reaction contained 2 μM ssDNA-FQ. Fluorescence images were taken after 40

HIV-1 detection by AIOD-CRISPR assay. To investigate its sensitivity for HIV-1 DNA
detection, we first applied the optimized AIOD-CRISPR assay to detect various copies of HIV1 p24 plasmid templates (from 1.2× 100 to 1.2× 105 copies). As shown in Figure 3A, the AIODCRISPR could detect as low as 1.2 copies HIV-1 p24 plasmid DNA in both real-time and
endpoint visual detection in 40 min, which was further verified by the denaturing PAGE (Figure
3B). Although incubated for 40 min, the AIOD-CRISPR actually could identify 1.2 copies of
HIV-1 DNA in just 1 min incubation based on endpoint fluorescence as shown in Figure 3C,
which showed that our AIOD-CRISPR assay provides a super-fast and ultra-sensitive
approach for nucleic acid detection.

Next, we applied the AIOD-CRISPR assay to detect HIV-1 RNA sequence by adding Avian
Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) Reverse Transcriptase, namely reverse transcription AIODCRISPR (RT-AIOD-CRISPR). The HIV RNA target is a 1057-nt fragment of gag (p24 included)
gene prepared using T7 promotor-tagged RT-PCR and T7 RNA polymerase-based
transcription (Figure S4A). The detection region of AIOD-CRISPR was further verified by
Sanger sequencing (Figure S4B). To achieve highly sensitive HIV RNA detection, we
optimized the AMV concentration. As shown in Figure S4C, the RT-AIOD-CRISPR performed
the highest efficiency with 0.32 U/μL AMV when incubated at 37°C. Furthermore, we
investigated the sensitivity of our RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay using 1.1× 100,1.1× 101, 1.1× 103,
and 1.1× 105 copies of HIV-1 gag RNA templates. Figure 4A shows that RT-AIOD-CRISPR
incubated for 40 min at 37°C was able to consistently detect 11 copies RNA targets in realtime, endpoint fluorescence, and visual detections under LED blue and UV light. However,
visual detection without excitation light only identified 1.1× 105 copies RNA targets due to
unsaturated fluorescence for other reactions. Additionally, the RT-AIOD-CRISPR’s sensitivity
was further confirmed by denaturing PAGE analysis (Figure S5).

In addition to assaying artificial HIV-1 gag RNA, we also analysed RT-AIOD-CRISPR’s
performance using HIV-1 RNA extracted from plasma samples. As shown in Figure 4B, realtime RT-AIO-Cas12aR-based detection was able to detect the viral RNA extracted from 500
copies/μL HIV-1 plasma sample, though displaying low fluorescence change in less than 20
min. However, visual RT-AIOD-CRISPR detection took relatively long incubation time (up to
90 min) to achieve the similar sensitivity. The reduced efficiency of RT-AIOD-CRISPR likely
results from some potential inhibitors or disruptors in the extracts. Despite this, real-time AIODCRISPR assay was still comparable to real-time RT-PCR assay regarding the same detection
sensitivity (Figure 4C and S6).
SARS-CoV-2 detection by AIOD-CRISPR assay. As shown in Figure 5A, a pUCIDT-AMP
plasmid containing 384 nt SARS-CoV-2 N gene cDNA (N plasmid) was first prepared as the
target to develop our AIOD-CRISPR assay. Figure 5B shows that our AIOD-CRISPR assay
could detect 1.3 copies of SARS-CoV-2 N plasmids in both real-time and visual detections
within 40 min, offering a rapid and nearly single-molecule level sensitive detection. To evaluate
the detection specificity, we tested our AIOD-CRISPR assay using commercially available
control plasmids containing the complete N gene from SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 _PC),
SARS (SARS-CoV_PC), and MERS (MERS-CoV_PC), as well as the Hs_RPP30 control
(Hs_RPP30_PC) with a portion of human RPP30 gene. Figure 5C shows that only the
reaction with SARS-CoV-2_PC shows the positive signal in both real-time and visual

detections, demonstrating that our developed AIOD-CRISPR assay possesses high specificity
without cross reactions for non-SARS-CoV-2 targets.
Next, we used T7 promotor-tagged PCR and T7 RNA polymerase to prepare SARS-CoV-2 N
gene RNA sequences to develop the RT-AIOD-CRISPR assay (Figure 6A). The detection
region of RT-AIOD-CRISPR was verified by Sanger sequencing (Figure 6B). As shown in
Figure 6C, both real-time and visual AIOD-CRISPR-based detections could detect down to
4.6 copies of SARS-CoV-2 N RNA targets in 40 min. Therefore, our AIOD-CRISPR assay is
demonstrated to be a rapid, highly sensitive and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection method.

Discussion
In this study, we describe a new CRISPR-Cas12a reaction, AIOD-CRISPR in which all
components are incubated in a single reaction system to rapidly, highly sensitively and
specifically detect nucleic acids without separate preamplification steps. Upon the design of
AIOD-CRISPR, dual crRNAs are introduced to improve the sensitivity and high-concentration

ssDNA-FQ reporters are added to strengthen the detection signals. In addition to real-time
detection, AIOD-CRISPR assay is also beneficial for point-of-care detection because its
detection results can be visually judged based on the fluorescence and color change of
reaction solutions. As proof-of-concept assays, AIOD-CRISPR has been successfully
developed for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 detection.
Compared to previously reported CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection,14, 16, 18, 23, 24, 25 our
versatile and robust AIOD-CRISPR has some distinctive advantages. First, AIOD-CRISPR
system is a true single reaction system. All the components are prepared prior to incubation,
thoroughly circumventing the preamplification of target nucleic acids,14 physical separation of
Cas enzyme,25 or the requirement of specially designed tubes or devices26. Second, AIODCRISPR is a true isothermal nucleic acid detection method. AIOD-CRISPR is conducted in
one-step and one-pot format at one temperature, eliminating the need of expensive
thermocycler in PCR methods and the initial denaturing of dsDNA targets in isothermal nucleic
acid amplification techniques such as LAMP 8 and SDA 27. Third, AIOD-CRISPR-based
detection is very fast, robust, highly specific, and nearly single-molecule sensitive. In the
application examples of HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 detections, our engineered AIOD-CRISPR
without preamplification is able to detect as low as 1.2 copies DNA targets and 4.6 copies
RNA targets in 40 min incubation. Especially in detecting HIV-1 p24 plasmids, AIOD-CRISPR
can stably identify 1.2 copies in just 1 min incubation. For emerging SARS-CoV-2, in addition
to high sensitivity, the AIOD-CRISPR also performs high detection specificity. Compared to
the reported real-time RPA 28, AIOD-CRISPR shows a robust HIV-1 detection with very low
background. Fourth, the AIOD-CRISPR enables one-step CRISPR-Cas12a-based RNA
detection. By supplementing AMV reverse transcriptase, AIOD-CRISPR can be easily
developed as one-step RT-AIOD-CRISPR to detect RNA targets such as HIV-1 and SARSCoV-2 RNAs, which facilitates the CRISPR-Cas12a-based RNA detection without the
preparation of cDNA. On detecting HIV-1 plasma samples, AIOD-CRISPR is comparable to
real-time RT-PCR assay.
In summary, AIOD-CRISPR using a true single reaction system is a rapid, robust, highly
specific, and nearly single-molecule sensitive isothermal nucleic acid detection method. This
straightforward CRISPR-Cas12a nucleic acid sensing system has great potential in enabling
CRISPR-based next-generation molecular diagnostics towards point-of-care, quantitation,
and digital analysis.

AIOD-CRISPR assays. The AIOD-CRISPR system was prepared separately as Component
A, B and C. Component A contained 1× Reaction Buffer, 1× Basic E-mix, 14 mM MgOAc, 320
nM each of primers, and 1.2 mM dNTPs. Component B consisted of 4 μM of ssDNA-FQ
reporters and 1× Core Reaction Buffer. Component C was the Cas12a-crRNA mix with 0.64

fluorescence was the raw fluorescence determined by the Real-Time PCR Detection System.
The unpaired t-test was applied for the statistical analysis in GraphPad Software Prism 8. A
saturated fluorescence intensity was the maximum intensity which the Real-Time PCR
Detection System could determine. After reaction, the AIOD-CRISPR solution was mixed with
isometric Gel Loading Buffer II prior to 15% denaturing PAGE with 8 M urea and gel imaging
in the Imaging System.
In vitro RNA preparation using T7 RNA polymerase. For HIV-1 gag RNA, OneStep RTPCR composed of 1× QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 0.6 μM of
each primer, 2.0 μL of QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, and 1.0 μL of the viral RNA
extracted from HIV-1 plasma control was conducted to amplify the 1057 nt gag sequence. The
thermal cycling protocol included 30 min at 50°C for reverse transcription, 15 min at 95°C for
initial PCR activation, 35 cycles of the 3-step cycling (1 min at 94°C for denaturation, 1 min at
55°C for annealing, and 1 min at 72°C for extension), and 10 min at 50°C for final extension.
For SARS-CoV-2 N RNA, the PCR system contained 1× SsoAdvanced™ Universal SYBR®
Green PCR Supermix, 0.4 μM of each primer, and 1.0 μL of 1.2× 105 copies/μL HIV-1 p24
plasmid solution was used to amplify the 316 nt N sequence. The thermal cycling was 2.5 min
at 98°C for initial denaturation, 35 cycles of 15 s at 95°C for denaturation and 30 s at 60°C for
annealing and extension. The products of PCR/RT-PCR were all confirmed by agarose gel
electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. Afterwards, the products with the accurate sizes
were extracted and purified using the Gel Extraction Kit. In vitro transcription was achieved
through incubating the reaction system containing 8 μL of 5× T7 Transcription Buffer, 3 μL
each of 100 mM rNTPs, 4 μL of the Enzyme Mix with T7 RNA polymerase, 16 μL of the gelextracted PCR/RT-PCR products at 37°C for 4 h. Then, the transcription products were treated
by DNase (from the TURBO DNA-free TM Kit) to degrading the DNA and the RNA was
extracted and purified using the RNeasy@ MinElute TM Cleanup Kit. The purity and
concentration of the collected RNA were determined using NanoDrop™
One/OneC Microvolume UV-Vis Spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

PCR Buffer, 400 µM of each dNTP, 600 nM each of primers (FP and RP), 2.0 μL of QIAGEN
OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 0.8× EvaGreen® dye, and 5.0 μL of the RNA template solution.
The thermal cycling protocol included 30 min at 50°C for reverse transcription, 15 min at 95°C
for initial PCR activation step, 35 cycles of the 3-step cycling (30 s at 94°C for denaturation,
30 s at 55°C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for extension), and 10 min at 72°C for final
extension, followed by the melt-curve analysis (from 65 °C to 95 °C with 0.5 °C increment).
Real-time OneStep RT-PCR assay was conducted in the CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR
Detection System and the plate read was set at the annealing in the 3-step cycling.
