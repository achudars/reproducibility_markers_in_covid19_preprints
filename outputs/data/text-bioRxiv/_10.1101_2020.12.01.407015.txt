One Sentence Summary:
Children have elevated frequencies of pathogen-specific class-switched memory B cells,
including SARS-CoV-2-binding clones.

Abstract:
Vaccination and infection promote the formation, tissue distribution, and clonal evolution of B
cells encoding humoral immune memory. We evaluated convergent antigen-specific antibody
genes of similar sequences shared between individuals in pediatric and adult blood, and deceased
15

organ donor tissues. B cell memory varied for different pathogens. Polysaccharide antigenspecific clones were not exclusive to the spleen. Adults’ convergent clones often express mutated
IgM or IgD in blood and are class-switched in lymphoid tissues; in contrast, children have
abundant class-switched convergent clones in blood. Consistent with serological reports, prepandemic children had class-switched convergent clones to SARS-CoV-2, enriched in cross-

20

reactive clones for seasonal coronaviruses, while adults showed few such clones in blood or
lymphoid tissues. These results extend age-related and anatomical mapping of human humoral
pathogen-specific immunity.

Main Text:
Clonal proliferation of lymphocytes is critical for the adaptive immune system to respond to
pathogens. The clonal identity of a B cell can be traced by the sequence of its B cell receptor
5

(BCR), which determines its antigen specificity (1-3). Immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences are
formed via irreversible V(D)J gene segment rearrangement and can be diversified through
somatic hypermutation (SHM) (4) and class-switch recombination (CSR) (5). Convergent or
“public” Ig sequences showing similar antibody gene rearrangements can be found in the
primary BCR repertoires of naive B cells, owing to biases in V(D)J gene recombination

10

mechanisms, but are enriched in individuals exposed to the same antigen, reflecting an antigendriven selection for particular sequence features in the Ig heavy (IGH) or Ig light chain
complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops of the BCR (6-12). These Ig sequences, when
detected in antigen-experienced B cells, document previous infections and allow for the
reconstruction of the immunological memory of an individual. Recently, high-throughput

15

sequencing (HTS) has been applied to study convergent IGH repertoires across individuals in
response to vaccination and infection (11-14). It is still unclear, however, how our immune
memories to different antigens distribute in immunological tissues and change during an
individual’s lifespan.

20

The immune system gradually matures and accumulates immunological memory from infancy
onward (15). The immune responses to some pathogens appear to differ between young children
and adults. For example, young children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can
achieve neutralizing antibody breadth relatively early after infection, via different mechanisms
than adults (16). Data emerging from the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

pandemic show that children usually have milder symptoms than adults (17-22), potentially due
to differences of viral receptor expression and other host factors, but also, as a recent serological
study suggests, elevated pre-pandemic frequencies of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binding and neutralizing antibodies in children, stimulated by
5

other coronavirus infections (23, 24). During the COVID-19 pandemic, infected children
compared to adults have lower SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers and a predominance of IgG
antibodies specific for the S protein but not the N protein, with these differences attributed to
faster clearance of virus limiting the amount of viral antigens produced in the body (25). The
ways in which B cell clonal populations specific for coronaviruses and other pathogens may

10

differ between children and adults is unknown. Most studies of human B cells rely on peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which represent a small part of an individual’s full IGH
repertoire, with secondary lymphoid tissues in lymph nodes, spleen, and the gastrointestinal tract
harboring larger numbers of B cells and being major sites for SHM and CSR (26, 27).
Specialized immune responses in some lymphoid tissues have been reported; for example,

15

antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens are decreased in the absence of functional splenic
tissue (28-33). It is still unclear if B cell clones are widely dispersed in different secondary
lymphoid tissues or enriched in particular tissues depending on their antigen or pathogen
specificity.

20

To better understand how the antigen-specific B cell memory compartment changes through the
human lifespan, and distributes itself across immunological tissues, we systematically
characterized the convergent IGH repertoires specific to six common pathogens or vaccine types,
and two viruses not encountered by the participants (Ebola virus and SARS-CoV-2) in pre-

COVID-19 pandemic individuals from newborns to 87 years of age, and in tissues including cord
blood, peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes. For blood B cell analysis, we analyzed 12 cord
blood samples, 93 peripheral blood samples from 51 children (34), 122 healthy human adult
peripheral blood samples (34), and eight blood samples from deceased organ donors (table S1)).
5

All children were known to be exposed to Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcus
pneumoniae (PP), tetanus toxoid (TT), and influenza virus (Flu) antigens via vaccination, and it
is highly likely that all were exposed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in their first three years
of life (35). The children did not receive Neisseria meningitidis (NM) vaccination. The detailed
vaccination histories of the adults are unknown. To identify convergent IGH sequences for the

10

six pathogens in blood samples, we clustered IGH reads with known pathogen-specific reference
IGH sequences (table S2) based on their IGHV and IGHJ gene segment usage, CDR-H3 length,
and at least 85% CDR-H3 amino acid sequence similarity (see Methods).

We hypothesized that cord blood samples would show the least evidence of convergent
15

pathogen-specific IGH gene sequences, if these IGH were in fact truly stimulated by pathogen or
vaccine exposures. Indeed, we found only low frequencies of convergent B cell clones, and only
expressed as unmutated IgM or IgD, in the cord blood repertoires (Fig. 1A, age zero years old).
In contrast, convergent clones for Hib, NM, PP, TT, RSV, and Flu in children (one to three years
of age) and adults (17-87 years of age) usually expressed mutated IgM or IgD or class-switched

20

isotypes (Fig. 1A and fig. S1). There was a higher frequency of Hib, PP, TT and RSV convergent
clones in the blood from children compared to adult blood (Fig. 1B). The childhood vaccination
schedule (table S3) ensured immunization of the children to Hib, PP, and TT with immunizations
at approximately 2, 4, 6 months, and again between 12-15 months of life; NM is not given as an

vaccination events compared to the detection of convergent IGH did not show significant
correlation (fig. S2-S4), suggesting that children have persistently elevated frequencies of

Fig. 1. Frequency, class-switching and SHM state of pathogen-specific convergent clones in
individuals of different ages. (A) The frequency of IGH sequences of convergent clones for
different pathogens in blood samples from individuals of different ages. Each point represents
the sum of clone frequencies for that pathogen in the indicated antibody type for that sample,
5

with frequencies plotted on a square root scale. Convergent clones were split into unmutated
IgM/IgD clones (≤ 1% SHM), mutated IgM/IgD+ clones (>1% SHM) and class-switched clones.
Ages are in years, with age 0 indicating cord blood. (B) Odds ratios (ORs) for detection of
convergent clones in children compared to adults were calculated based on the fraction of
convergent clones for each pathogen among the total clones in children and in adults. The points

10

were colored by p-values calculated by Fisher’s exact test. (C) The fraction of convergent clones
expressing unmutated IgM/IgD, mutated IgM/IgD, class-switched, or combinations of these
three groups. Each point represents the fraction of convergent clones in each category to the total
convergent clones for that pathogen in an individual. Cord blood samples are not shown, as
almost all sequences in these specimens are unmutated IgM and IgD. To compare the frequency

15

of class-switched convergent clones with mutated IgM/IgD clone members (colored in purple)
between children and adults, the p-values were calculated by Wilcoxon–Mann-Whitney test, pvalue = 5.08e-32, 6.66e-29, 8.25e-29, 9.93e-35, 1.71e-41 for Hib, NM, PP, TT, and RSV,
respectively. The frequency of those convergent clones for Flu are not significantly different
between children and adults. (D) The IGHV-gene SHM frequencies of each convergent clone in

SHM frequency of each convergent cluster expressing each isotype. Clones with median SHM
frequency less than or equal to 1% are colored in pink, and those with median SHM frequency
more than 1% are in blue. The SHM frequencies of convergent clones expressing IgG or IgA

were lower in children than in adults, p-value = 6.50e-13 and 1.96e-8, respectively, by
Wilcoxon–Mann-Whitney test.

In analyzing antibody isotype expression by convergent clones, we classified clonal lineages into
5

three groups: 1) those containing only unmutated IgM or IgD (unmutM/D), most likely derived
from naïve B cells that have not undergone antigen-driven proliferation and diversification; 2)
those containing IgM or IgD with median SHM frequencies over 1%, but no class-switched
members (mutM/D); and 3) those containing class-switched members (CS) with or without IgM
or IgD clone members. In adult blood, frequencies of mutM/D convergent clones specific for

10

Hib, NM, and RSV were higher than unmutM/D convergent clones to these pathogens (fig.
S5A). In contrast, the frequency of CS but not mutM/D convergent clones specific for PP, TT,
and Flu in adults was higher than unmutM/D clones specific for these antigens (fig. S5A). These
data suggest that non-switched memory B cell populations in adults are the predominant antigenexperienced B cells for some vaccines with prominent polysaccharide antigens (Hib, NM), but

15

also for the glycoproteins of RSV. Surprisingly, higher frequencies of CS convergent clones
were detected in child blood compared to adult blood for Hib, NM, PP, TT, and RSV (fig. S5B)
even for pathogens with prominent polysaccharide antigens. A high fraction of the children’s CS
convergent clones to Hib, NM, PP, TT, and RSV also contained mutated IgM expressing (IgM+)
and IgD expressing (IgD+) clone members (Fig. 1C). Both adults and children had a high

20

fraction of CS convergent clones for influenza (Fig. 1A).

Median SHM frequencies for IgM+ or IgD+ convergent clones for each pathogen were similar
between adults and children (from 2% to 5%) whereas SHM frequencies of IgG+ or IgA+

convergent clones were significantly lower in children (Fig. 1D), in agreement with our prior
observations of total IGH repertoires for these isotypes (34). We observed an increase of SHM
up to age 87 years in IgG+ convergent clones for Flu, likely due to the recurrent exposures to
influenza antigens by infection, or annual influenza vaccination, in contrast to the other
5

pathogens.
Potential explanations for the lower frequencies of CS B cell convergent clones in adult
compared to pediatric blood could be that the CS clone members gradually die off after
childhood exposures, or that they are localized elsewhere in the body in adults, or that the clones

10

specific for individual vaccines or pathogens are diluted by the larger overall pools of memory
clones in adults and therefore at too low a frequency to be detected. To test the hypothesis that
these cells were in other tissues in adults, we analyzed IGH repertoires in the spleen, mediastinal
lymph node (MDLN), and mesenteric lymph node (MSLN) in eight adult deceased organ donors
(table S1).

15

In each deceased organ donor, we compared overall clone distributions within and between
secondary lymphoid tissues and to those found in blood. As expected, blood B cells had higher
frequencies (mean proportion: 43.8%) of naïve-like clones expressing unmutated IgM or IgD,
compared to lymphoid tissues (mean proportion: 20% for MDLN and MSLN, 18.7% for spleen)
20

(fig. S6A). The blood showed limited sharing of clones with lymphoid tissues, while higher
frequencies of shared clones were found among the lymph node and spleen, suggest larger clone
sizes in the lymphoid tissues, and limited recirculation in the blood (fig. S6A). Although many
clones were found in at least two tissues, the larger clones amongst those detected were not
evenly distributed: each tissue was dominated by different clones (fig. S6B). Clonal lineages

with members shared between different tissues fell into two main categories: those that express
IgM and IgA, or those expressing IgG subclasses (fig. S7A, B). SHM frequencies positively
correlated with the number of distinct tissue sites in which a clone was found (fig. S7C),
suggesting that clones that have been stimulated the most by prior antigen exposures become the
5

most widely distributed in the body.

The frequency of B cell convergent clones for Hib, NM, PP, TT, RSV, and Flu in lymph nodes
and spleen of deceased organ donors was significantly higher than in blood (Fig. 2A). Prior
clinical reports also suggest that different lymphoid tissues may have specialized functions in
10

protective immunity, such as enrichment of B cells specific for bacterial capsular
polysaccharides in splenic tissue, leading to vulnerability to these pathogens in splenectomized
patients (28-33). We tested whether each tissue site showed tissue-specific convergent IGH to
particular pathogens, for example, whether spleen had more clonal lineages specific for
polysaccharide antigens. Surprisingly, the frequencies of convergent clones for Hib, NM and PP

15

in the two lymph node sites were similar or even higher than in spleen, indicating that the spleen
may be a major reservoir of such clones, but is not the only source of them. Convergent IGH for
polysaccharide antigens were usually expressed as IgM or IgD, and less often IgG (Fig. 2B) in
lymphoid tissues. Convergent clones for PP were found expressing IgG in MSLN and spleen,
and IgA in MDLN, however, indicating that the convergent clones for polysaccharide antigens

20

can also be class-switched. One of the deceased organ donors (Donor 5) had a cause of death
reported as anoxia related to influenza H1N1 infection with the 2009 pandemic strain. We noted
that that this deceased donor had very few convergent clones for influenza in any of their
lymphoid tissues or blood (fig. S8). Although a single example does not permit generalization,

we had anticipated that the infection would have stimulated expansion of convergent clones for
influenza; it seems possible that the lack of such clones was associated with an ineffective
immune response to the infection.

more likely to match the same known pathogen-specific IGH sequences, compared to IGH
sequences from adult blood (including both the eight donor blood and the other 114 adult blood
samples), indicating that localization of these clones differs between children and adults (Fig. 2C
5

and fig. S9). Mean CDR-H3 lengths (fig. S10A) and IGHV gene usage (fig. S10, B and C) of
convergent clones were not significantly different between cord blood, pediatric or adult blood,
or adult lymphoid tissues.

Prompted by a recent serological report of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies in the
10

blood of children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (24), we next tested if we could detect
convergent B cell clones for pathogens that had not been encountered by the study subjects. It
has been reported that 40%-60% of healthy people with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection
mount CD4+ T-cell responses to peptides from this virus (36), but published evidence for SARSCoV-2-binding B cells in unexposed people has been limited to relatively rare individuals who

15

had prior infection with SARS-CoV (37), or examples likely derived from naive B cells
expressing stereotypic IGH with IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 and IGHJ6 gene segments (38). The
infants, children and adults in this study had not been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or Ebola virus
(EBOV). We detected rare examples of convergent clones for EBOV in the unmutM/D
compartment in both adult and pediatric blood, and in adult lymphoid tissues (Fig. 3, A and B).

20

In stark contrast, convergent clones with IGH similar to SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing
antibodies (Table 1, table S4) were common in the blood of children one to three years old, and
in 37 of 51 children showed SHM with or without class-switching, providing evidence of prior
antigen exposure (Fig. 3A, C). Cord blood lacked these mutated and class-switched sequences,

further supporting a role for antigen stimulation in their development (Fig. 3A). Adults had lower
frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 convergent clones in blood compared to the children, with some
IgM or IgD clones having SHM, but almost no class-switched examples (Fig. 3A). We tested
whether convergent SARS-CoV-2 B cell clones in adults might be localized to lymphoid tissues
5

rather than circulating in the blood, but found similarly low clone frequencies, with comparable
SHM frequencies to those in the blood, without class switching, in lymph nodes and spleen (Fig.
3B, C, D). Notably, about 7% of the SARS-CoV-2 convergent IGHs in children were similar to
known antibodies that cross-react with other human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as HKU1,
NL63, and 229E, which are continuously circulating in the population (37) (Fig. 3E). None of

10

the convergent clones for SARS-CoV-2 in adults were similar to IGH previously reported to bind
other HCoVs, with the exception of SARS-CoV. These results suggest that children have higher
frequencies than adults of cross-reactive spike-binding memory B cells stimulated by other
HCoV exposures, leading to the pre-pandemic cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 binding and
neutralizing antibody titers recently described in children(24). We note that both adults and

15

children had relatively high frequencies of convergent SARS-CoV-2 antibody clones detected in
naive B cell-derived unmutated IgM and IgD, indicating that these clonotypes have high
generation frequencies in the primary B cell repertoires (Fig. 3A). The cross-reactive B cell
memory and serum antibodies could contribute to the milder illnesses caused by SARS-CoV-2 in
children, in combination with other factors such as decreased expression of the angiotensin-

20

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) viral receptor protein in the airway (39). Relatively rapid decreases
in antibody titers specific for various coronaviruses in adults have been previously reported (40,
41), suggesting a lack of long-lived plasma cells producing secreted antibodies. Given that the
adults in our study were once children, and are likely to have been exposed periodically to

coronavirus infections may not stimulate long-lasting memory B cell responses, particularly of

Our findings clarify several features of human B cell selection in people of different ages, and in
different lymphoid tissues in adults. The immune responses of early childhood are particularly
5

important in an individual’s life, as they form the original memory B cell pools and shape future
responses (42). Our data show that individuals with diverse underlying genotypes can respond to
common pathogens and vaccine antigens in a conserved manner (producing some highly similar
convergent clones in response to the same antigen), and those convergent clones are found at
higher frequency and more often as class-switched isotypes in the blood of children compared to

10

adults. Among adults, these convergent clones are instead enriched in lymph nodes and spleen. B
cell memory to antigens that are frequently encountered by infection or vaccination, such as
those of influenza viruses, show similar clone frequencies and isotype switching between

children and adults, but demonstrate progressive increases in SHM frequencies over the human
lifespan. In contrast to ideas of tissue-enriched B cell populations for particular antigens, such as
bacterial capsular polysaccharide-specific B cells in the spleen, the B cell clones likely to be
specific for these antigens are found at similar frequencies in the spleen and lymph nodes.

Our data also highlight important differences in potential cross-reactive B cell responses to novel
pathogens in children and adults. Young children and adults both showed very little evidence for
IGH specific for EBOV, consistent with their lack of exposure to Ebola or related viruses.
Notably, young children have class-switched and mutated clones with similarity to known
10

SARS-CoV-2 specific IGH, particularly for clones known to be cross-reactive for binding the
spike antigens of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, raising the possibility that previous
HCoV exposures provide preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in children. The lack of such
class-switched cross-reactive memory in adults, in both blood and lymphoid tissues, adds further
support for the notion that serum antibody responses as well as B cell memory to coronaviruses

15

may be short-lived. More detailed knowledge of the role of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B
cell populations in new immune responses, and the determinants of long-lived B cell memory
and plasma cell formation will be important for the development of safe, effective vaccines to
SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogens.
