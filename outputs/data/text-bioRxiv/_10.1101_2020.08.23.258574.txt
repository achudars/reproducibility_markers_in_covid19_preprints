ABSTRACT
Cardiac injury and dysfunction occur in COVID-19 patients and increase the risk of
mortality. Causes are ill defined, but could be through direct cardiac infection and/or
‘cytokine-storm’ induced dysfunction. To identify mechanisms and discover cardioprotective therapeutics, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac
organoids with high throughput phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA
sequencing. We identify that ‘cytokine-storm’ induced diastolic dysfunction can be
caused by a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1β and poly(I:C) and also human
serum from COVID-19 patients. Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) is activated along with
pathology driving fibrotic and induced nitric oxide synthase genes. BRD inhibitors
fully recover function in hCO and completely prevent death in a cytokine-storm
mouse model. BRD inhibition decreases transcription of multiple genes, including
fibrotic, induced nitric oxide synthase and ACE2, and reduces cardiac infection from
SARS-CoV2. Thus, BRD inhibitors are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19
mediated cardiac damage.

MAIN
SARS-CoV2 infection leads to cardiac injury and dysfunction in 20-30% of hospitalized
patients (1) and higher rates of mortality in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease
(2, 3). Inflammatory factors released as part of the 'cytokine storm' are thought to play a
critical role in cardiac dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients (4). The cardiac sequelae
reported in patients with COVID-19, include acute coronary syndromes, cardiomyopathy,
acute pulmonary heart disease, arrhythmias and heart failure (5). There have been multiple
proposed aetiologies for these, yet clear mechanistic insight is lacking (5). There is a severe
inflammatory response in 5% of COVID-19 patients, associated with septic shock (2). This
leads to a drop in blood pressure, and approximately 30% of hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 require vasopressors to improve blood pressure (6). Furthermore, 68-78% have
sustained cardiac dysfunction, primarily right ventricle dysfunction and left ventricular
diastolic dysfunction (7, 8).
In severe infections, inflammation associated with a ‘cytokine storm’ can cause cardiac
dysfunction and pathology. COVID-19 induces a cytokine storm of similar magnitude to that
induced by CAR-T cell-associated cytokine storms (9). Additionally, the severe COVID-19 is
associated with sepsis and bacterial products in the serum (10), which are known drivers of
cardiac pathology and dysfunction. In the absence of infection, well known inflammatory
mediators such as TNF are associated with heart failure and have been demonstrated to
induce systolic dysfunction (11). Thus, inflammation could be a major primary mediator of
cardiac injury and dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, and would have further pathological
consequences including inadequate organ perfusion and immune cell infiltration, further
exacerbating disease. Thus, preventing cytokine-induced cardiac dysfunction may limit
severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients. However, targeted treatment strategies, particularly
in severe infections such as COVID-19, are currently lacking.
Several anti-inflammatory agents have shown clinical benefit for the acute management of
COVID-19. Dexamethasone improved 28-day mortality in COVID-19 patients receiving
invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen at randomization (12). Additionally, Janus kinase
(JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) (ruxolitinib and baricitinib) and
IL-6R inhibitors (tocilizumab and sarilumab) are currently in COVID-19 clinical trials.
However, systemic immunosuppression may impede viral clearance thus potentially
exacerbating disease (13). To circumvent this, we aimed to identify cardiac-specific
inflammatory targets that trigger cardiac dysfunction in response to the cytokine storm,
reasoning that these might provide a safe and effective therapeutic option.
Here, we utilize multi-cellular human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac organoids (hCO)
combined with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA-sequencing to identify therapeutic
targets and treatments for cardiac dysfunction. We recently adapted our hCO system (14,
15) to include co-culture with endothelial cells that form enhanced branched endothelial
structures surrounded by pericytes (Fig. S1), together with an optimized culture environment
that reflects a maturation stage; mimicking the postnatal metabolic environment (15)
followed by reversion to a more adult metabolic substrate provision (see Methods). This
platform enabled rapid screening of cytokine combinations that mimic the COVID-19-induced
‘cytokine storm’ and cardiac dysfunction, with subsequent application of omic assays and
drug screening (13).
Cytokine-induced cardiac dysfunction
We began by examining the effects of a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cardiac
function in our hCO (13, 16). Inflammatory molecules tested were TNF, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL17A, and G-CSF, as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns including poly(I:C) to
mimic dsRNA, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic TLR4 activation and septic responses.

Using RNA-seq (15, 17), we identified that the expression of the receptors IL1R1,
TNFRSF1A, TNFRSF1B, IFIH1, MYH88, IL6ST, IFNAR1, IL6R, TMEM173, IL17RA, IL17RB,
IL17RC, IL17RD, IL17RE, IFNGR1, TLR3, and TLR4 were at similar or higher levels in our
hCO compared to adult human heart (Fig. S2A). In adult mouse hearts many of these are
enriched in non-myocyte populations (18) (Fig. S2B). We used single nuclei RNA
sequencing (snRNA-seq) to assess cell specificity in our enhanced hCO (Voges et al., In
Revision). Mapping to human heart snRNA-seq (19) revealed the presence of proepicardial/epicardial cells, fibroblasts, activated fibroblasts/pericytes and cardiomyocytes
(Fig. S2C,D). Some cardiomyocytes were fetal-like, however there was a distinct sub-cluster
that mapped adjacent to adult ventricular cardiomyocytes from human hearts (20) (Fig.
S2E). The cytokine/pro-inflammatory receptors were expressed across different cell types,
but were enriched and more highly expressed in epicardial cells and fibroblasts (Fig. S2F)
(15, 17). We screened inflammatory factors in all pair-wise combinations in hCOs with
multiple functional measurements including contractile force, rate, activation kinetics and
relaxation kinetics (14, 15) (Fig. 1A). TNF caused a reduction in force, while IFN-γ, IL-1β,
poly(I:C) and LPS caused diastolic dysfunction characterized by a preserved contractile
force but prolonged time from peak to 50% relaxation (Fig. S3). A secondary full-factorial
screen of TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and poly(I:C), once again revealed that TNF induced systolic
dysfunction (Fig. 1B,D) with an EC50 of 1 ng/mL at 48 hours (Fig. S4A). A combination of
IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C) induced diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 1c,e), however also decreased
the beating rate which may influence the kinetics of contraction (Fig. S5, Supplementary
Video 1,2). Changes in rate were not responsible for increased relaxation time, as hCO
paced at 1 Hz retained the severe diastolic dysfunction phenotype (Fig. 1F, Supplementary
Video 3,4). Individually, IFN-γ and IL-1β caused concentration-dependent diastolic
dysfunction with a low EC50 of 0.8 ng/mL at 48 hours and 3 ng/mL at 24 hours, respectively,
while poly(I:C) was not able to induce dysfunction alone (Fig. S4B to D). These results were
confirmed in an independent cell line and overall the combination of IFN-γ, IL-1β and
poly(I:C) induced the most consistent, robust diastolic dysfunction (Fig. S6A to E). Taken
together this demonstrates that TNF induces systolic dysfunction consistent with previous in
vitro (21) and in vivo (22) studies and the combination of IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C) induces
severe diastolic dysfunction in hCO. The dominant factor identified causing diastolic
dysfunction, IFN-γ (Fig. S6C), is generally elevated in heart failure patients, but its role in
heart failure is contradictory in animal models with both detrimental and beneficial effects
reported (23).
Mechanisms driving cardiac cytokine storm-induced dysfunction
The most common cardiac dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is right ventricular
dysfunction or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (7). Therefore, we chose to interrogate the
mechanism of diastolic dysfunction induced by IFN-γ, IL-1β and poly(I:C), from here on
referred to as ‘cardiac cytokine storm’ (CS). Since protein phosphorylation is intimately
linked with all biological functions (24) we reasoned that measuring the global
phosphoproteome in hCO would provide an accurate fingerprint of the mechanistic targets of
the CS. Employing the latest developments of our phosphoproteomics technology (25, 26),
enabled identification of over 7,000 phosphosites in each sample, accurately pinpointing
7,927 phosphorylation sites to a single amino acid residue on around 3,000 different
phosphoproteins from single-run measurements of 20 organoids yielding < 100 µg of protein
each (Fig. 2A, Fig. S7). Preliminary studies using TNF identified several known biological
effects of this cytokine including decreased phosphorylation of protein kinase A and
increased phosphorylation of ADRK1 (also known as GRK2), supporting our approach.
Applying this technology to the CS treatment revealed 91 phosphosites that were
consistently elevated across three biological replicates (Fig. 2B). These sites were enriched

for terms relating to proliferation, with transcription factors over-represented with 35 sites
found on transcription factors or chromatin-binding proteins and 13 associated with the
biological process term ‘cell proliferation’ (FDR < 0.05, Fisher’s exact test). Among these
was phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) S727
(median 13.9 fold), as well as two sites on BRD4 (Bromodomain-containing protein 4) S469
and S1083 (median 7.4 and 12.3 fold respectively) (Fig 2B,C). In view of the availability of
specific small molecule inhibitors for each of these targets or their upstream regulators we
focused on these proteins in subsequent functional assays. The cytokine receptor
enrichment in non-myocytes (Fig. S2) and broad expression of key phosphorylation sites
such as BRD4 (Fig. 2B) suggests a multi-cellular response mediates cardiac dysfunction.
We assessed activation of individual cell populations in hCOs using snRNA-seq of ~40
pooled hCOs per condition (Fig. 3A) with mapping as described above (CTRL - Fig. S2C,D
and CS - Fig. S8A,B). In CS conditions there was an increase in fibroblast and activated
fibroblast number (Fig. 3B). Consistently, recently identified markers of fibroblast activation
(27) also increased, including MEOX1, SERPINE1 (also known as plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1 which induces clotting), TNC, VEGFC, and IL4R, (Fig. 3C,D). Fibroblast activation
is known to be widely associated with cardiac dysfunction, including in patients with diastolic
dysfunction (28).
Drugs for the prevention of cardiac dysfunction
We next screened drugs that could potentially prevent cardiac dysfunction under either TNFinduced systolic dysfunction or CS-driven diastolic dysfunction (Fig. 4A). TNF is known to
induce systolic dysfunction via GRK2 mediated repression of β-adrenergic receptor signaling
(21). The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, paroxetine hydrochloride, can inhibit GRK2
(29), but we found that it was toxic at effective in vitro concentrations (30) (Fig. S9A). GRK2
mediates receptor endocytosis (31), and baricitinib was recently identified as a potential
AAK1-mediated endocytosis inhibitor using machine learning (32). Baricitinib prevented
TNF-induced dysfunction in hCO (Fig. 4B and Fig. S9A,B). However, baricitinib was only
protective against TNF-induced systolic dysfunction when co-administered with TNF and
was not effective after 24 h TNF treatment (Fig. 4C), potentially because receptor
internalization had already occurred. Additionally, hCO did not recover quickly from TNFinduced systolic dysfunction after the removal of TNF (Fig. 4C) indicating that secondary
remodeling events may have occurred.
A key signature of diastolic dysfunction under CS conditions was elevated phosphorylation
of transcriptional regulators. STAT1-S727 (Fig. 2C) is associated with assembly into
chromatin and is required for STAT1 transcriptional and biological activity in response to
IFN-γ (33). The putative STAT1-S727 kinase is CDK8 (34), so we next tested two CDK8
inhibitors SEL120-34A (35) and BI-1347 (36) previously shown to reduce STAT1-S727
phosphorylation. We also tested baricitinib and ruxolitinib two inhibitors of the JAK/STAT
pathway. However, none of these compounds, nor a broader spectrum CDK inhibitor
flavopiridol, prevented the CS-induced diastolic dysfunction (Fig. S10), noting that flavipiridol
was toxic and reduced force and hence all kinetic parameters. Notably, SEL120-34A and BI1347 specifically attenuated the rate and activation time defects under CS conditions (Fig.
S10B,C,E,F), which we validated in additional experiments (Fig. S11A to D) and may still
have clinical utility in this setting.
We observed elevated phosphorylation of the epigenetic regulator BRD4 in our CS treated
hCO phosphoproteome. We have previously shown that BRD inhibitors reduce relaxation
time in immature hCO (14), so we next evaluated the BRD inhibitors INCB054329 (37), JQ-1
(38), and ABBV-744 (39). Strikingly, INCB054329 prevented CS-induced diastolic
dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D, Fig. S12) without affecting force or rate
(Fig. S10A to G, Supplementary Video 5). JQ-1 also showed improved diastolic function in
one hPSC line at the highest concentration (Fig. S10H), so an additional higher

concentration for both JQ-1 and ABBV-744 were tested. JQ-1 protected hCO against CSinduced diastolic dysfunction, although INCB054329 was the most efficacious (Fig.
S13A,B). ABBV-744 was not effective, possibly because it is also an androgen receptor
inhibitor, which causes diastolic dysfunction in human cardiomyocytes (40). INCB054329
restored diastolic function following 24 h of CS conditions (Fig. 4E). This is potentially
because CS-induced diastolic dysfunction is driven by the presence of the inflammatory
mediators, demonstrated by partial hCO recovery 24 h after removing CS factors (Fig. 4E).
In patients, all inflammatory factors may be present simultaneously, and we found that
INCB054329 could attenuate diastolic dysfunction with all four factors, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-1β,
and poly(I:C), present (Fig. S13C).
Diastolic dysfunction in hCO and human patients with heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) or COVID-19 is associated with fibrosis (28, 41) (Fig. 3), with BRD4 known
to activate extracellular matrix deposition by fibroblasts (42, 43). In addition to this potential
mechanism, chronic inflammation caused by obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and hypertension cause systemic inflammation which also drives
endothelial dysfunction and decreased nitric oxide (NO) availability (44). This causes iNOS
compensation in other cell types, which can cause nitrosylation stress and cardiac
dysfunction (45, 46). As BRD4 is broadly expressed in our hCO (Fig. 4F), BRD4 inhibition
may also protect against these changes. We found CS decreased NOS3 mRNA (also known
as eNOS) and induced NOS2 mRNA (also known as iNOS) ~40 fold in hCO, which in turn
could be fully prevented by BRD inhibition without rescue of eNOS (Fig. 4G).
We next assessed whether human serum from COVID-19 patients could induce dysfunction
in hCO (Fig. 4H). Interestingly, levels of acute cardiac damage (cardiac troponin I, CTNI)
and cardiac stress (brain natriuretic peptide, BNP) were elevated in ‘mild’ rather than severe
patients in our cohort (Fig. 4H). Using our platform we were able to demonstrate that hCO
function was dictated by factors present in the human serum, as patients receiving
noradrenaline as inotropic support elevated contractile force in our hCO (Fig. 4H). Human
COVID-19 patient serum with elevated CTNI and BNP caused diastolic dysfunction in hCO
(Fig. 4H). INCB054329 prevented diastolic dysfunction caused by serum with the highest
levels of CNTI and BNP, and had no effect on function in hCO treated with serum with the
lowest levels of CNTI and BNP (which did not induce dysfunction and was free from
inotropes) (Fig. 4I).
INCB054329 prevents death in a cytokine storm model
There are currently no reported animal models that recapitulate the cytokine storm following
SARS-CoV2 infection that has been observed in humans. We therefore tested the ability of
INCB054329 to prevent LPS-induced cytokine storm and lethality in vivo (Fig. 5A). LPS
induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β and IFN-γ, which were elevated in the
plasma (Fig. 5B) and induced in the heart (Fig. 5C). Treatment with INCB054329 blocked
the LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 5B,C). LPS induced a fibrotic
response in the heart including induction of Meox1 and Tnc but not Postn, consistent with
our data in hCO (Fig. 3), which was also blocked by INCB054329 (Fig. S14). Also,
consistent with data in hCO, LPS reduced eNos and induced iNos which was blocked by
INCB054329 without rescue of eNos (Fig. 5D). Nppb was also reduced, consistent with a
reduction in LPS-induced cardiac stress (Fig. 5E). We observed a marked improvement in
mortality, whereby all INCB054329-treated mice survived after 24 h of the LPS-challenge,
compared with only 25% in the control group (Fig. 5F). INCB054329 therefore has potent
and robust effects on improving of cardiac pathological markers and cytokine storm-induced
mortality.
INCB054329 protects against SARS-CoV2 infection

SARS-CoV2 can infect human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CM)
(47). We tested whether BRD inhibition would potentially exacerbate infection/death (Fig.
6A). We confirmed these findings and show that infection of 2D cultured hPSC-CM
increases over time (Fig. S15A), dsRNA is present in infected hPSC-CM (Fig. S15B) and
there is live viral replication in infected hPSC-CM (Fig. S15C). Increasing viral titres
increased cell death (Fig. S15D) and even low titres resulted in intracellular viral infection
and death over 7 days (Fig. S15D,E). Low titres of 0.01 MOI could infect mature hCO,
demonstrating that this was not due to hPSC-CM immaturity (Fig. S15F). However, hCO
infection was ~100 fold lower than 2D culture and there were no gross effects on sarcomere
organisation in the hCO (Fig. S15F,G), indicating localized infection. We therefore chose to
assess the effects of BRD inhibition on viral replication in 2D hPSC-CM (Fig. 6A). Treatment
with INCB054329 at the time of infection did not change viral load or replication (Fig.
S15H,I,J). As patients may receive BRD inhibitors prior to infection of the heart, we also
assessed the impact of a treatment combined with 3 day pre-incubation of INCB054329.
This resulted in a >4 fold decrease in viral load (Fig. 6B), potentially via decreased ACE2
expression (Fig. 6C). Treatment with INCB054329 also prevented cardiomyocyte sarcomere
loss caused by infection (Fig. 6D,E) and drastically reduced the presence of infected cells
Fig. S15K). This indicates that pre-treatment with BRD inhibitors confers some protection of
the heart to SARS-CoV2 infection, making them very promising therapeutics for the
prevention of cardiac injury and dysfunction for patients with COVID-19.

DISCUSSION
Cardiac dysfunction may be caused by systemic cytokine storm (9) or locally induced
cardiac viral toxicity or cytokine production (48). In this study we show that inflammatory
mediators directly impact cardiac function in hCO, a model free from the secondary effects
and neurohormonal compensation present in vivo. We find that a combination of classical
viral response cytokines IFN-γ and IL-1β, combined with dsRNA – ‘CS’ - cause severe
diastolic dysfunction with 20-50% increases in relaxation time without decline in systolic
function. This is consistent with clinical data from HFpEF patients, where cardiomyocytes
have increased time to 50% relaxation by ~13-18% (with similar overall values of 100-150
ms in both humans and hCO) (49). A reason why cardiovascular risk factors for HFpEF are
also risk factors for mortality in COVID-19 patients, may be that the underlying chronic
inflammation and cardiac dysfunction becomes further exacerbated by the acute,
inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19. Prolonged relaxation also increases the
risk of arrhythmias, which have been widely reported in COVID-19 patients (50). Arrhythmic
events increased in CS conditions across our 7 experiments, for which INCB054329 also
conferred protection (Fig. S16A to C).
By performing high-sensitivity phsophoproteomics and drug screening with our optimized
hCO platform we identify a therapeutically targetable inflammation-BRD4 -fibrosis/iNOS axis.
This acts as a key intracellular mediator of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction, which
functions independently of JAK/STAT. BRD4 inhibition reduced inflammatory cytokine
production, fibroblast activation, and compensatory iNOS production, all of which drive
cardiac dysfunction.
Previously, the BRD inhibitor GSK525762A has shown efficacy in mouse cytokine storm
models (51) and JQ-1 has shown efficacy in small animal cardiac injury models (52).
However, in our studies INCB054329 was far more potent than JQ-1, and ABBV-744 had no
efficacy in improving CS induced dysfunction. This indicates that BRD inhibitors need to be
carefully selected for cardiac efficacy, despite their broad utility for a variety of clinical
conditions (53).
We demonstrate that BRD inhibitors are powerful drugs to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and
prevent cardiac infection. Additionally, we also show anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic
effects, which may have benefits in multiple organs affected by COVID-19 including the
lungs (43). Taken together, the efficacy and known safety profile of BRD inhibitors make
them prime candidates for drug repurposing for COVID-19 to improve morbidity and
mortality.
