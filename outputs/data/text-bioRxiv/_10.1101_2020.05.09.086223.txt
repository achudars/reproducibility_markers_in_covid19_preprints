Background. After its emergence in China in December 2019, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

40

caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread infecting more than 3 million people worldwide. South America

41

is among the last regions hit by COVID-19 pandemic. In Uruguay, first cases were detected on March 13 th

42

2020 presumably imported by travelers returning from Europe.

43

Methods. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the

44

first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology

45

using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

46

Results. Our phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from

47

different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain.

48

Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20 th. Identification of specific

49

mutations showed rapid local genetic differentiation.

50

Conclusions. We evidenced early independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 that likely occurred before first

51

cases were detected. Our analysis set the bases for future genomic epidemiology studies to understand the

52

dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay and the Latin America and the Caribbean region.

Introduction

78
79

In December 2019, a new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was detected in Wuhan, China. Its

80

causative agent, known as SARS-CoV-2, has spread rapidly causing a global pandemic of pneumonia

81

affecting more than 3M people with more than 200,000 deaths to date [1]. Global spread of SARS-CoV-2

82

was primarily driven by international movement of people, since travel-associated cases of COVID-19 were

83

reported outside of China as early as mid-January 2020 [2]. This global health emergency has deployed

84

international efforts to apply genomic epidemiology to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in real time. The

85

recent development of targeted sequencing protocols by the ARTIC Network [3], open sharing of genomic

86

data through the GISAID (www.gisaid.org) database and straightforward bioinformatic tools for viral

87

phylogenomics [4], provides the opportunity to reconstruct global spatio-temporal dynamics of the COVID-

88

19 pandemic with unprecedented comprehensiveness and resolution.

89

South America was one of the last regions in the world to be hit by COVID-19. Indeed, first cases

90

were confirmed in Brazil around 2 months after its emergence in China. Then, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly emerged

91

in neighboring countries like Uruguay, that reported first cases in Montevideo, its capital city, on March 13 th.

92

Population of Uruguay is among the smallest in South America (~3.5M), and is mainly concentrated in

93

Montevideo and its metropolitan area (~56% of the total population). Also, the biggest international airport

94

of the country is placed in this metropolitan area and concentrates more than 90% of international arrivals.

95

These characteristics makes Montevideo a suitable place to apply genomic surveillance to uncover

96

epidemiological patterns during the early phase of the COVID-19 local outbreak in Uruguay. We therefore

97

aimed to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by sequencing around 10% of cases

98

occurred during the first week of outbreak in Montevideo, allowing us to identify transmission patterns,

99

geographic origins and genetic variation among local strains.

100
101

Methods

102
103

Ethics statement. Residual de-identified nasopharyngeal samples were remitted to the Institut Pasteur

104

Montevideo, that has been validated by the Ministry of Health of Uruguay as an approved center providing

105

diagnostic testing for COVID-19. All samples were de-identified before receipt by the study investigators.

106
107

Sample collection, processing and sequencing. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from patients residing

108

in Montevideo. No other location data was available to researchers to avoid patient identification. Swabs

109

were placed in virus transport media (BD Universal Viral Transport Medium) immediately after collection.

110

Total RNA extraction was performed directly from samples (500 μL) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life

111

Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). An in-house OneStep RT-qPCR assay based on TaqMan probes targeting

112

the N gene and the Open Reading Frame 1b region were used to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

113

We selected a total of 10 positive samples with cycle-threshold (CT) less than 30 for downstream whole-

114

genome sequencing.

115

Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples was performed according to the primalseq [5]

116

approach on the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom) using the

117

V2 primer pools. Sequencing libraries were prepared based on the PCR tiling of COVID-19 virus protocol

118

(ARTIC Network) using the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109) and Native Barcoding Expansion

119

(EXP-NBD114) (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, United Kingdom), with the following modifications: i)

120

RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies,

121

Carlsbad, CA, USA) and random hexamer primers following the manufacturer’s instructions, ii) Phusion Hot

122

Start II High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific) was used for PCR amplification and, iii)

123

Blunt/TA ligase (New England Biolabs, USA) was used to ligate barcodes to each sample. To detect cross-

124

contamination between samples, a no template sample was added from a patient tested negative for SARS-

125

CoV-2 from the RNA purification step.

126

A total of 15 ng of pooled samples was loaded onto a MinION R9.4.1 flow cell and sequenced for 5

127

hours generating ~2 million reads of average quality of 12. The RAMPART software from the ARTIC

128

Network (https://github.com/artic-network/rampart) was used to monitor the sequencing run in real time,

129

estimate coverage across samples and check barcoding. Subsequently, basecalling was performed Guppy

130

software v3.2.1 using the high accuracy module. Consensus genomes were generated and variants were

131

called using the ARTIC Network bioinformatic pipeline (https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-

132

bioinformatic.sop.html). Amplicons that were not sequenced or whose depth was less than 20x were not

133

included in the consensus sequences and these positions were represented by “N” stretches. See

134

Supplementary Table S1.

135
136

Phylogenetic and spatio-temporal analysis. To investigate the origin, dynamics and genetic variation of

137

SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay, we added our 10 genomes to a dataset of 2,443 complete (>29,000 bp.), high-

138

quality genomes available from GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) on April 2nd 2020. A list of sequences and

139

acknowledgements to the originating and submitting labs is presented in Supplementary Table S2. We

140

analyzed this dataset using the augur toolkit version 6.4.2 [3]. Briefly, genomes were aligned using MAFFT

141

[6] and a phylogeny was reconstructed with IQ-TREE [7]. Estimation of ancestral divergence times and

142

geographic locations for internal nodes of the tree, and identification of branch-specific or clade-defining

143

mutations were obtained using augur and TreeTime [8]. Code for performing these analyses can be found at

144

Results

148
149

Multiple international introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Uruguay. To investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2

150

in Uruguay we whole-genome sequenced 10 cases diagnosed with COVID-19 in Montevideo between March

151

16th to 19th. This is within the first week after the presence of the virus was reported in Uruguay in March 13 th

152

by the national authorities (Fig. 1). These cases represented 10.6% of accumulated cases (10 out of 94)

153

reported in Montevideo by March 19 th. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that genomes sequenced from

154

cases reported in Uruguay were placed in three distinct clusters. Genome UY-10 (hereinafter referred as

155

cluster C1-UY) was embedded within clade A1a. Two other viral genomes, UY-7 and UY-8 (hereinafter

156

referred as cluster C2-UY) were related each other and placed within clade B1. The remaining 7 viral

157

genomes (hereinafter referred as cluster C3-UY) were related each other and were placed within clade B

158

(Fig. 2). These clusters were supported by specific, non-homoplasic mutations (Table 1). Together, these

159

results indicate three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Uruguay.

160
161

Early SARS-CoV-2 circulation and regional spread. To uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-

162

CoV-2 in Uruguay, we performed a phylogeographic reconstruction. The most probable ancestral location for

163

C1-UY was Australia, however, very similar viruses have been also sequenced from the United Kingdom

164

(Fig. 3). The last common ancestor of C1-UY in Australia dated back to Mar 5 th (Confidence Interval (CI):

165

Feb 28th - Mar 13rd). C2-UY was embedded in a cluster of viruses sequenced in Canada, the United States,

166

Australia and Iceland whose emergence dated back to February 28 th (CI: Feb 25th - Mar 4th) (Fig. 4). C3-UY

167

likely originated from European viruses circulating in Spain since Jan 21 th (CI: Jan 7th - Feb 5th). The last

168

common ancestor of C3-UY in Uruguay was tracked to Mar 4 th (CI: Feb 23rd - Mar 11th) (Fig. 5). Two viruses

169

from Chile were intermingled between viruses from Spain and Uruguay, indicating regional circulation of

170

these variants. Together, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 could be circulating in the country previous

171

to its first detection in Mar 13th.

172
173

Local clusters and genetic differentiation. To further characterize Uruguayan SARS-CoV-2, we identified

174

genetic differences among genomes. C1-UY ancestor likely located in Australia presented one non-

175

synonymous mutation C3096T which affected the ORF1ab protein (S955L) and genome UY-10 harbored

176

one additional synonymous mutation A29731G. C2-UY ancestor likely located in Canada was characterized

177

by one synonymous mutation A24694T and the last common ancestor to UY-7 and UY-8 presented another

178

synonymous change A11782G. Additionally, genome UY-8 presented one synonymous mutation C17470T.

179

C3-UY and Chilean genomes displayed one synonymous mutations C17470T which distinguished them from

180

the original Spanish lineage. Additionally, C3-UY differentiated from Chilean genomes by one synonymous

181

mutation C25521T. Specifically, among C3-UY genome UY-5 presented a single synonymous mutation

182

C6310T and genome UY-6 presented one non-synonymous mutation C7635A in the ORF1ab protein

183

(T2457K). Overall, we observed mutations within Uruguayan clusters supporting rapid local differentiation

184

(Table 2).

185
186

Discussion

187
188

Using portable, low-cost sequencing approaches based on the MinION platform (Oxford Nanopore

189

Technologies) we were able to generate whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 just 24 hours after

190

receiving the samples in the lab. This allowed us to determine the most plausible spatio-temporal scenario

191

during the first week since COVID-19 was detected in Uruguay. Consequently, we show that real-time

192

molecular epidemiology responses can be implemented locally as previously done by other countries [9].

193

Our results uncovered SARS-CoV-2 genomes derived from three independent international origins

194

as early as 3 days after the disease was reported in Uruguay. International air transport has likely played a

195

central role in the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to the current COVID-19 pandemic. According

196

to air transport statistics from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org) and the National Government

197

(www.dinacia.gub.uy), Uruguayan airports received ~2.2M passengers in 2018 ranking 12 th within the Latin

198

America and the Caribbean region. This highlights that even for countries with comparatively low air traffic,

199

multiple international introductions of SARS-CoV-2 have played an important role in the establishment of

200

local outbreaks.

201

We estimated these introductions could have occurred as early as mid-February, around 1 month

202

before first cases were reported in Uruguay in March 13 th. This is in line with observations from other

203

geographic regions, for example, in New York first cases were confirmed in March but a recent study

204

suggested that initial virus introductions could be traced back to February 20 th [10]. Also, the virus was likely

205

introduced in Europe by a traveler that arrived from Wuhan to France, but the recent identification of a group

206

of ill Chinese tourists in France previous to this case supports earlier introductions [11]. Indeed, SARS-CoV-

207

2 has been proposed to circulate in humans even before its first detection in December 2019 [12].

208

Together, our results highlight the importance of active genomic surveillance during the ongoing

209

COVID-19 pandemic to guide informed decisions, based on assessing the epidemiological behavior of

210

SARS-CoV-2 in real time. The application of rapid genomic epidemiology during local outbreaks allows to

211

identify main routes of virus introduction and estimate spatio-temporal dynamics which can be used to

212

improve contingency measures. Remarkably, tracking the emergence of local genetic variants like those we

213

observed in Montevideo, is important to evaluate the sensibility of molecular diagnosis and potential impacts

214

on future anti-viral strategies. Subsequent generation of a more comprehensive genomic dataset from the

215

ongoing outbreak in Uruguay will allow us to identify domestic transmission patterns and spatio-temporal

216

characterization of local clusters. Additionally, setting up coordinated efforts to generate genomic data in

217

South America will allow us to perform integrative analyses to uncover SARS-CoV-2 dynamics at the

218

continental level.
