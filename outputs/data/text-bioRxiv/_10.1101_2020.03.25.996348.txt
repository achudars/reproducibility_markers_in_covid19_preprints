ABSTRACT:
SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak in
Wuhan. Specific antiviral drug are urgently needed to treat COVID-19 infections. The
main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a key CoV enzyme that plays a pivotal role in
mediating viral replication and transcription, which makes it an attractive drug target.
In an effort to rapidly discover lead compounds targeting Mpro, two compounds (11a
and 11b) were designed and synthesized, both of which exhibited excellent inhibitory
activity with an IC50 value of 0.05 μM and 0.04 μM respectively. Significantly, both
compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay
with an EC50 value of 0.42 μM and 0.33 μM, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures
of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 Å
resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are
covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of
Mpro. Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low
toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further
studies.

Introduction:
In late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel
coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, China1,2,3. Genomic sequencing showed that this
pathogenic coronavirus is 96.2% identical to a bat coronavirus and shares 79.5%

sequence identify to SARS-CoV4,5,6. This novel coronavirus was named as severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the pneumonia was designated as
COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 20207. The
epidemic spread rapidly to all provinces of China and to more than 159 countries and
was announced as a global health emergency by WHO8. To make matters worse, no
clinically effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs are currently available for the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. The combination of α-interferon
and the anti-HIV drugs Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra®) is the current clinical
treatment strategy, but the curative effect remains very limited and toxic side effects
cannot be ignored. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by Gilead
Sciences, Inc., is the clinical drug under development for the treatment of new
coronavirus pneumonia, but more data are needed to prove its efficacy to treat
COVID-199,10,11. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with efficiency and safety are
urgently needed.
A maximum likelihood tree based on the genomic sequence showed that the
virus falls within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus6.
Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that lack
the ability to correct errors occurring during RNA replication. This property results in
high variability of CoVs and mutations that occur frequently and quickly under
environmental and evolutionary stress. Therefore, RNA CoVs are highly prevalent
and severe pathogens of viral diseases12. The genomic RNA of CoVs is approximately
30 k nt in length with a 5’-cap structure and 3’-poly-A tail, which has the largest viral
RNA genome known to date and contains at least 6 open reading frames (ORFs).
There is an a-1 frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b which are the first ORF, about
two-third of genome length, directly translating polyprotein (pp) 1a/1ab. These
polyproteins will be processed by a 3C-like protease (3CLpro), also named as the main
protease (Mpro), and one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs) into 16 non-structural
proteins (nsps). Subsequently, these nsps catalyze the synthesis of a nested set of
subgenomic RNAs which are used as templates to directly translate main structural

proteins including envelope (E), membrane (M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N)
proteins. Therefore, these proteases, especially 3CLpro, play a vital role in the life
cycle of coronavirus13,14,15,16.
3CLpro (Mpro) is a three-domain (domains I to III) cysteine protease and involves
in most maturation cleavage events within the precursor polyprotein. Active 3CLpro is
a homodimer containing two protomers. The CoV 3CLpro features a non-canonical
Cys...His dyad located in the cleft between domains I and II17,18,19. Several common
features are shared among the substrates of CoVs 3CLpro, and especially a Gln residue
is almost absolutely required for the substrate in the P1 position. 3CLpro is conserved
within the group of CoVs. In addition, there is no human homologue of 3CLpro which
makes it an ideal antiviral target20,21.
Design and synthesis of a series of peptidomimetic aldehydes as coronavirus 3CL
protease inhibitors
The substrates of coronaviruses 3CLpro (Mpro) show some similarity, and most
3CL protease inhibitors are peptidomimetic covalent inhibitors derived from the
natural substrates. The active sites are highly conserved among all CoV Mpro and are
usually composed of four pockets (S1’, S1, S2 and S4) 22,23. The thiol of a cysteine
residue in the S1’ pocket can anchor inhibitors by a covalent linkage, which is
important for the inhibitors to maintain anti-viral activity. In our design of new
inhibitors, the aldehyde was selected as a new warhead in P1’ to occupy the S1’pocket.
As the (S)-γ-lactam ring has been proved to be suitable in the S1 pocket of 3Cpro and
3CLpro, this ring was expected to be a good choice in P1 of new inhibitors.
Furthermore, the S2 pocket of coronavirus 3CLpro is usually large enough to
accommodate the bigger P2 fragment. To assess the possibility of π-π stacking
interactions and hydrophobic interaction with the S2 pocket, the aryl and cyclohexyl
group were placed in P2 (compounds 11a and 11b). Finally, the indole or other
heterocyclice groups, which are privileged skeletons, were introduced into P3 in order
to form new hydrogen bonds with S4 and improve drug-like properties.
Synthetic procedures: The synthetic route and chemical structures of the
compounds (11a and 11b) are shown in Scheme 1. The starting material 1 was

obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification to
synthesize the key intermediate 3 according to the literature24. The intermediates 6a
and 6b were synthesized from 4 and acid 5a, 5b. After the t-butoxycarbonyl group
was removed from 6a and 6b, the intermediates 7a and 7b were obtained. Coupling
compounds 7a and 7b with the acid 8 yielded the esters 9a, 9b. The peptidomimetic
aldehydes 11a and 11b were approached via a two-step route in which the ester
derivatives 9 were first reduced with NaBH4 to generate the primary alcohols 10a and
10b, which were subsequently oxidized into aldehydes 11a and 11b with Dess-Martin
Periodinane (DMP).

assay.
Encouragingly, both compounds 11a and 11b exhibited high SARS-CoV-2
3CLpro inhibition activity, which reached 100.4% for 11a and 96.3% for 11b at 1 μM,
respectively. Further experiments were conducted by a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET)-based cleavage assay to determine the IC50s. The results revealed
excellent inhibitory potency with an IC50 value of 0.053 ± 0.005 μM and 0.040 ±
0.002 μM, respectively.

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11a
In order to elucidate the mechanism of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by 11a, we
determined the high-resolution crystal structure of this complex at 1.5-Å resolution
(Table S1)18,26,27. The crystals of Mpro-11a belongs to the space group C2 and each

asymmetric unit contains only one molecule (Table S1). By a crystallographic 2-fold
symmetry axis, two molecules (designated protomer A and protomer B) associate into
a homodimer (Figure S2). The structure of each protomer contains three domains and
the substrate-binding site is located in the cleft between domain I and II (Figure S2).
At the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, Cys145 and His41 (Cys-His) form a catalytic
dyad (Figure S2).
The electron density map clearly showed the compound 11a in the substrate
binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in an extended conformation (Figure 2A and
S3A). To facilitate the explanation of the binding mode of 11a, we will introduce it
according to the chemical skeleton of this compound (P1′: aldehyde group; P1: (S)-

γ-lactam ring; P2: cyclohexyl; P3: indole group). The electron density showed that the
C of the aldehyde group of 11a and the catalytic site Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
form a standard 1.8 Å C–S covalent bond (Figure 2B), which suggests a Michael
addition reaction. Furthermore, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde group also plays a
crucial role for stabilizing the conformations of the inhibitor by forming hydrogen
bonds with backbone of residues Cys145 and Gly143 in the S1′ site (Figure 2B). The
(S)-γ-lactam ring of 11a at P1 favorably inserts into the S1 site (Figure 2B). The
oxygen of the (S)-γ-lactam group interacts with the side chain of His163 by hydrogen
bond. The main chain of Phe140 and side chain of Glu166 also participate in
stabilizing the (S)-γ-lactam ring by forming hydrogen bonds with the NH group. In
addition, the amide bonds on the chain of 11a are hydrogen-bonded with the main
chains of His164 and Glu166, respectively (Figure 2B). The cyclohexyl moiety of

11a at P2 enters deep into the S2 site, stacking to the imidazole ring of His41 (Figure
2B). The cyclohexyl group is also surrounded by the side chains of Met49, Tyr54,
Met165 and Asp187, producing extensive hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2B). The
indole group of 11a at P3 is exposed to solvent (S4 site) and is stabilized by Glu166
through a hydrogen bond (Figure 2B). The side chains of residues Pro168 and
Gln189 interact with the indole group of 11a through hydrophobic interactions.
Interestingly, multiple water molecules (named W1-W6) play an important role in
binding 11a (Figure 2B). W1 interacts with the amide bonds of 11a through a
hydrogen bond, whereas W2-6 form a number of hydrogen bonds with the aldehyde
group of 11a and the residues of Asn142, Gly143, Thr26, Thr25, His41 and Cys44,
which contributes to stabilize 11a in the binding pocket (Figure 2B).

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11b

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with 11b is very similar to
that of the 11a complex and shows a similar inhibitor binding mode (Figure 2C, 2D,
S3B and S3C). The difference in binding is probably due to the aryl group of 11b at
P2. Compared with the cyclohexyl group in 11a, the aryl group undergoes a
significant rotation (Figure 2C). The side chains of residues His41, Met49, Met165
and Val186 interact with this aryl group through hydrophobic interactions (Figure
2D). The side chain of Gln189 stabilizes the aryl group with an additional hydrogen
bond (Figure 2D). In short, these two crystal structures reveal an identical inhibitory
mechanism in that these two compounds occupy the substrate-binding pocket,
mimicking the intermediates in the catalytic reaction, which blocks the enzyme
activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Antiviral activity assay
To further substantiate the enzyme inhibition results, we evaluated the ability of
these compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) were
treated with a series of concentrations of the two compounds, and then were infected
with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019) at
a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05. At 24 hours post infection (h p.i.), viral copy
numbers in the cell supernatant were quantified using quantitative real time PCR
(RT-PCR). The cytotoxicity of these compounds in Vero E6 cells was also determined
by using Cell Counting kit 8 (CCK8) assays. As shown in Figure 3, compounds 11a
and 11b exhibited good anti- SARS-CoV-2-infection activity in cell culture with an

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.996348; this version posted March 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

EC50 values of 0.42 ± 0.08 μM and 0.33 ± 0.09 μM, respectively. Neither compound
caused significant cytotoxicity, with half cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values
of >100 μM, yielding a selectivity index (SI) of 11a and 11b of >238 and >303,
respectively. Thus, 11a and 11b exhibit a very good antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 3. In vitro inhibition of viral 3CL protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2
Vero E6 cells were treated with a series concentration of indicated compounds 11a
and 11b and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.05. At 24 hours post infection,
cell supernatants were collected and the viral yield in the cell supernatant was
quantified by qRT-PCR. The cytotoxicity of these compounds in Vero E6 cells was
also determined by using CCK8 assays. The left and right Y-axis of the graphs
represent mean % inhibition of virus yield and mean % cytotoxicity of the drugs,
respectively.

Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of 11a and 11b.
To explore the further druggability of the compounds 11a and 11b, both of two
compounds were evaluated for its pharmacokinetic properties. As shown in Table S2,
compound 11a given intraperitoneally (5mg/kg) and intravenous (5mg/kg) displayed a
long half-life (T1/2) of 4.27 h and 4.41h, a high maximal concentration (Cmax=2394

ng/mL), and a good bioavailability of 87.8%. Metabolic stability of 13a in mice was
also good (CL = 17.4 mL/min/mg). When administered intraperitoneal (20mg/kg),
subcutaneous (5mg/kg) and intravenous (5mg/kg), compound 11b also showed good
PK properties. Considering the danger of COVID-19, we selected the intravenous drip
administration to further study. Compared with 11a administrated via intravenous, the
half-life (1.65h) of 11b is shorter and the clearance rate is faster (CL = 20.6
mL/min/mg). Compound 11a was selected for further investigation with intravenous
drip dosing on rats and dogs. The results showed (Table S3) that 11a exhibited long
T1/2 (rat, 7.6 h and dog, 5.5h), low clearance rate (rat, 4.01 mL/min/kg and dogs, 5.8
mL/min/kg) and high AUC value (rat, 41500 h*ng/mL and dog, 14900 h*ng/mL)).
Those results indicating that compound 11a has good PK properties to warrant further
study.
In vivo toxicity evaluation of 11a.
The in vivo toxicity study (Table S4) of 11a have been carried out on SD rats and
Beagle dogs. The acute toxicity of 11a was conducted on SD rats, and no SD rats died
after receiving 40 mg/kg via intravenous drip administration. When the dosage was
raised to 60 mg/kg, one of four SD rats was died. The dose range toxicity study of 11a
was conducted for seven days in the dosing level at 2, 6, 18 mg/kg on SD rats and at
10-40 mg/kg on Beagle dogs, once daily dosing (QD), by intravenous drip, all animals
were clinically observed once a day at least and no obvious toxicity was observed in
each group. The results show 11a with low toxicity on rats and dogs.

New infectious agents have emerged to cause epidemics, such as SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. In order to identify antivirals to contain CoV
infection, novel peptidomimetic aldehyde derivatives were designed, synthesized and
evaluated biologically for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) activity and
anti-SARS-CoV-2-infection activity in cell-based assays. Compounds 11a and 11b
exhibited excellent anti-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity (IC50 = 0.053 ± 0.005 μM and
IC50 = 0.040 ± 0.002 μM respectively) and good anti-SARS-CoV-2-infection activity
in cell culture (EC50 = 0.42 ± 0.08 μM and EC50 = 0.33 ± 0.09 μM respectively). The
crystal structures have shown that these drug leads can bind to the substrate-binding
pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, revealing the detailed covalent inhibition at the active
site of the enzyme. Therefore, the class of peptidomimetic inhibitor carrying
aldehydes has demonstrated potent inhibition both on the viral protease in the
biochemical level and viral replication in the cell-based assays. Both compounds
showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is
promising compounds for heading to the clinical study.
