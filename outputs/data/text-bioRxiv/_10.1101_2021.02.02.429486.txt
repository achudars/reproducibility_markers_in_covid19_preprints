Abstract
Understanding SARS-CoV-2 evolution is a fundamental effort in coping with the COVID-19
pandemic. The virus genomes have been broadly evolving due to the high number of
infected hosts world-wide. Mutagenesis and selection are the two inter-dependent
mechanisms of virus diversification. However, which mechanisms contribute to the mutation
profiles of SARS-CoV-2 remain under-explored. Here, we delineate the contribution of
mutagenesis and selection to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We generated a
comprehensive phylogenetic tree with representative genomes. Instead of counting
mutations relative to the reference genome, we identified each mutation event at the nodes
of the phylogenetic tree. With this approach, we obtained the mutation events that are
independent of each other and generated the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The
results suggest that the heterogeneous mutation patterns are mainly reflections of host (i)
antiviral mechanisms that are achieved through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins and (ii)
probable adaptation against reactive oxygen species.

Importance
SARS-CoV-2 genomes are evolving worldwide. Revealing the evolutionary characteristics of
SARS-CoV-2 is essential to understand host-virus interactions. Here, we aim to understand
whether mutagenesis or selection is the primary driver of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This study
provides an unbiased computational method for profiling and analyzing independently
occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The results point out three host antiviral mechanisms
shaping the mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 through APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP proteins.
Besides, reactive oxygen species might have an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide
since its emergence in December 2019 (Hu, Guo, Zhou, & Shi, 2020), reportedly infected
more than 83 million people with a death toll of 1,831,412 as of 4 January 2021, according to
World Health Organization (WHO) (https://covid19.who.int/). Studies have been focused on
effective treatment of the disease, mostly by the drug re-purposing approach due to the
urgency (Shah, Modi, & Sagar, 2020) and by finding a vaccine that will stop the spreading of
the virus. Though there are dozens of vaccine candidates in clinical development, the
evolutionary potential of the virus might affect the efficacy of the immunizations and
treatments. Therefore, understanding the genomic features and mutation dynamics of the
virus is crucial to interpret its evolutionary patterns and its response to the available
treatments and potential vaccines.
Analyzing virus sequence context and mutations has revealed many critical pieces of
information about the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. For example, the origin of SARS-CoV2 was linked to bats and pangolins using phylogenetic analyses (Li, Yang, & Ren, 2020; Wu
et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Through mutational analyses, some
genomic variants of the virus were associated with increased transmissibility (Hou et al.,
2020; Volz et al., 2020). In addition, we and others studied the spread of the virus in a variety
of countries by tracking the mutation events of sequences over time (Adebali et al., 2020;
Popa et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020).
Some studies also analyzed the mutation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 by counting the mutations
on sequences (Graudenzi, Maspero, Angaroni, Piazza, & Ramazzotti, 2020; Popa et al.,
2020). Care should be taken when counting mutations to create a mutation profile.
Considering that virus genomes are evolutionarily linked to each other, counting all the
mutations in the sequences with respect to a reference genome creates a mutation bias
towards the most abundant or frequently sequenced isolates. In other words, if a mutation
occurs in an ancestral genome, it will also be seen in all of its descendants unless it reverts.
When the mutations are called relative to a reference genome, variants of a common origin
will be counted multiple times, even though they are linked to a single mutation event. To
overcome this issue, we created a phylogenetic tree and assigned only nucleotides that differ
from the parent node as a mutation.

In this study, we retrieved more than 65,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID
(Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) database (Shu & McCauley, 2017) and
clustered them based on their sequence identity. For each cluster, we assigned a sequence
as the representative of its cluster. We aligned the representatives, and constructed a
phylogenetic tree using a maximum likelihood method. Then, we assigned mutations to the
nodes of the phylogenetic tree and counted only the mutations on sequences that were
newly acquired with respect to its parent node. Finally, we analyzed mutation profiles and
sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2.

Results
We retrieved 66,938 genomes, which were all the available genomes in the GISAID
database as of July 18th, 2020 (Shu & McCauley, 2017). Because multiple sequence
alignment and building a tree with more than 65,000 genomes was computationally intense,
we initially clustered the genomes and assigned a sequence from each cluster as its
representative. By the method, we reduced the genome number to 20,089 without losing
major sequence information. To assign mutations, we first aligned the 20,089 representative
sequences and built a phylogenetic tree with a maximum likelihood method (see Methods).
Then, we reconstructed the phylogenetic tree into a time-resolved phylogenetic tree, which
infers the ancestral characters by estimating the molecular clock of the viral genomes
(Sagulenko, Puller, & Neher, 2018). After constructing the tree, mutations were assigned
based on the differences between the sequences and their parent node (Figure 1). This
method enabled us to capture all the mutation events without recounting ancestral mutations.
Moreover, we could also identify mutations that occurred repeatedly in different lineages,
which would not be possible if the mutations were assigned relative to a reference genome.

Mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially related mechanisms
To generate the mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2, we performed mutational signature
analysis for all 192 trinucleotide changes using 28,544 mutations from the 35,841
representative sequences and nodes (Figure 2A). We normalized all the trinucleotide
changes by the occurrence of the trinucleotide to eliminate any sequence context bias. In
general, the most abundant mutational patterns are C>U, G>U, U>C, and A>G substitutions,
that are 33.8%, 14.8%, 13.7%, and 9.6% of total substitutions, respectively (Figure 2A).
An enzyme family known for causing C>U substitution is called apolipoprotein B mRNA
editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) family. Enzymes of APOBEC family
have an antiviral activity against some RNA viruses including coronaviruses (Harris &
Dudley, 2015; Sharma et al., 2015; Woo, Wong, Huang, Lau, & Yuen, 2007). Briefly, they
can deaminate cytosine to thymine (uracil in the RNA genome), which can either result in
C>U substitution on single-stranded viral RNA (plus strand) or G>A substitution if the
mutation occurs on complementary strand (minus strand). In agreement with previous
studies, the impact of APOBEC is highly visible at C>U substitutions, while it is relatively low
at G>A substitutions (8.8% of total substitutions) (Di Giorgio, Martignano, Torcia, Mattiuz, &
Conticello, 2020; Graudenzi et al., 2020; Simmonds, 2020). This result suggests an
asymmetric activity for APOBEC enzymes in favor of single-stranded viral RNA. Because

virus RNA is frequently present as the plus strand, we see the effect of the APOBEC activity
majorly in the form of C>U substitution relative to G>A, which possibly reflects APOBEC
activity on the negative strand during RNA replication. Moreover, APOBEC proteins show
target inclination towards 5’-[T/U]C-3’ and 5’–CC–3’ motifs while deamination of cytosine
(McDaniel et al., 2020). Target sequence preferences of APOBEC proteins are observed in
our mutational profile, where the 5 out of 7 highest normalized mutational counts on C>U
distributes along 5’-UC-3′ and 5’–CC–3’ motifs (Figure 2A). It is also experimentally found
that A1CF RNA editing cofactor, which is APOBEC1 complementation factor, is among the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA binders (Schmidt et al., 2020) that strengthens the hypothesis of
APOBEC proteins' activity on the C>U substitutions.
The second most prevalent substitution is G>U, which might be associated with reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in APOBEC-related manner. A recent study revealed that DNA
damage response mediated by APOBEC3A (a member of APOBEC family) results in ROS
production (Niocel, Appourchaux, Nguyen, Delpeuch, & Cimarelli, 2019). ROS can induce
oxidative DNA damage, usually transforming guanine into 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-20deoxyguanine (oxoguanine), which can pair with adenine and lead to G>U substitution
(Molteni, Principi, & Esposito, 2014; Waris & Ahsan, 2006). However, to date, there is no
direct evidence of ROS-caused damage in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
Another mechanism that can mutate the viral genome is adenosine deaminase acting on
RNA (ADAR), which is an enzyme that mediates deamination of adenine to inosine (A>I) and
later changes to guanine (A>G) (Di Giorgio et al., 2020). A>G (plus strand) and U>C (minus
strand) substitutions are observed at similar levels (13.8%, and 9.6% of total substitutions,
respectively.) (Figure 2A). ADAR targets dsRNA, and therefore, equivalent levels of ADAR
activity is expected to present at both strands (Di Giorgio et al., 2020). The symmetric
mutation profile for this pattern strongly suggests that ADAR working on replication RNA is
effective in A>G and U>C substitutions.
In the context of trinucleotides, mutations dominantly occurred in U(C>U)G, A(C>U)G,
C(C>U)G, U(C>U)U, and A(C>U)A (Figure 2A). Notably, 3 out of the 5 most frequently
changed trinucleotides contain CG at their second and third positions. To examine whether
these mutations were predominantly located at a single position in the viral genome or are
distributed throughout the genome, we identified dynamic positions, where more than 8
recurring mutations were observed. Afterwards, we investigated the contribution of these
trinucleotide positions to the mutation profile (Figure 2B,C). With some exceptions, most
mutations in dynamic positions do not dominate the overall mutation profile. One of the
exceptions is G(G>C)G mutations occurred at position 28,883, which correspond to the

64.3% of all mutations occurring on GGG. Although the percentage is high, the number of
mutations occurring on GGG trinucleotides is only 14. Similarly G(A>U)C mutations at
position 29,869 correspond to the 29% of all mutations occurring on GAC trinucleotide, but
the number of mutations of GAC is as low as 31. However, when trinucleotides with a total
mutation number exceeding 200 are considered, the position with the highest mutation
becomes position 11,083 with U(G>U)U mutations, composing 15% of total mutations of
UGU. In conclusion, the mutation profile is not dominated by the switching positions; a
position bias on mutation distribution is only observable when the number of mutations of a
trinucleotide is low. Several mutations labeled as impactful on signatures (Figure 2B) have
been investigated for their possible effect on the severity and transmissibility of the virus by
various studies. The highest mutational position 11083, has been associated with the
severity of the virus (Toyoshima, Nemoto, Matsumoto, Nakamura, & Kiyotani, 2020).
Together with 11083, mutations at 23403, 21575, 28881, 28883 positions (Berrio, Gartner, &
Wray, 2020; Korber et al., 2020; van Dorp et al., 2020; Yin, 2020) have been associated with
significant indication towards selection. Particularly the D614G mutation on Spike protein is
associated with the fitness of the virus both by computational and clinical studies (Korber et
al., 2020; Plante et al., 2020; Yin, 2020).

are retrieved. The occurrences of these mutations are divided by the total number of the mutations of the same
type and observed in the same trinucleotide. The calculated ratio is used to visualize the impact of highly
occurring mutations on signature profile, as percentages (B). Number of mutations observed in the phylogenetic
tree, per position. Mutations which have a significant contribution to their signature visualized in part B, are
marked according to the mutation count they represent at the position. Marked mutations are colored and
reshaped with respect to their mutation type and impact range on their signatures (C).

Codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 differentiates in favor of A and U containing
codons
Next, we investigated the impact of a potential contribution of codon bias selection on the
mutation profile. First, we counted all the formed and altered codons, which we referred to as
“form” and “deform”, respectively. We calculated the relative difference between form and
deform values for each codon to test potential convergence to host codon usage through
mutations (Figure 3A). While UUU, AUA, AUU, and UAU are the intensively formed codons,
CCA, UGG, GCU, and ACA are the most diminished ones. These results indicate a dominant
forming of A and U containing trinucleotides, whereas G and C containing trinucleotides tend
to disappear and reduce in number. In addition, all the codons that are translated into alanine
(A) and proline (P) tend to diminish, resulting in lower translation of these amino acids in viral
proteins. Considering that all the codons of A and P contain GC and CC in the first and
second position, respectively, the reduction in these amino acids is probably related to
selection against G and C presence (Figure 3A).
Human coronaviruses are known to have low GC content (GC%) and SARS-CoV-2 is not an
exception with ~38 GC% (Berkhout & van Hemert, 2015; Xia, 2020). Moreover, it was
suggested that the reduction in GC% is an adaptation strategy of SARS-CoV-2, especially to
the human lung expressed genes (Y. Li et al., 2020). To determine whether the mutations of
SARS-CoV-2 is an adaptation strategy to increase its viability inside the host or just the
byproduct of host immune response to the viral RNA, we obtained the human codon usage
values (Nakamura, Gojobori, & Ikemura, 2000) and calculated the codon usage of SARSCoV-2 (see methods). We calculated the relative ratio of these values and grouped codons
that are translating the same amino acid (Figure 3B). If the viral genome is to adapt to the
host genome, one can hypothesize that the codons that are used dominantly in the host
relative to the virus should be formed in the viral genome to increase the similarity, while the
codons that are used dominantly in the virus should diminish. GCU, GAA, GGU, CGU
codons that are used relatively high in SARS-CoV-2, have the tendency to deform, in
agreement with the hypothesis. However, UGU, AUA, UUA, GUU codons that are also used
relatively high in SARS-CoV-2, have the tendency to be formed. A similar contradiction is
also observed in the codons that are highly used in the human genome. In general,

adaptation to the host codon usage cannot explain the formation tendency of the codons.
The main driver of the formation tendency is likely to be selection pressure against GC% and
thus, A and U increase.

formations over deformations per codon in log2 formation. (B) Relative codon usage percentage between Human
and SARS-CoV-2 reference genome.

CG nucleotide deforms, while UU nucleotide forms
After observing higher mutations in trinucleotides that contain CG at their second and third
positions, and higher deformation in G and C containing codons, we decided to examine the
deformation (Figure 4A) and formation (Figure 4B) of dinucleotides. Because deformation of
a dinucleotide is dependent on its occurrence in the genome, we normalized the deformed
value of each dinucleotide with respect to its occurrence in the reference genome. Also
suggested by others (Wang et al., 2020; Xia, 2020), CG dinucleotide is the most deformed
among all (Figure 4A). Xia et al. attributed the reduction in CG dinucleotide to a protein
called zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which binds and mediates the degradation of the
viral genome (Xia, 2020). Moreover, the study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is the most CG
deficient betacoronavirus (Xia, 2020). Thus, high CG deformation might be an adaptation of
SARS-CoV-2 to escape ZAP under high purifying selection. In addition, UU dinucleotide is

formed more than all other dinucleotides. In general, A and U containing dinucleotides are
formed, meanwhile C and G containing dinucleotides are deformed.

Figure 4: Comparison of dinucleotide formations and deformations retrieved from phylogenetic trees. Deformation
ratio of dinucleotides is represented as the ratio of deformation count in the tree over dinucleotide’s abundance in
the reference genome(A). As a result of the mutations the relative dinucleotides are formed (B).

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading aggressively, killing thousands of people and
affecting the daily lives of much more. Moreover, the evolutionary behavior of SARS-CoV-2
might potentially weaken the efficiency of the current treatments and vaccines. Here, we
performed a phylogenetic tree-based mutational analysis to assess the contribution of
mutagenesis and selection mechanism to SARS-CoV-2 mutation profiles.
The mutation profile of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that C>U, G>U, U>C, and A>G are the
dominant substitutions. Based on these mutational patterns, we compiled some potential
mechanisms that might be influencing the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome (Figure 5), which are
namely APOBEC, ADAR, and ZAP. These mechanisms were linked to SARS-CoV-2
mutagenesis in previous studies as well (Graudenzi et al., 2020; Kosuge, Furusawa-Nishii,

Ito, Saito, & Ogasawara, 2020; Xia, 2020). In addition, we suspect that ROS might be a
driver of G>U substitutions, however, more studies should be conducted to link ROS to
SARS-CoV-2.
Another aim of this study was to examine the main driver of the mutational patterns of SARSCoV-2; whether the viral genome is inclined to converge into the host genome or the
mechanisms we have discussed are the only contributors to the mutational patterns.
Analyses on formed and deformed codons exhibit an increase of A and U and a decrease of
G and C containing codons. Furthermore, the comparison between human and SARS-CoV-2
codon usage does not reveal a strong correlation between codon usage percentages and
SARS-CoV-2 formation tendency. These results combined, suggest that SARS-CoV-2
genome diverges through RNA editing mechanisms of the host, independently of any
adaptive mechanism to increase its genomic similarity to the host genome, which was
suggested in another study as well (Y. Li et al., 2020). Then, we examined the formation
tendency of dinucleotides. In general, we observed a decrease of G and C and an increase
of A and U containing dinucleotides. Strikingly, the deform rate of CG dinucleotides and
formation of UU dinucleotides is extremely high. This phenomenon, which was observed in
most human viruses (Caudill et al., 2020), was previously associated with the reduction of
the hydrogen bonds between strands to achieve more efficient gene expression (Wang et al.,
2020).
In conclusion, the mutational profile we generated supported the potential biological
mechanisms contributing to the genome diversity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Strand
asymmetry of some mutation signatures suggested the mechanism acting on the plus RNA
strand only. Strand-wise equivalent mutation signature attributed to ADAR is in agreement
with its mechanism of action where RNA is affected in the double-strand form. Antiviral
responses and selection cannot be distinguished from each other. Host responses against
the virus cause mutations in one hand and the reduced targets in the virus genome make it
less susceptible to the same antiviral attacks. Although we don’t suggest a direct antiviral
mechanism to reduce CG content, the reduced CG content can be explained by the
adaptation to the host antiviral mechanism by ZAP. So far, the virus has been affected by the
host antiviral mechanisms. Although there are several Spike protein amino acid substitutions
that are likely to provide a selection advantage (Chand et al., 2020; Volz et al., 2020),
selection hasn’t been a major driving force that can be applied to the entire genome. In the
coming months, with a wide administration of the vaccines, it might be possible to see the
effect of the vaccination and selection pressure by observing amino acid changes providing
an advantage in escaping from immunized hosts.

Methods
Data retrieval and mutation assignment
66,938 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and their metadata in the GISAID database, which was dated
until 18 July 2020 were retrieved (Shu & McCauley, 2017). Initially, all the sequences with
incomplete information (proper date or location of sample collection) in the metadata file
were filtered out with a custom python script. Then, the cd-hit program was used to cluster
sequences and choose representatives (-c 0.999 -M 0 -T 80) (Fu, Niu, Zhu, Wu, & Li, 2012).
20,089 clusters were created, of which 18,334 contained only a single sequence, while 1,755

of them contained multiple sequences (up to 14,867sequences in a cluster). Then, the first
sequence of each cluster was chosen as the representative of that cluster. After
representative selection, representative sequences were aligned with the MAFFT algorithm
using Augur toolkit (Hadfield et al., 2018; Katoh & Standley, 2016). Wuhan-Hu-1 genome
(GenBank: NC_045512.2) was chosen as the reference genome for the alignment. Then, a
phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE (-fast -n AUTO -m GTR).
The tree then reconstructed into a time-resolved tree using the treetime option of Augur
(Hadfield et al., 2018). The sample with the earliest collection date among the representative
sequences was chosen as the root and marginal maximum likelihood estimation was used
for date inference. The clock rate was applied across the genome to estimate the evolution
rate and set to 0.0008, with a standard deviation of 0.0004 and using the date confidence
flag to take the uncertainty of divergence time estimates into account. A constant coalescent
model was chosen and ‘covariance-aware’ mode of Augur was turned off with no covariance
flag. With these parameters, the number of representative sequences reduced to 19,045.
To assign the mutations to the nodes of the time-resolved tree, the ancestral option of Augur,
which infers the ancestral sequences, was used by giving the time-resolved tree and the
multiple sequence alignment of representative sequences as input (--inference joint).

Mutation profile analysis
Mutation list was obtained from the phylogenetic tree and includes the mutations observed in
each step of the tree. Then, this mutation list was divided into 192 groups based on their 12
mutation types (ie. A>U, G>C) and 16 different trinucleotide content where the mutation is
centered (ie. A>U:UAA, G>C:AGU). Each of the 192 mutation groups were normalized with
their corresponding trinucleotide count. Trinucleotides were normalized by the number of
occurrences in the reference genome. Finally, these normalized mutation count values were
plotted within the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016) using R language, colored by their
corresponding mutation type and trinucleotide content.
Observed mutations are first grouped by their position, mutation type and trinucleotide and
frequently observed mutations (more than 8 times) which occur on the same position on the
same trinucleotide, are recorded. Then observed mutations are grouped by their mutation
type and trinucleotide which resulted in a 192 group as indicated in the mutation profile. By
dividing the occurrence counts of frequently observed mutations to their corresponding
mutation and trinucleotide groups total occurrence count, the contribution of each mutation to
its profile is calculated and the ones who contributed more than 5% are plotted by ggplot2 in
R studio.

The number of mutations observed by position is plotted and previously recorded frequently
observed mutations (Figure 2B) are highlighted with respect to their mutation type and
contribution range.

Counting codon changes and codon usage
By using ancestral mutations from the time-resolved tree, the mutated codons were counted
and labeled as deformed count for each codon, while the count of the resulting codons were
referred to as formed codons. For each codon type, the ratio between formed and deformed
count was taken and plotted in log2 scale by using the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016).
Human codon usage table was retrieved (Nakamura et al., 2000), SARS-CoV-2 codon usage
table was calculated by a custom R script. Number of occurrences in the reference genome
was retrieved for each codon, then, they were grouped by their corresponding amino acids.
The ratio of use per codon was calculated by dividing the occurrence of that codon to the
sum of itself and its synonymous codons occurrence. Afterwards, the relative ratio of codon
usage between Homo Sapiens and SARS-CoV-2 was calculated by dividing the ratio of a
codon in one species to the sum of ratio in both species.

Dinucleotide changes
Observed mutations in the time-resolved tree were used to calculate the number of
deformations observed for each dinucleotide. Dinucleotides were formed by these mutations,
which were also calculated and recorded as the number of formations for that dinucleotide.
Then, observed counts in the reference genome per codon were retrieved. The deformation
counts were normalized by their division with their observation counts in the reference
genome and plotted with their formation counts by ggplot2 in R studio (Wickham, 2016).
