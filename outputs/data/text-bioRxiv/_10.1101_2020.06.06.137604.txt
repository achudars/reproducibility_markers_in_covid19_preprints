Abstract
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first
reported in Wuhan, China in November 2019 has developed into a pandemic since March 2020,
causing substantial human casualties and economic losses. Studies on SARS-CoV-2 are being
carried out at an unprecedented rate to tackle this threat. Genomics studies, in particular, are
indispensable to elucidate the dynamic nature of the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. RNA
viruses are marked by their unique ability to undergo high rates of mutation in their genome,
much more frequently than their hosts, which diversifies their strengths qualifying them to elude
host immune response and amplify drug resistance. In this study, we sequenced and analyzed the
genomic information of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates from two infected Indian patients and
explored the possible implications of point mutations in its biology. In addition to multiple point
mutations, we found a remarkable similarity between relatively common mutations of 36nucleotide deletion in ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2. Our results corroborate with the earlier reported
29-nucleotide deletion in SARS, which was frequent during the early stage of human-to-human
transmission. The results will be useful to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and
itsattenuation for vaccine development.

Brief report
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the
novel human Corona Virus Disease COVID-19, first reported on November 17th, 2019 in
Wuhan, China [12]. It has spread rapidly creating a global public health emergency situation in
the last few months and the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020 declared it a
pandemic. Till date, SARS-CoV-2 has infected close to five million people and caused more than
328,000 deaths globally. Although started late, India showed ramping of more than 112,000
reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection including more than 3,400 deaths, as of May 20th, 2020. As
compared to the other recent coronavirus epidemics SARS, 2003 and MERS (Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome), 2012 having mortality rates of 11% [4] and 35% [8], respectively,
SARS-CoV-2 has a current mortality rate of about 3.4% [7]. However, the transmissibility of
SARS-CoV-2 recorded far greater than the previous coronavirus epidemics.
SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense 29.9 kbp RNA genome, encoding 12 open reading
frames (ORFs) [6]. It codes for four structural proteins, namely spike glycoprotein (S), envelope
glycoprotein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) [12]. S protein is a
large membrane protein which helps in endocytosis of the viral particle into the host cell by
binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [15]. E protein is a small viral
transmembrane protein which helps in the assembly of the virions by forming ion channels inside
the host cell [5]. M protein is the most abundant protein present on the viral membrane,
important for morphogenesis and viral assembly [2]. N protein is responsible for the packaging
of the viral genome and plays an important role in viral assembly [13]. The genome also codes
for 2 overlapping polyproteins, namely polyprotein 1a (PP1a) and polyprotein 1ab (PP1ab); PP1a
being a truncated version of PP1ab. These code for 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs) including

proteases (3C-like protease and Papain-like protease) and RNA-processing enzymes like RNAdependent RNA polymerase, Helicase, 3'-5' Exonuclease, Endoribonuclease, Guanine N7methyltransferase, 2’O- ribose methyltransferase and ADP ribose phosphatase [12]. In addition
to structural and NSPs, SARS-CoV-2 genome also codes for at least two other viroporin
candidates (other than the E protein), namely ORF3a and ORF8 [3]. The function and the
possible contribution of other ORFs in the viral infection are largely unknown.
There is a global race to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 to understand its variability among
the population and identify the unique mutation. Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre
(GBRC), Gujarat India, actively involved in the complete genome sequencing of SAR-CoV-2
strains from India. More than 144 complete genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the
state have been completed. The samples were collected from the COVID-19 testing center
following the guidelines of Indian council of Medical research. The complete genome
sequencing of the samples were carried out by the gene specific primer sets using the Ion S5™
next-generation sequencing system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) following manufacturer’s
protocol. In this study, we are reporting the unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome
isolates from India.
The two samples from a male and female aged 66 (husband and wife) has been procured
from the COVID-19 testing facility in Gujarat, India. Husband and wife contracted infection
from their son who got it from local/community transmission. Both were recovered without
having severe symptoms of COVID-19.
The complete genome sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from both the patients
showed a size of 29902 bp each (accession numbers MT435081 and MT435082), in contrast
with 29903 bp size of the Wuhan strain. However, the single nucleotide deletions in the genome

of virus isolates from these two patients were at different positions. Furthermore, the sequence
revealed a total of ten mutations each across the genome as compared to SARS-CoV-2 strain
from Wuhan. The details of the mutations in the Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates areprovided in
Table 1.
The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from the virus isolates of two patients in Gujrat,
India, were analyzed and compared with the isolate from Wuhan, China. The single nucleotide
change in the viral genome could change the encoding amino acid, which might result in the
conformational change in the viral structure protein [11]. The genome of virus isolates from both
patients showed a point mutation of C241T corresponding to its genome length and lies in the 5'
untranslated region (5' UTR). It is unlikely that this mutation has any substantial effect on viral
replication. The nucleotide change of C1059T in the protein ORF1ab has directed threonine, a
polar uncharged amino acid, to mutate into a hydrophobic amino acid, isoleucine. Threonine
residues are well known to form hydrogen-bond interactions with surrounding polar residues in
the interior of protein structure. The amino acid residues around this threonine at position 265
corresponding to the polyproteinORF1ab correspond to

262

K-F-D-T-F-N-G-E-C-P271 suggesting

that threonine might form hydrogen bonds with surrounding polar residues. Perhaps it might also
assist in the formation of protein bend caused due to glycine and proline having the position of i,
i+3 with respect to each other. Isoleucine being hydrophobic might disturb any conformational
protein bend due to its inability to form a hydrogen bond. This mutation might also result in
increased hydrophobic interactions with surrounding phenylalanine residues. Since very little is
known about NSP2 or any of its homologous structure, no assertion at the structural level could
be made.

In the native form, NSP12 is bound with the cofactors NSP7 and NSP8 to form the RNA
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex. The mutation of C14408T at NSP12 in Indian
isolates of SARS-CoV-2 lead to the substitution of proline with threonine. The proline residue at
position 323 corresponding to the polyprotein results in an unusual turn in the alpha-helix in
which it resides [14]. Interestingly, the α-helix is one of the sites for the interaction of NSP12
with the cofactor, NSP8. However, this mutation of proline causes significant changes into the
structure due to the disturbance of that turn in that α-helix (Fig. 1A). This would probably
change the entire structure of that interacting site, leading to the decreased affinity of RdRP to
NSP8 which likely disturbs its functioning. Mutation study in the 3-D structure of NSP12 (Fig.
1B and C) suggests that this mutation results in substantial stabilization of this region (ΔΔG =
1.540 kcal/mol). This mutation also imparts great rigidity to the site (ΔΔSVib = - 4.074 kcal.mol1

.K-1).However, the large amount of flexibility originally present in this site might be vital for the

functionality of RdRP. This corroborates with our prediction that this mutation might be
deleterious for the activity of RdRP.
The mutation of polar residue threonine into a hydrophobic residue methionine due to the
mutation of C15371T might also significantly affect the protein structure of NSP12. The
governing residues around the mutated threonine at position 644 of polyprotein NSP12 are 640RK-H-T-T-C-C-S-L-S649. Presence of two cysteine residues at an immediate position to threonine
propounds formation of cystine residue by the aid of cellular oxidation. The catalytic and
enzymatic activity of cysteine residues bound by disulfide bridges plays a crucial role in the
folding and stability of extracellular proteins exposed to the harsh extracellular environment
[10]. Mutation of threonine into methionine is likely to disturb this disulfide bridge and
enzymatic function of cysteine residues, hence the three-dimensional structure and stability of

the protein owing to the bulky side chain of methionine [1]. Methionine being a non-polar
hydrophobic residue would bury inside the protein thus hampering the immediate cysteine
residues in their reactivity as well. Since this amino acid residue lies within a flexible loop region
at a site far from the catalytic site of RdRP, this mutation is unlikely to have any significant
change in the structureof RdRP.
Mutation of C17747T of viral mRNA results in the substitution of proline into leucine at
the 504th amino acid of NSP13 (helicase). However, this site lies in a flexible loop region, far
from the functionally active domains of the helicase protein. This mutation is less likely to have
any effect on the activity of helicase.
Mutation of A23403G causes the substitution of aspartic acid with glycine. This mutation
in the S protein lies in the small loop turn between two anti-parallel beta-strands. These betastrands participate actively in the trimerization of spike protein which is vital for binding of S
protein to its receptor ACE2 [14]. Replacing the aspartic acid residue with the much more
flexible glycine might end up in disturbing the β-strands. Prediction of effect of the mutation on
the secondary structure (Fig. 2 A) suggests that this mutation is likely to disrupt one of the four
beta-strands in that region, thus possibly inhibiting the trimerization of spike protein on the
surface of the virus. This could significantly decrease the affinity of S protein to ACE2 receptors
as well.
As a result of the mutation of G25563T, glutamine gets substituted into histidine in the
ORF3a protein. The residues governing this glutamine at position 57 of the ORF3a protein are
52

L-L-A-V-F-Q-S-A-S-K61. Histidine substituting glutamine would be converting this sequence

site into a more polybasic site that might result in a proteolytic cleavage site. The mutation lies in
the loop region of two of the three transmembrane domains of ORF3a viroporin. Since none of

the transmembrane domainsis being disturbed, the function of this viroporin might not be
affected by this mutation.
Due to the mutation of G28221T, encoding amino acid glutamic acid gets substituted by
a stop codon resulting in a 36-nucleotide long deletion in the C-terminal of ORF8. The deletion
leads to truncation at the C-terminal of ORF8 which results in a protein of 109 residues instead
of 121 of the wild-type protein. Secondary structure prediction of the wild-type protein and the
mutated variant (Fig. 2 B) suggests that the C-terminal of this protein (70-118 amino acids) in
the wild-type ORF8 protein was found to have four uniformly-spaced beta-strands. However,
this mutation was found to essentially chop off the fourth beta-strand. The highly organized
secondary structure of the C-terminal of the protein is likely to have some function in the viral
replication or infectivity. This mutation truncating the fourth beta-strand probably disturbs its
function. Thus, this mutation might be severely affecting the functionality of the ORF8 protein.
We also found this same mutation in the virus isolate from an unrelated individual suggesting
that this mutation might be relatively common. This result has a striking similarity with that of
an in-vivo experiment reported earlier on SARS CoV-1 where a 29-nucleotide deletion in the
ORF8 gene was the most obvious genetic change in the early stage of human-to-human
transmission of SARS CoV-1[9]. Moreover, the 29-nucleotide deleted SARS CoV-1 strain had a
23-fold less viral replication as compared to its wild type, suggesting that this mutation
effectively attenuated the virus. The conspicuous similarity with our result might shed light into
the attenuation of the Indian strain of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. It would be interesting to further
explore its possibility for vaccine development.
Interestingly, the mutation in ORF8 was found when A at 28254th position was found to
be deleted. However, another stop codon was formed 12 nucleotides farther due to this

frameshift mutation. As a result, the last two residues of the protein get changed and additional
four amino acids get incorporated in the C-terminal of the resulting protein. Since the
modifications are at the terminal and in a non-conserved region of the protein, this mutation is
unlikely to affect the activity of ORF8.

The mutation of G28371T results in the substitution of serine into isoleucine which lies in
a region away from any of the functional domains of the N protein. Thus, it is less likely to have
any significant effect on the structure of the protein. However, with the amino acid residues 18GG-P-S-D-S-T-G-S-N-Q-N-G-E31 around this position 26 of the N protein, mutation of serine into
isoleucine is likely to bury the protein structure inside due to the hydrophobic nature of
isoleucine. As predicted by NetOGlyc 4.0 Server, we find this region to be a potential O-linked
glycosylation site. All the serine and threonine residues mentioned in the short surrounding
sequence above are predicted to be a site for O-linked glycosylation making it a heavily
glycosylated site. Since glycosylation of viral proteins is a very important post-translational
modification governing the virulence of a virus, mutation of this site into a hydrophobic residue
can compromise the glycosylation process. Presence of glycine and proline residues around this
region is expected to give the structure kink and expose these residues for a potential O-linked
glycosylation process. Hence, this mutation of serine into isoleucine is expected to heavily
inhibit and compromise this modification in this region.
