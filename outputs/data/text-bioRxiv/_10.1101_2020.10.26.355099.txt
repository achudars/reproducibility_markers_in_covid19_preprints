Abstract:
Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is the key event during translation of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA genome allowing synthesis of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and downstream
viral proteins. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian ribosome in the process
5

of translating viral RNA paused in a conformation primed for frameshifting. We observe that the
viral RNA adopts a pseudoknot structure lodged at the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome to
generate tension in the mRNA that leads to frameshifting. The nascent viral polyprotein that is
being synthesized by the ribosome paused at the frameshifting site forms distinct interactions
with the ribosomal polypeptide exit tunnel. We use biochemical experiments to validate our

10

structural observations and to reveal mechanistic and regulatory features that influence the
frameshifting efficiency. Finally, a compound previously shown to reduce frameshifting is able
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells, establishing coronavirus frameshifting as
target for antiviral intervention.

Main Text:
Ribosomal frameshifting, a process during which the reading frame of translation is changed in
the middle of the coding sequence, is one of the key events during translation of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive sense single-stranded RNA genome.
5

This so-called programmed -1 translational frameshifting is conserved in all coronaviruses and is
necessary for synthesis of viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Nsp12 or RdRp) and
downstream viral non-structural proteins encoding core enzymatic functions involved in capping
of viral RNA, RNA modification and processing, and RNA proof-reading. Although the
translational machinery typically prevents frameshifting as a potential source of one of the most

10

disruptive errors in translation (1, 2), many viruses rely on programmed ribosomal frameshifting
to expand and fine-tune the repertoire and stoichiometry of expressed proteins(3).
Programmed -1 frameshifting in SARS-related coronaviruses occurs at the slippery
sequence U_UUA_AAC in the context of a 3’ stimulatory RNA sequence that was predicted to
form a 3-stemmed pseudoknot structure (4), the importance of which was tested by our lab and

15

others (5, 6). The frameshifting occurs with high efficiency (25-75% depending on the system
used (5–9) and changes the reading frame to UUU_AAA_C (10) (Fig. 1A). A putative secondary
structure element in the viral RNA that forms a loop upstream of the shift site has been proposed
to play an attenuating role in frameshifting and is referred to as the 5’ attenuator loop (11).
Maintaining the precise level of coronavirus frameshifting efficiency is crucial for viral

20

infectivity, evidenced by the remarkable fact that mutation of a single nucleotide in the
frameshifting region of the SARS-CoV RNA results in a concomitant abrogation of viral
replication (12). Therefore, the criticality of pseudoknot-dependent -1 ribosomal frameshifting in
the propagation of SARS-related coronaviruses, a process that does not occur in human cells,
presents itself as an opportune drug-target with minimal tolerance for drug-resistant mutations.

25

Due to its importance in the life cycle of many important viruses and coronaviruses in
particular, programmed frameshifting has been extensively studied using a range of structural
and functional approaches (3). The structure of a 3’ stimulatory pseudoknot in isolation or in
context of the viral genome has been proposed recently by various groups using techniques that
include molecular dynamics, nuclease mapping, in vivo SHAPE, NMR and cryo-EM (6, 13–16).

Furthermore, a ribosomal complex with a frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot from the avian

infectious bronchitis virus was reported at low resolution (17). Here, to provide a structural and
mechanistic description of the events that ensue during ribosomal frameshifting, we investigated
mammalian ribosomes captured in distinct functional states during translation of a region of
SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA where -1 programmed frameshifting occurs.
5

Structure determination of a frameshifting-primed ribosomal complex
We initially intended to capture a 0 frame, pre-frameshift ribosomal complex by first introducing
a stop codon in place of the second codon of the slippery site (U_UUA_AAC to U_UUA_UAA),
achieving stalling by means of utilizing a mutant eRF1 (AAQ) that is unable to release the
10

nascent polypeptide and would, therefore, trap the ribosome in the act of decoding the mutant
frameshift site in the 0 frame. Translating complexes were prepared in an in vitro translation
reaction using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) system generated in-house (see Methods). The
ribosomes were programmed with mRNA harboring a region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that
encodes proteins Nsp10 (C-terminus), Nsp11 and the majority of Nsp12. Western blotting

15

showed that when using the WT RNA template, frameshifting was efficient, while the stop
codon mutation prevented frameshifting and led to ribosome stalling when eRF1 (AAQ) was
present (Fig. 1B). Curiously, we also observed a prominent band corresponding to a tRNAbound product paused in the vicinity of the frameshift site even in the absence of eRF1 (AAQ).
Indeed, cryo-electron microscopic 3D reconstruction of RNCs purified from the reactions

20

supplemented with eRF1 (AAQ) revealed that the majority of ribosomal particles corresponded
to a paused ribosome with no detectable eRF1 (AAQ) (fig. S1). The 80S ribosomes were found
captured in the process of translation with P- and E- site tRNAs bound, and with a nascent
polypeptide chain in the ribosomal tunnel.
Incidentally, the 2.2 Å resolution obtained for our reconstruction allowed us to build the

25

most accurate structure of a mammalian 80S ribosome so far and directly visualize virtually all
rRNA modifications proposed for the human ribosome based on quantitative mass spectrometry,
which is not surprising since all modified residues are also conserved in rabbit rRNAs (18) (fig.
S2 and S3). Notably, these results are not consistent with the modifications of the human rRNAs
recently proposed based on interpretations of EM maps (19).

Importantly, further classification revealed a prominent density for a complete 3’
frameshifting stimulatory pseudoknot at the entry of the mRNA channel on the 40S subunit (Fig.
1C-D). The resolution of this reconstruction ranged from 2.3 Å at the core of the ribosome to ~7
Å at the periphery, where the most flexible regions of the pseudoknot are located (fig. S1 and
5

S2). Based on the high-resolution maps that allowed visualization of the codon-anticodon
interactions and modifications in the tRNA (Fig. 1E, fig. S4A-B), we could unequivocally
determine that a Phe-tRNA(Phe) was bound at the P-site (20). This implied that the ribosome is
paused by the downstream pseudoknot such that the P-site tRNA interacts with the UUU codon
just prior to the first codon of the frameshift site (Fig. 2A).

10

The SARS-Co-V-2 RNA pseudoknot specifically interacts with ribosomal proteins and 18S
rRNA
The intermediate local resolution (5-7 Å) of the cryo-EM map in the area of the pseudoknot
allowed us to visualize the overall fold of the RNA and readjust its previously predicted
15

secondary structure (13–16, 21) (Fig. 1E). The stimulatory pseudoknot forms an H-type
pseudoknot with Stem 1 and Stem 2 coaxially stacked on top of each other to form a quasicontinuous helix, while Stem 3 stands out almost perpendicular to this plane (Fig. 1D and 2B).
This corkscrew-like formation provides a bulky and well-structured obstacle wedged at the
mRNA entry channel, having the potential to resist unwinding by the helicase activity of the

20

ribosome and generating tension on the upstream mRNA up to the decoding center. Stem 1 of
the pseudoknot forms a 9 bp helix which is GC rich at the bottom (Fig. 1F). The penultimate
nucleotides of the ‘spacer region’ prior to Stem 1 are located at the mRNA entry tunnel, where
they interact with several basic residues in the C-terminal domain of uS3 on one side and are
supported by uS5 from the other, with an additional weak contact being made from the C-

25

terminal end of eS30. uS3 and eS30 are primary components of the ribosome helicase and uS5
has been proposed to be a component of the ribosomal helicase processivity clamp at the mRNA
entry site (22, 23). The observed distance between the P-site UUU codon and Stem 1 of the
pseudoknot underscore the critical dependence of the frameshifting efficiency on the length of
the spacer region (24). Translocation to the next codon would place the frameshifting codon

UUA into the P-site, with a simultaneous increase in the tension of the mRNA and unwinding of
the GC-rich base of Stem 1 upon entering into the mRNA entry channel.
The pseudoknot structure also reveals a hitherto unobserved and possibly unappreciated
role for the distal site of the mRNA entrance channel in helicase activity. While mRNA
5

unwinding studies outside the mRNA entrance channel have so far implicated only a helix in the
C-terminal domain of uS3 (25), we notice that Loop 1 of the pseudoknot contacts the N-terminal
domain of uS3 as well as the C-terminal tail of eS10 (Fig. 2B and fig. S4D), whereas the flippedout base G13486 in this loop forms specific interactions (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, as the
pseudoknot is located at the entry to the mRNA channel, helix h16 of the 18S rRNA is

10

noticeably pushed outwards due to a direct contact with the minor groove of Stem 1 (Fig. 2B, fig.
S5A). Since the pseudoknot wedges between the head and the body of the small ribosomal
subunit, it would restrict their relative motions that need to take place during translocation. This
is consistent with the studies on dynamics of coronavirus frameshifting, which revealed that the
mechanism of -1 frameshifting involves restriction of small subunit head motion (26).

15

The structure also reveals another key aspect of the architecture of the pseudoknot as the
ribosome encounters it. The start of the pseudoknot is shifted relative to the predicted secondary
structure (13–16, 21) by two nucleotides. The two opposed nucleotides, which were assumed to
base pair with Stem 1, are actually forming the start of Stem 3 by pairing with bases predicted to
be in the single-stranded linker 2 (Fig. 1F, fig. S5B-C). Our cryo-EM density reveals that Loop 3

20

accommodates a total of 4 nucleotides, three of which were originally attributed to Stem 2. Thus,
we observe that Loop 3 is shifted and expanded relative to the initially predicted secondary
structures (13–16, 21).
To functionally support our structural findings and confirm the nature and specificity of
the pseudoknot interactions, we performed structure-guided mutagenesis experiments using dual

25

luciferase reporter assays in HEK cells (see Methods) and monitored the frameshifting efficiency
relative to the WT (Fig. 2C). Mutation of G13486 of Loop 1 to another purine reduced the
frameshifting efficiency to 30% of the WT level, and mutation of this base to a pyrimidine
further reduced frameshifting to 15%. As expected from our structural data, deletions of the
nucleotides of the spacer regions also had a deteriorating effect on frameshifting. Loss of Loop 1

30

entirely abolished frameshifting. Deletion of a single nucleotide of Loop 3, which would not be

expected to have an effect on the folding of the pseudoknot based on the previously suggested
secondary structures where it is flipped out (21) , diminished the frameshifting rate to 25% of the
WT level. Loss of the entire Loop 3 reduced frameshifting to 10% of WT levels.

5

Frameshifting efficiency depends on the position of the “0” frame stop codon
In SARS-CoV-2, the 0 frame stop codon is located 5 codons downstream of the frameshift site
and is a constituent of Stem 1. The placement of the stop codon in such proximity to the
frameshift site is a common feature in coronaviruses, and its presence in a critical region of the
stimulatory pseudoknot prompted us to probe the effect of the distance of the 0 frame stop codon

10

on frameshifting. To this end, knowledge of the 3D structure of the pseudoknot helped us to
confidently manipulate the stop codon without hampering pseudoknot formation. We introduced
mutations to incrementally extend the stop codon from the WT position and to completely
remove the occurrence of a stop codon in the 0 frame (Fig. 2D). While introducing a stop codon
6 nucleotides downstream of the WT position only marginally decreased the frameshifting rate

15

(98% of WT), a stronger attenuation was observed when the distance of the stop codon was
increased to 15 nucleotides from the WT stop (80% of WT). Finally, removal of the stop codon
by two different point mutations led to a reduction of frameshifting efficiency to 45% of WT
levels.
Taken together, these observations suggest that the stop codon position plays an

20

important role in maintaining optimum frameshift efficiency. We propose that the stop codon
serves to prevent the closely trailing ribosome from encountering an RNA that was unfolded by
the leading ribosome. In this case, upon encountering a stop codon, termination and subunit
disassembly will occur, which will provide an opportunity for the pseudoknot to refold without
the constrains of the mRNA channel (see Conclusions). This mechanism, consistent with our

25

biochemical data, increases the efficiency of frameshifting to the levels required by SARS-CoV2 and may be used by viruses in general when high-efficiency frameshifting is required.

Inhibition of viral replication by a compound that targets the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot
The extreme sensitivity of the coronavirus to the finely controlled frameshifting levels (12) may
present an opportunity to develop compounds that interfere with the frameshifting process and
5

thus inhibit replication of the virus. Using computational modeling and reporter assays,
compounds that have been predicted to bind the pseudoknot and inhibit SARS-CoV-2
frameshifting were described (21, 27), but never tested with respect to their ability to inhibit viral
replication. To demonstrate that the inhibition of frameshifting is a plausible strategy for drug
development, we synthesized MTDB, one of these previously described compounds (21, 27,

10

28), and tested whether it is able to reduce viral levels in infected African green monkey Vero
cells (Fig. 3, see Methods). The compound showed no cellular toxicity and resulted in a 3 orders
of magnitude reduction of SARS-CoV-2 titer, with the half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) of 48 µΜ (Fig. 3). Although this potency range is still far from what would be expected
from a potential drug candidate, it nevertheless provides a starting point for high-throughput

15

screening, and establishes that frameshifting is a viable target for therapeutic intervention against
SARS-CoV-2.

The nascent chain modulates the frameshift efficiency in SARS-CoV-2
Strikingly, in the reconstruction of the paused translating ribosome, the nascent chain that
20

corresponds to the viral polyprotein was visible along the entire length of the ribosomal exit
tunnel (Fig. 4A). The density corresponded to the C-terminal region of Nsp10, which is the
activator of the viral proofreading exonuclease and N7-methyltransferase Nsp14 (29, 30) and
then, depending on the frameshifting event, continues as either the viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase Nsp12 (5) or protein Nsp11, the function of which is yet unknown (Fig. 1A and 4B).

25

The nascent chain makes several specific interactions with the ribosomal tunnel, one of which is
at the constriction site where arginine 4387 of Nsp10 interacts with A1555 of the 28S rRNA
(corresponding to A1600 in humans, numbering according to PDB 6EK0 (19)) and is stabilized
by the preceding leucine 4386 (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, these two amino acids are very well
conserved across multiple coronaviruses (fig. 4G), although they are located in the unstructured

C-terminal region of Nsp10 and therefore considered not to be important for the fold of the
protein (31).
Further down the tunnel, the C-terminal end of Nsp10 adopts a partially-folded zinc
finger motif (Fig. 4D-E), which upon superposition reveals similarity with the corresponding
5

fully folded C-terminal domain previously observed in the crystal structure of SARS-CoV Nsp10
(31). Tryptophan 4376 located between the two pairs of cysteines that form the zinc finger stacks
with A2261 (A2418), an interaction that might serve to promote the change of nascent chain
direction and facilitate folding of the zinc finger at the end of the exit tunnel. Co-translational
events, such as insertion of a transmembrane domain at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel, was

10

shown to promote -1 ribosomal frameshifting in alphaviruses (32).
To investigate whether the observed contacts between the nascent chain and the
ribosomal tunnel are specific, and whether these interactions and co-translational folding of
Nsp10 might play a role in modulating the frameshifting process, we employed our dual
luciferase reporter assay to measure the frameshifting efficiency of WT and mutant nascent chain

15

sequence constructs. As our measurements in HEK cells did not reveal an appreciable change of
frameshift efficiency, we carried out the same experiments in vitro using RRL to monitor the
effects in a single mRNA setup. Replacement of the entire nascent chain with an unrelated
sequence leads to a 35% increase in frameshifting (Fig. 4F). The extent of this change is clearly
not due to loss of the 5’ attenuator loop, as indicated by an experiment where silent attenuator

20

loop mutations result in only a slight increase in frameshifting. Mutation of the leucine 4386 and
arginine 4387 to alanine led to a considerable (30%) increase in frameshifting (Fig. 4F-G),
implying that these nascent chain interactions with the ribosomal exit tunnel play an important
role in regulating frameshifting levels, possibly mechanistically akin to the well-studied SecM
stalling system in bacteria (33), where it was shown that co-translational folding and the

25

translocon-induced mechanical force can rescue the stall induced by interactions between the
nascent chain and the ribosomal tunnel (34). These observations also imply that any cellular
nascent-chain factors (35, 36), or even the intracellular concentration of Zn2+, which is known to
change in response to viral infections (37), might influence the rate of frameshifting.

Conclusions
Our results provide a mechanistic description of frameshifting that occurs during translation of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome and reveal the features that may be exploited by the virus to finely
5

control the stoichiometry of viral proteins at different stages of infection (Fig. 5). Interfering with
the frameshifting process at the level of nascent chain interactions with the ribosomal tunnel, at
the level of RNA folding that leads to the formation of the frameshift stimulatory pseudoknot, or
to perturb the interactions between the pseudoknot and the mRNA channel, represent a viable
strategy in our search for new drugs against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is currently causing the

10

global COVID-19 pandemic. Our results will also be useful for understanding the mechanism of
programmed ribosomal “-1” frameshifting employed by many other medically important viruses.

(A13537) in Loop 2 reduces frameshifting, while deletion of the entire loop (ΔL2) abolishes
frameshifting. Normalized (Firefly/Renilla) luciferase activites were calculated for each
construct as a percentage of their individual normalized in-frame controls. Data are presented as
mean values ± standard deviations of three biological replicates (sets of translation reactions)
5

averaged after three measurements, with error bars representing standard deviations. (D)
Mutagenesis experiments using dual luciferase reporter assays in HEK cells show that the
position of the 0 frame stop codon influences frameshifting. Leaving the pseudoknot unaltered,
incremental increase in the distance of the 0 frame stop codon from the frameshift site leads to a
concomitant decrease in frameshifting levels. Loss of the stop codon in 0 frame leads to a sharp

10

decline in frameshifting levels.

nascent C-terminus of Nsp10 (orange) and the N-terminus of Nsp11/12 (purple) are visible from
the PTC to the periphery of the ribosome exit tunnel (LSU in blue). (B) Schematic representation
of the path of nascent peptide along the exit tunnel. Arg 4387 stacks with 28S rRNA residue

tested for their effect on frameshifting. Replacement of the entire nascent chain with an unrelated
sequence leads to a 35% increase in frameshifting, which is only in part due to loss of the 5’
attenuator loop. Interactions around the constriction site likely serve to attenuate frameshifting,
as replacement of the interacting Arg 4387 and stabilizing Leu 4386 with Ala increases
5

frameshifting by 30%. (G) Alignment of SARS2 with closely related sequences of other
coronaviruses highlighting the conservation of the mutated residues (colored as in (F)). The
shown sequence stretch encompasses the C-terminal zinc finger domain of Nsp10 (orange) and
parts of Nsp11/Nsp12 (purple) visible in our reconstruction. Nascent chain residues Leu 4386
and Arg 4387 interacting with the ribosomal exit tunnel are strictly conserved, while the

10

conservation of neighboring residues is lower. Stars represent the four cysteines of the Nsp10

Fig. 5 Structure based model for -1 programmed frameshifting in coronaviruses and its
regulation.
The observed interactions between the pseudoknot and the ribosome prime the system for
5

frameshifting. The features of the pseudoknot and the interactions between the nascent chain and
the ribosomal tunnel play a role in the efficiency of frameshifting. The efficiency of
frameshifting is increased by the presence of a stop codon near the frameshifting site. Ribosomes
that progress beyond the frameshifting site in the 0 frame quickly terminate and disassemble,
thereby increasing the chances that the pseudoknot will refold before it is encountered by the

10

closely trailing ribosome. The trailing ribosome in turn encounters the pseudoknot, which
increases the possibility of undergoing -1 frameshifting.
