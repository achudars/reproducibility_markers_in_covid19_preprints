Abstract
COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host cell
surface receptor ACE2 is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection. By
analyzing the spike-hACE2 interacting surface, we predicted many hot spot residues
that make major contributions to the binding affinity. Mutations on most of these
residues are likely to be deleterious, leading to less infectious virus strains that may
suffer from negative selection. Meanwhile, several residues with mostly advantageous
mutations have been predicted. It is more probable that mutations on these residues
increase the transmission ability of the virus by enhancing spike-hACE2 interaction.
So far, only a limited number of mutations has been reported in this region. However,
the list of hot spot residues with predicted downstream effects from this study can still
serve as a tracking list for SARS-CoV-2 evolution studies. Coincidentally, one
advantageous mutation, p.476G>S, started to surge in the last couple of weeks based
on the data submitted to the public domain, indicating that virus strains with increased
transmission ability may have already spread.

Introduction
On March 11th 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the novel
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic crisis. The pathogen, namely severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the third coronavirus that
causes serious global outbreak of the infectious diseases in 21st century after Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). CoVs are by far the largest known
positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with highly conserved genome in regions
that encode the CoVs core proteins. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are
members of the beta-coronavirus genus with the genome size of approximately 30
kilobases. CoV genome begins with a 5’ replicase gene that encodes the nonstructural
proteins (Nsps), followed by four major virion structural protein coding genes that are
crucial for the transmission and proliferation of the virus. Specifically, the spike
glycoprotein (S, or spike) is mainly responsible for the cross-species and
human-to-human transmission of CoVs via its interactions with the host cell receptors
before inducing cell fusion. The small envelope protein (E) and the membrane protein
(M) play important roles in viral assembly. Apart from its role as a structural protein,
the nucleocapsid protein (N) also involves in the replication and transcription of the
viral genomic information. The genome is capped at the 5’ with a 3’ poly(A) tail,
similar to eukaryotic mRNA.
Comparative genomics research [1, 2] and studies with experimental validations
[3, 4] have revealed the cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on binding of the spike
protein and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells.
Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibits similar binding affinity to SARS-CoV spike
protein with hACE2 [3], and the binding affinity correlates with the overall viral
replication rate and the disease transmission rate [5-7], suggesting the comparable
transmission rate between SARS-CoV-2 [8] and SARS-CoV.
During the epidemic outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, multiple genetically
diverse SARS-CoV strains have been identified, but none of them showed significant

higher virulence over others [9, 10]. According to recent studies and the phylogeny
relationship of SARS-CoV-2 [11, 12], it is expected that the mutation rate of
SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the majority of other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV
[13, 14], with approximately 10-6 nucleotides per site per cell infection. As of April
12th 2020, there are over 1.8 million infections spreading to more than 200
counties/areas for SARS-CoV-2 and the numbers are still escalating. In contrast, only
~8,000 infections from 14 countries have been reported worldwide by the time
SARS-CoV is contained. Consequently, with significantly higher number of infections
in a pandemic scale, SARS-CoV-2 is expect to accumulate more mutations than
SARS-CoV. Even though in theory, the virulence is expected to be high in the early
stage of an epidemic, and will be decreased overtime until an endemic equilibrium is
reached [15-19], there is still an urging need for studies on possible mutation
outcomes on the transmission of the disease during COVID-19 pandemic.
In this study, we utilized existing models to identify key residues on
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that interacts with hACE2. We predicted possible amino
acids substitutions that may significantly alter the binding affinity between spike and
hACE2 using computational methods, thereby inferring the changes in the
transmission rate of mutated virus strains. We then downloaded nearly 700
SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences from GISAID [20, 21] to identify potential
strains embedding these high risk mutations. Results have shown that currently no
mutations have been identified near the S-hACE2 interaction surface area. Although it
seems that the whole spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is subject to negative
selection, there are still multiple predicted advantageous mutations near the S-hACE2
interaction surface area that could promote virus transmission. In fact, the number of
strands with the advantageous mutations predicted by this study starts to stand out,
indicating that virus strands with higher transmission may have already spread.

Results and discussion
Mutations in spike RBD and the predicted impacts on viral transmission
We inspected the hot spot residues that contribute to S-hACE2 interaction (figure 1a).
Overall, 39 important residues within 6 Å around hACE2 were identified (table 1).
Among these residues, 14 of them are directly interact with hACE2 via hydrophobic
interaction or hydrogen bonding. We iterated all possible single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) for each residue and analyzed the downstream impact of these
amino acid alterations. Here, synonymous mutations and non-synonymous with

ΔAffinity

between -1.5 and 1.5 [22] were defined as neutral mutation, whereas

non-synonymous mutation with ΔAffinity

≥ 1.5 or SNPs that lead to pre-termination

stop codons are considered as deleterious. The rest of mutations are characterized as
advantageous, since the S-hACE2 interaction are benefited from the amino acid
substitution (ΔAffinity

≤

-1.5). For instance, figure 1b showed that the S-hACE2

binding could be benefit by a hydrogen bond formation between SLys498 and
hACE2Gln42, in addition to a salt bridge formation between SLys498 and hACE2Asp38,
despite a hydrogen bond loss between SGln498 and hACE2Gln42 due to the p.498Q>K
mutation. Comparatively, the p.498Q>E mutation can lead to a hydrogen bond
formation between SGlu498 and SGly466 that stabilizes the spike protein, which makes it
less favorable to S-hACE2 interaction (figure 1c).

Low mutation frequencies in hot spot residues may be driven by host specificity
selection
To scan SARS-CoV-2 mutations particularly for those occurring near the spike RBD,
we downloaded all 696 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID at the time of
writing this manuscript to check the number of mutations accumulated across the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. Overall, we observed a dramatically low genetic diversity
within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (figure 2). Moreover, no variants were found in the
hot spot residues. This either suggested (1) the hot spot residues region is highly
conserved during the evolutionary process, or (2) virus strains with reduced

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.077842; this version posted May 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

transmission abilities becomes minorities so that the mutations were not reported in
the consensus genomic sequences. It is also possible that (3) unprecedented variants
in hot spot residues might raise from the insufficient time of mutation accumulation.
To verify (1) and (3), we compared the nucleotide diversity of the hot spot
residue

regions among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, to see if

mutations were reported in the hot spot residues from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV
spike orthologs. The boundary of the hot spot residues for SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV

were

identified

using

the

approach

of

SARS-CoV-2

(supplementary file 1). As expected, we observed variants in both of the hot spot
residues of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (supplementary file 2), which demonstrated
the hot spot residues are not mutation-free. Additionally, we found the SARS-CoV-2
had an overall low nucleotide diversity (supplementary file 2) compared to
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the MERS-CoV had the highest overall nucleotide
diversity among the three viral species. These results further indicated that the relative
short mutation accumulation time is one of the major reasons for the unprecedented
variants in hot spot residue regions, even though COVID-19 has already been spread
globally for several months.
As the key determinant of host specificity, spike protein comprises an N-terminal
S1 subunit and a membrane-embedded C-terminal S2 region, in which the S1 domain
was thought to be more variable than S2 domain normally [3, 23]. Therefore, the
unprecedented variant in hot spot residues regions were likely suffered the host
specificity selection, allowing the stabilized transmissions within species. However,
despite of the negative Tajima’s D in the hot spot residues regions of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV (supplementary file 2), we still cannot exclude the possibility of positive
selection, as the negative Tajima’s D is more likely caused by the expansion of virus
population. Collectively, we didn’t find any mutations in the hot spot residues region
in SARS-CoV-2 in our study, which might be driven by the host specificity selection.

Selection pressure analysis on spike and spike RBD
In spite of the crucial role of host specificity selection in maintaining the transmission

capacity of viruses, adaptive evolution still ubiquitously happened on viral genomes
during animal-to-human transmission and human-to-human transmission [24, 25]. We
analyzed the ratios of the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous changes (dN/dS)
[26] for three coronaviruses with a focus on spike protein and spike RBD. We
detected positive selection in the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 and purifying selection
for both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although only MERS-CoV purifying selection
was statistically significant (p-value<0.001, figure 3). Such observation correlated
with the selection pressure analysis on SARS-CoV spike protein during different
epidemic phases [10] and overall dN/dS ratio reported for MERS-CoV spike protein
[27]. We further inspected the scaled-dN/dS ratio in spike functional domains,
particularly RBD. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike RBD were both under purifying
selection, even though multiple positive selection sites on MERS-CoV spike were
identified during the MERS epidemic [28, 29]. In contrast, the positive scaled-dN/dS
value of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was largely contributed by the region between
RBD and S2 domain. In fact, the scaled-dN/dS for SARS-CoV-2 RBD was below
zero, suggesting that overall the RBD was not under positive selection.

The hot spot residues are more likely to be deleterious when mutation happens
Hu et al. has conducted a genome-wide evolution and variation analysis using 42
complete genome sequences of the SARS-CoV [30]. These include all 32 complete
genome sequences of the SARS-CoV collected from GenBank as of Aug 17th, 2003,
two months after the end of the SARS epidemic, along with 10 genomes sequenced
by Beijing Genomics Institute. We believe these sequences are enough to reflect the
mutation occurrences of SARS-CoV during the emergent pneumonia epidemic in
2003. We utilized the SARS-CoV transition and transversion statistics (reformatted in
supplementary file 3) from this study to infer the probabilities of amino acid changes
for each of the 38 residues listed in table 1, given the homogeneity of SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV. A complete list of mutations and their probabilities are shown in
table S1 (supplementary file 4). Taking Gln498 as an example, based on transition
and transversion rate at each codon phase from SARS-CoV, we estimated that when a

mutation occurs at SARS-CoV-2 SGln498, there is a 15.4% chance to be synonymous,
33.3% chance to be advantageous, 0% chance to be non-synonymous neutral
mutations, and 51.3% chance (with a 17.9% chance of a pre-terminated stop codon
mutation) to be deleterious. We highlighted 19 residues in figure 4 with higher
chances to develop functional mutations (padvantageous+pdeleterious

≥

pneutral) when

non-synonymous mutation happens. It is obvious that the majority of these high
impact mutations are deleterious, suggesting that random mutations of these amino
acids are more likely to decrease the S-hACE2 binding affinity, thereby reducing the
transmission ability of the mutated strain. Such mutations may not be detectable by
sequencing or are likely to be classified as rare mutations that are often excluded in
the consensus genome sequences.
Previously multiple positive selection sites on MERS-CoV spike proteins were
reported during its epidemic. Comparatively, only a limited number of mutations were
identified near the hot spot residue region for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is
challenging to apply the same methods on SARS-CoV-2. Alternatively, we analyzed
possible mutations of the hot spot residues and predicted multiple amino acids that
may under strong positive selection. Specifically, Asp405, Gly446, Tyr449, Gly476,
Tyr495, Gln506 are 6 residues with padvantageous > pdeleterious. These hot spot residues
require closer surveillance, as mutations surged from these sites could indicate
mutated strains with higher transmission abilities.

Analyze hot spot residue mutations from public database
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases grows exponentially as we conducted this
study, with 10 times more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences submitted to GISAID in a
month, reaching over 6,000 sequences as of Apr. 12th, 2020. Instead of collecting the
complete list of publically available sequences that are expected to grow each day, we
chose to verify our prediction with the mutation database from CNCB (the China
National Center for Bioinformation, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/) directly. Among
2,645 mutations, only 22 SNPs were mapped to the hot spot residue region with a
genomic coordinates between 22,769 and 23,080, six of which were synonymous

mutations (c.1518caA>caR was wrongly annotated as non-synonymous mutation. See
supplementary file 5). Apart from the mutations that directly fell into hot spot residues,
we also evaluated the

ΔAffinity value for all amino acid substitutions presented in

hot spot residue region. Figure 5 illustrated that mutations with high number of
strands were either neutral mutations (p.475Q and p.483V>A, with six and 16 strands,
respectively), or advantageous mutations that could potentially increase the virus
transmission (p.476G>S, eight strands). Although the number of strands with the
mutation is not necessarily related to infectivity directly under the pandemic situation,
the fact that variants with higher frequencies were not deleterious could imply that
virus strands with deleterious mutations may exhibit restricted infectivity. On the
other hand, the advantageous p.476G>S mutation was associated with the second
highest number of strands in this region. Whether the high number is caused by
oversampling from the same spread chain or by multiple strains evolved with the
same positively selected strains need further investigation, even though the latter one
seems more probable because incidences were reported from a couple of
geographically distant countries (Belgium and USA) by different institutes.

Material and methods
Hot spot residues identification and mutation analysis
The structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike with hACE2 complex was initially
downloaded from China National Microbiology Data Center (http://nmdc.cn/nCoV)
with an accession number NMDCS0000001 (PDB accession: 6LZG). The analysis
was performed using PyMol [31] (version 2.3.0) and Residue Scanning module of
BioLuminate [32, 33] from Schrödinger suite. Residues on spike receptor binding
domain (RBD) within 6 Å around hACE2 were considered as hot spot residues. The
hot spot residues for SARS-CoV S-hACE2 (PDB accession: 6CS2) and MERS-CoV
S-hDPP4 (PDB accession: 4L72) were identified using the same approach. For
SARS-CoV S-hACE2 analysis, the side-chain prediction with 4.5 Å Cbeta sampling
was selected to perform the side-chain prediction including sampling of the CA-CB

orientation. With one single nucleotide mutation at a time, all possible amino acid
substitutions for each of the hot spot residues were iteratively introduced to the wild
type protein. Residue Scanning of BioLuminate systematically evaluates the binding
affinity of residue mutations in the protein-protein interface.

ΔAffinity parameter was

used as indicators for binding affinity changes of the mutant protein as well as any
other specific chains. Specifically, positive

ΔAffinity values associate with reduced

binding affinity of the mutant spike protein and vice versa. Therefore, amino acid
substitution with

Δ Affinity≥1.5

[22, 34] were defined as deleterious because it

weakens the S-hACE2 interaction and may lead to reduced transmission rate of the
coronavirus. Similarly, substitutions with

Δ Affinity ≤ -1.5

were considered as

advantageous, because enhanced binding may lead to higher viral transmission rate.
Substitutions with

ΔAffinity between -1.5 and 1.5 were labeled as neutral mutations,

since the affinity changes seems to be negligible computationally. We also assigned
Affinity score of 0 for synonymous mutations and

Δ Affinity

Δ

score of 30 for

pre-terminated stop codons for ease of illustration.

Sequence variations and evolution analysis
The complete genome sequences for 696 SARS-CoV-2, 260 SARS-CoV, and 479
MERS-CoV (supplementary file 6) were used to conduct the population genetics and
evolutionary analyses. Sequences for SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded directly from
GISAID database. Sequences for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were queried from
NCBI virus database [35] using the blastn function implemented in BLAST V2.6.0
[36] with their reference genomes (SARS-CoV: NC_004718.3; MERS-CoV:
NC_019843.3), respectively. For sequence variation and evolution analysis, we firstly
performed multiple alignment at genome levels within each species using MAFFT
V7.455 [37]. The alignments were manually inspected and truncated to make sure the
total lengths were consistent with the corresponding reference genome. The

nucleotide diversity and Tajimas’ D value for each virus were calculated using the
PopGenome V2.7.5 package [38] in R. A sliding window approach (window size =
100 bp, jump = 100 bp) was used to this calculation. We then calculated the dN/dS
ratio using SNPGenie [39]. The gene information for the three viruses were extracted
from the corresponding GFF files available in NCBI. The domain information of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (NCBI accession ID: YP_009724390.1) was determined
using Pfam [40] via sequence search.

SARS-CoV-2 mutation probabilities
The occurrences of transition and transversion statistics from this study [30] were
used to calculate per-nucleotide mutation at each codon phase. For instance,
SARS-CoV-2 SGln498 is encoded by a ‘CAA’ triplet. Using IUPAC notation [41], the
probability of ‘CAA’ mutated to ‘CAG’ can be derived from the equation below,

pA  G   ∑

,,

  
   ∑  ,,  



 ∑  ,,  



 

Here A  G  stands for the occurrences of A>G mutation at the third codon
phase. Therefore, we can conclude that if a mutation at SGln498 happens, 15.385% it
will be a synonymous mutation since ‘CAA’ and ‘CAG’ both encode glutamine.

Hot spot residue mutation check
We downloaded a complete list of mutations for SARS-CoV-2 from CNCB on Apr.
12th, 2020. 22 single point mutations between 22,769 and 23,080 were extracted.
Nucleotide substitutions described using IUPAC nomenclature without accurate
annotation were manually curated.

Δ Affinity

of these 22 mutations were also

calculated using BioLuminate if not available. The list of all mutations can be found
in supplementary file 5.

Figure 1

Hot spot residues and the impact of selected mutations to

SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 interaction
SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 complex. (a) Residues from spike protein that are within 6 Å
around hACE2 were labeled and adjusted for better visualization. Two mutations from
the same residue has been chosen to illustrate the impact of the mutations to S-hACE2
interaction. (b) The p.498Q>K mutation breaks the hydrogen bond between SGln498
and hACE2Gln42 (grey dash line) but forms a hydrogen bond between SLys498 and
hACE2Gln42, and a salt bridge between SLys498 and hACE2Asp38, enhancing the binding
interaction. (c) The p.498Q>E mutation results in the loss of the same hydrogen bond
with hACE2Gln42 (grey dash line), in addition to the formation of a hydrogen bond
within the spike receptor binding surface, which is unfavorable for S-hACE2
interaction.
Figure 2 Genome wide SNP distribution
SNPs were called from multiple sequence alignment result and mapped to its genomic
locations. 68% of the mutations are found in ORF1ab coding region. There are few
mutations identified in spike protein, however, none of these mutations are in the hot
spot region.

Comparison of dN/dS for major genes and spike protein domains of

SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV
(a) The scaled dN/dS value of five major genes. ORF1ab and N were under purifying
selection in all three species. For spike protein, only SARS-CoV-2 spike was under
positive selection. (b) However, the positive scaled-dN/dS value was mainly
contributed by two non-domain regions, that is region 1, which is on the 5’ end of
RBD, and region 2, which is between RBD and S2 domain. Due to limited number of
mutations identified so far, none of the scaled-dN/dS values for these regions/domains
were statistically significant. It is worth mentioning that the spike RBD for
MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were under purifying selection with statistical
significance, suggesting the coronavirus spike RBD are usually under purifying

selection eventually.
Figure 4 Functional mutation probabilities and the impact of the mutations of
19 selected residues
Residues from the hot spot residues were selected if they are more likely to develop a
functional impact on SARS-CoV-2 S-hACE2 interaction. Possible mutations of each
residue is plotted in scatter plot separately, with each dot represent a unique amino
acid substitution, colored by its downstream impact. For each dot, the x-axis is the
predicted mutation probability and the y-axis is the

Δaffinity in log-scale.

Overall,

the number of red dots (deleterious mutations) are higher than the green
(advantageous mutations) and grey (neutral mutations) dots, suggesting that these
mutations are more likely to have deleterious mutations. However, dots from Asp405,
Gly446, Tyr449, Gly476, Tyr495 and Gln506 were mostly green, indicating higher
chances of developing advantageous mutations when these residues mutated.
Figure 5 Mutation distribution on hot spot residue region using latest mutation
statistics
Hot spot residues (yellow blocks) and six residues mentioned in figure 4 (blue blocks)
were mapped to the amino acid positions of the spike protein. The wild type amino
acid sequences and the mutations identified in this region are aligned together in
Amino Acids and Known Mutations track. For each mutation, the number of strands
with the mutation is plotted in the bar chart track. Boxes with numbers in the last
track can be projected to the x-axis to track the

Δaffinity

of the corresponding

mutations. Deleterious, neutral, and advantageous mutations are filled with red, grey
and blue in the last two tracks, respective.

predicted impact. Among these residues, several of them were less relevant to the
spike-hACE2 binding. For instance, mutations on 474Gln, 479Pro, 490Phe and
492Leu were all predicted as neutral. Moreover, 487Asn seems to be a crucial residue
because all non-synonymous mutations are deleterious. In contrast, none of the
residues only contain advantageous mutations.
