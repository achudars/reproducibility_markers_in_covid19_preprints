Abstract
The UK variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), known as
B.1.1.7, harbors several point mutations and deletions on the spike (s) protein, which potentially
alter its structural epitopes to evade host immunity while enhancing host receptor binding. Here
we report the cryo-EM structures of the S protein of B.1.1.7 in its apo form and in the receptor
ACE2-bound form. One or two of the three receptor binding domains (RBDs) were in the open
conformation but no fully closed form was observed. In the ACE-bound form, all three RBDs
were engaged in receptor binding. The B.1.1.7-specific A570D mutation introduced a salt bridge
switch that could modulate the opening and closing of the RBD. Furthermore, the N501Y
mutation in the RBD introduced a favorable p-p interaction manifested in enhanced ACE2
binding affinity. The N501Y mutation abolished the neutralization activity of one of the three
potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Cryo-EM showed that the cocktail of other two nAbs
simultaneously bound to all three RBDs. Furthermore, the nAb cocktail synergistically
neutralized different SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus strains, including the B.1.1.7.

Introduction
The emergence of the United Kingdom (UK) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), B.1.1.7, also known as the Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01
strain, was first identified in southeastern UK in December 20201. B.1.1.7 was significantly more
transmissible than the other SARS-CoV-2 variants across UK, with an estimated increase of the
reproduction number, also known as R0, by 0.4 to 0.72. B.1.1.7 quickly spread across the world,
resulting in a surge of infected cases, and consequently stringent travel restrictions and national
lockdowns in many countries. B.1.1.7 is defined by 23 genetic mutations compared to the original
strain in Wuhan. In addition to the asparagine (D) to glycine (G) mutation at position 614 (D614G)
of the surface spike (S) protein, which has dominated the reported COVID-19 cases since the
summer of 2020 (GISIAD database: https://www.gisaid.org), B.1.1.7 harbors eight additional
mutations within the S protein. Of particular interest is the asparagine (N) to tyrosine (Y) mutation
at position 501 (N501Y), located at the receptor binding motif (RBM) that is involved in direct
physical interactions with the human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate viral
entry into host cells3,4. While the functional implications of the remaining mutations remain to be
established, the deletion of histidine 69 and valine 70 (DH69/V70) within the amino terminal
domain (NTD) of the S protein is also present in the Danish SARS-CoV-2 mink-associated
variant that caused zoonotic transmissions to infect humans, leading the culling of over 17 million
minks in November 20205. Although most neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that have been
identified from convalescent plasma mostly target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S
protein to sterically prevent its engagement with ACE2, several nAbs were reported to target the
NTD without blocking ACE2 binding6-12. In particular, tyrosine 144 of the S protein, which is
deleted in B.1.1.7, is part of the structural epitope of the NTD-specific antibody 4A8. Indeed, a
recent study shows that the DY144 deletion strongly diminishes the binding by multiple NTDderived nAbs, including 4A8, by more than 1000-fold, suggesting that the increased
infectiousness of B.1.1.7 is associated with its ability to evade host immunity13.
Results
Overall structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-UK (B.1.1.7)
We determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the ectodomain of
the S protein of B.1.1.7 (hereafter S-UK) and identified four distinct conformations by threePage 3 of 20

dimensional variability (3DAV) analysis (Figure 1). Three of the conformation classes
corresponded to one upward RBD (RBD-up) conformation (their nominal resolutions ranged
between 3.2 and 3.6 Å), and the remaining one corresponded to two RBD-up conformation with
a nominal resolution of 3.3 Å (Figure 1B and Supporting Information Fig. S1). Collectively, the
one RBD-up conformations accounted for 73 % of the overall population and the two RBD-up
conformation accounted for the remaining 27 %. Due to the intrinsic dynamics, the loop regions
in the NTD where the DH69/V70 and DY144 lie, as well as the P681H mutation in the furin
cleavage site could not be resolved with clarity in the cryo-EM maps. The remaining mutation
sites, namely N501Y, A570D, D614G, T716I, S982A and D1118H, could be unambiguously
resolved to build the atomic models accordingly (Supporting Information Fig. S2). Despite the
large number of mutations, the overall structure of S-UK did not differ significantly from that of
the original Wuhan strain and the D614G variant (hereafter S-WT and S-D614G, respectively),
except for the relative populations and the number of the RBD-up conformation, which have
direct implication in host recognition through binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)4,14-20.
Regulation of RBD orientation by a “pedal bin” mechanism unique to B.1.1.7
RBD-up conformation is the pre-requisite for ACE2 binding. Of all the reported cryo-EM
structures of S-WT solved under physiological conditions (neutral pH), the majority exhibit an all
RBD-down state with some in a single RBD-up state16,21,22. In contrast, the reported cryo-EM
structures of S-D614G exhibit a higher propensity to populate RBD-up states with the majority
being in one RBD-up state and some in two RBD-up state17-20. Our recent study indicated that
none of the observed S-D614G particles were in an all RBD-down state, while 62 % of which
had one RBD-up and 38 % had two RBD-up state23. Similar to S-D614G, S-UK did not populate
all RBD-down state. Nevertheless, relative to S-D614G, S-UK exhibited less two RBD-up state
(27 %) and predominantly populated the one RBD-up state (73 %) (Figure 1B). Gamblin and coworkers postulated that a salt bridge formed by D614 and K854 from two different protomers
within the trimeric assembly is a linchpin to restrict inter-protomer motions to maintain RBD-down
states. The D614G mutation abrogates the D614-K854 salt bridge thereby promoting RBD-up
states19,22.
Close examination of the cryo-EM structure of S-UK indicated that the B.1.1.7-specific
A570D mutation lies in close proximity to the D614G mutation site. The central helix in which

K854 and K964 reside is flanked by D614G and A570D from the other protomer (Figure 2). The
cryo-EM structure of S-UK in an RBD-up state exhibited a new salt bridge formed by K854B and
A570DA, accompanied by another salt bridge between K964B and D571A adjacent to A570D
(Figure 2A, bottom panel). In contrast, the cryo-EM structure of S-UK in an RBD-down state
exhibited an alternative salt bridge between K964C and A570DB (Figure 2A, top panel). These
additional salt bridges likely compensate the loss of the salt bridge between D614 and K854 due
to the D614G mutation. Comparison of the RBD-up and RBD-down conformations within the
same S-UK structure revealed a 30º rotation of the RBD relative to the pivot point defined by the
center of mass (COM) of the SD2 domain. In contrast, a minor rotation of the N-terminal domain
(NTD) by 7º was observed (Figure 2B). The rigid body domain motion resulted in an upward
displacement of 22 Å of the COM of RBD with a concomitant downward displacement of 3 Å of
the COM of SD2 while the central helix remained static. Note that the downward displacement
of SD2 was essentially governed by the downward loop movement promoted by the switch of
salt bridge pairing that involves the A570D mutation. We propose that the switching of the
A570D-mediated salt bridges may serve as the pedal of a pedal bin-like mechanism to modulate
the RBD motion.
Molecular basis of ACE2 recognition by S-UK
To glean structural insights into the receptor binding of S-UK, we determined the cryoEM structure of S-UK in complex with the ectodomain of ACE2 fused to a super-fold green
fluorescence protein (hereafter ACE2). The 3DVA analysis of the complex demonstrated that all
three RBDs of S-UK were bound to ACE2 in a 3:3 stoichiometry as opposed to the previously
reported heterogeneous binding stoichiometry between the S protein of the Wuhan variant
(hereafter S-WT) and ACE2 (Figure 3A-B and Supporting Information Fig. S3)4,24,25. Furthermore,
the local orientation of the RBD in complex with ACE2 shows structurally dynamic, leading to
the weak density and poor resolution (> 4.5 Å) of this region (Supporting Information Fig. S3).
To this end, we therefore carried out the local refinement with a mask focusing on the RBD and
ACE2 to result in a density map of 3.5 Å (Supporting Information Fig. S3). The improved
resolution of the region favors us to confidently build the atomic model to uncover the binding
interface between RBD and ACE2. Detailed inspection revealed a newly formed p-p stacking
between the mutated Y501 of S-UK and Y41 of ACE2, which could potentially provide additional
stability of the complex formation (Figure 3C). Furthermore, a contracted rigid-body domain

movement of ACE2 towards the RBD of S-UK relative to that of S-WT by 2.5 Å was observed
(defined by the COM displacement of ACE2).
To evaluate the impact of the B.1.1.7-specific mutations on the binding of ACE2, we
immobilized ACE2 onto the sensor tips for biolayer interferometry (BLI) and compared the
binding kinetics to S-UK and S-D614G. A two-fold decrease of the dissociation constant (Kd) of
S-UK (Kd = 1.3 nM) compared to that of the D614G variant (Kd = 3.1 nM) was observed (Figure
3D). The main difference was the reduced off-rate of S-UK (1.1x10-4 s-1) compared to that of SD614G (5.3x10-5 s-1). Considering the slow dissociation kinetics of the binding event that could
contribute to the uncertainty of the kinetic measurements, the effect of the N501Y mutation
appeared to make marginal impact on the ACE2 binding kinetics.
The N501Y mutation helps evade some but not all neutralizing antibodies
In spite of the marginal difference in ACE2 binding, the mutations in S-UK could help
SARS-CoV-2 evade neutralizing antibodies to achieve higher infectivity13. To address this issue,
we tested the abilities of three chimeric anti-RBD antibodies (RBD-chAbs) to compete with ACE2
binding to S-UK. We recently demonstrated that the three RBD-chAbs, namely RBD-chAb15, 25
and 45, targeted three distinct sites within the RBM, that each of these RBD-chAbs potently
neutralize pseudovirus of the original Wuhan strain of SARS-CoV-2, and that the cocktail of
RBD-chAb25 and 45 can prophylactically protect mice and hamsters from SARS-CoV-2
infection26. BLI analysis showed that pre-incubation of S-D614G with each of the three RBDchAbs effectively prevented ACE2 binding. However, RBD-chAb25 failed to compete ACE2
binding to S-UK while RBD-chAb15 and 45 remained highly effective ACE2 binding inhibitors
(Figure 4A-C). The loss of neutralizing activity of RBD-chAb25 against S-UK can be rationalized
by the overlap of its structural epitope and the N501Y mutation evidenced by our recent cryoEM analysis (Figure 3C and Supporting Information Fig. S4). Instead, epitope mapping of RBDchAb15 and 45 reside on two distal ends of RBM thus potentially allowing simultaneous binding
to the same RBD. To verify our hypothesis, we sequentially mixed RBD-chAb45 and 15 with SD614G shortly before cryo-EM grid vitrification, and determined the cryo-EM structure of the
quaternary complex (S-D614G:RBD-chAb15/45). The resulting cryo-EM map revealed
stoichiometric binding of RBD-chAb15 and 45 to all three RBDs, and the N501 was bypassed
by the two RBD-chAbs (Figure 4D-E). Despite the limited space above the three upward pointing
RBDs to accommodate six antibodies, the poses of RBD binding by the two RBDs were

essentially identical to that of individually bound cryo-EM structures, underscoring their potential
to be used as a cocktail therapy for B.1.1.7.
To verify our hypothesis, we generated two pseudoviruses that individually expressed SD614G and S-UK on the viral surface, and tested their pseudovirus neutralization activity of
RBD-chAb15 and 45 in isolation and in combination (cocktail). The results showed that both
nAbs were more effective against the D614G strain (Figure 4J) over the B.1.1.7 strain (Figure
4K), and that the cocktail of equal amounts of RBD-chAb15 and 45 was significantly more
effective than the separately used nAbs.
Discussion
In summary, we showed that the B.1.1.7-specific mutations minimally perturb the overall
structure of the trimeric assembly of S-UK while a shift in the population of upward pointing RBD
was observed. Compared to S-D614G, the two RBD-up population of S-UK was reduced without
populating all RBD-down state. We identified a unique salt bridge switch involving the B.1.1.7specific A570D mutation with two lysine residues, K854 and K964, in the central helix to
compensate the loss of the salt bridge between D614 and K854 due to the D614G mutation. We
postulate that the newly evolved A570D mutation serves as a molecular switch in a pedal bin
mechanism to kinetically modulate the up/down motion of RBD. The RBD-up state is stabilized
by the double salt bridge – A570D-K854 and D571-K964 – thereby increasing the kinetic barrier
for the RBD-up to return to the RBD-down state relative to S-D614G. A recent report shows that
introducing the A570D mutation to S-D614G leads to increased sensitivity of three RBD-upspecific antibodies, thus leading support to our proposed regulatory mechanism achieved by the
A570D mutation13. Furthermore, our S-UK:ACE2 structure adopts a 3:3 binding stoichiometry
unlike previously reported cryo-EM structures of ACE2-bound S-WT, the majority of which
display a single RBD-up engaged with ACE2 binding4,24,25. This serves as additional evidence
to support our conjecture that the A570D mutation helps stabilize the RBD-up state.
Increased RBD-up population helps host receptor binding at the expenses of increased
probability of being targeted by nAbs. The N501Y mutation in S-UK introduces p-p staking
between N501Y and Y41 of ACE2, according to our cryo-EM structure of S-UK. This translates
into increased binding affinity between S-UK and ACE2 compared to that between S-D614G
and ACE2 according to our BLI measurements. In the context of antibody neutralizing, S-UK
harbors the N501Y mutation within RBM to disrupt binding by a subset of neutralizing antibodies,

including RBD-chAb25 in our case. Nevertheless, RBD-chAb15 and 45 remained highly
neutralizing in the context of competing ACE2 binding (Figure 4A-G). The quaternary cryo-EM
structure of S-D614G:RBD-chAb15/45 showed that the two antibodies can simultaneously bind
to the same RBD without contacting the N501Y mutation site. The pseudovirus assay further
demonstrated that the combined use of RBD-chAb15 and 45 can synergistically neutralize
pseudoviruses that correspond to D614G and B.1.1.7 (Figure 4J-K).
RBD-chAb45 targets the tip of the RBM where F486 resides. Statistical analysis of
reported SARS-CoV-2 S protein bound to convalescence plasma-derived nAbs indicated that
F486 is one of the most targeted RBD residues (Figure 4I). The adjacent E484K mutation that
is present in the emerging South African 501.v2 strain and the Brazilian P1 strain could
potentially reduce the efficacy of RBD-chAb45. Several point mutations are also reported to be
partially overlapping with the high-frequency nAb epitopes, which could impede their neutralizing
activities (Figure 4H). Nevertheless, the structural epitope of RBD-chAb15 is less frequently
recognized by convalescence plasma-derived nAbs and there is hitherto no mutation in the more
transmissible emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that are located within the epitope of RBD-chAb15
(Figure 4G). Therefore, the ability of RBD-chAb15 and 45 to simultaneously bind to distinct
regions of RBD is therefore an attractive feature for considering their use in prophylactic cocktail
antibody therapy to prevent mutational viral escape.

cells for recombinant protein production as described previously28. The recombinant proteins

were affinity purified by overnight binding to HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.
S. A.) in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole and 0.02% NaN3 at
4ºC), followed by washing with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM
imidazole), and elution by buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole).
The eluted protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a sizeexclusion column (Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare, U. S. A.) in TN buffer (50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02 % NaN3). The protein concentrations were determined
by using the UV absorbance at 280 nm using an UV-Vis spectrometer (Nano-photometer N60,
IMPLEN, Germany).
Expression and purification of sfGFP-ACE2
The sfGFP-ACE2 construct was obtained from Addgene (Plasmid #145171), which was
deposited by Erik Proco (University of Illinois, USA)29. Recombinant sfGFP-ACE2 was
transiently expressed in Expi293 cell and secreted into the culture medium. sfGFP-ACE2 was
purified by an ion exchange column (HiTrap 5 ml Q FF anion exchange chromatography column;
GE Healthcare, U. S. A.) eluted by a linear salt gradient from 10 to 1000 mM NaCl, followed by
SEC using a size-exclusion column (Superdex 75 16/600 GL; GE Healthcare, U. S. A.) in TN
buffer. The protein concentrations were determined by using the UV absorbance at 280 nm using
an UV-Vis spectrometer (Nano-photometer N60, IMPLEN, Germany).
Preparation of S-UK in complex with sfGFP-ACE2
Three microliters of S-UK in 2.3 mg/ml was mixed with 1.2 equivalent of sfGFP-ACE2 (SUK:sfGFP-ACE2) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr before being separated by SEC
using a size-exclusion column (Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare, U. S. A.) in TN
buffer. The elution peak corresponding to S-UK in complex with sfGFP-ACE2 was collected and
concentrated to 1.5 mg/ml for cryo-EM grid preparation.
Preparation of S-D614G in complex with RBD-chAb cocktail
Three microliters of S-D614G in 1.2 mg/ml was mixed with 1.2 equivalent of RBD-chAb45 and
incubated at room temperature for 1 hr before being separated by SEC using a size-exclusion
column (Superose 6 increase 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare, U. S. A.) in TN buffer. The elution
peak corresponding to S-UK in complex with RBD-chAb45 was collected and concentrated to a
total concentration of 1.5 mg/ml, followed by the addition of 1.2 equivalent RBD-chAb15 (SPage 9 of 20

UK:RBD-chAb15/45) for cryo-EM grid preparation. The preparation of RBD-chAb15 and 45 was
described elsewhere26.
Cryo-EM sample preparation
Three microliters of purified protein samples – S-UK, S-UK:sfGFP-ACE2, and S-UK:RBDchAb15/45 – were applied onto 300-mesh Quantifoil R1.2/1.3 holyed carbon grids. The grids
were glow-charged at 20 mA for 30 s. After 30 s incubation, the grids were blotted for 2.5 s under
4 ºC with 100% humidity, and vitrified using a Vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific, U. S.
A.).
Data acquisition was performed on a 300 keV Titan Krios microscope equipped with a Gatan
K3 direct detector (Gatan, U. S. A.) in the super-resolution mode using EPU software
(ThermoFisher Scientific, U. S. A.). Movies were collected with a defocus range of -0.8 to -2.6
µm at a magnification of 81000 x, resulting in a pixel size of 0.55 Å. A total dose of 50 e-/Å2 was
distributed over 50 frames with an exposure time of 1.8 second. The dataset was collected with
an energy filter (slit width: 15-20 eV) and the dose rate was adjusted to 8 e-/pix/s.
Image processing and 3D reconstruction
All 2x binned super-resolution raw movies were subject to Relion-3.030 with dose-weighting and
5x5 patch-based alignment using GPU-based software MOTIONCOR231. After motion
correction, all corrected micrographs then were transferred to cryoSPARC v2.1432. Contrast
transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed by patch-based CTF. The satisfied exposures,
whose "CTF_fit_to_Res" parameters were between 2.5 and 4 Å, were selected and applied to
particle picking. A small subset of micrographs was used for template-free blob picker. The
picked particles were extracted with a box size of 384 pixels and followed by iterative rounds of
2D classification for filtering junk particles.
For S-UK, approximately 1.3 million particles were picked and classified by ab-initio
reconstruction with C1 symmetry (class = 5), followed by heterogeneous refinement to generate
five distinct classes (class = 5) and non-uniform refinement to generate an initial model. A mask
was generated based on the initial 3D model for 3DVA by cryoSPARC v2 to generate five
clusters of structural ensembles. Particle images corresponding to four of the five clusters were
reextracted, un-binned, and non-uniformly refined with local CTF refinement to yield four cryo-

EM maps with nominal resolutions ranging between 3.1 and 3.6 Å (Supporting Information
Figure S1).
A similar imaging processing workflow was applied for S-UK:sfGFP-ACE2 and S-UK:RBDchAb15/45. For S-UK:sfGFP-ACE2, five clusters of structural ensembles were also generated
by 3DVA, but all particle images (n=463,191) were pooled and refined without symmetry
constrain to yield a 3.3 Å cryo-EM map (Supporting Information Figure S3). The local resolution
analysis was calculated using ResMap33. To improve the local resolution of ACE2 binding
interface, a mask was created to include ACE2 and RBD for local refinement, which yielded a
3.5 Å cryo-EM of the subset of the S-UK:sfGFP-ACE2 structure. For S-UK:RBD-chAb15/45,
approximately 2.3 million particles were picked for iterative 2D classification, which yield 78,790
particles for initial model building and templated particle picking, which generated 108,126
particles for 3D classification into three classes. The largest class (74%) was further refined by
using a C3 symmetry to yield a 4.0 Å cryo-EM map (Supporting Information Figure S4). The local
resolution analysis was calculated using ResMap33.
Model building and refinement
An initial model of S-UK was generated based on PDB ID: 6XM3 by using Swiss-Model34. The
coordinate was divided into individual domains and manually fitted into the cryoEM map in
UCSF-Chimera35, UCSF-ChimeraX36 and Coot37. A similar approach was used for S-UK:sfGFPACE2, for which crystal structure of ACE2 in complex with RBD (PDB accession code 7KMS)
was used as the initial model. For S-UK:RBD-chAb15/45, the previously determined structures
of S-WT in complex with RBD-chAb15 and RBD-chAb45 were used as template for model
building26. After iterative refinements, the coordinate was further processed by real-space
refinement in Phenix38 to attain a convergent model. Based on the role of the N-glycosylation
motif (N-X-S/T), N-linked glycans were built onto asparagine side-chains by using the extension
module “Glyco” within Coot37. The final models were assessed by MolProbity39. Structural
visualization and rendering of structural representations were achieved by using a combination
of UCSF-Chimera, UCSF-ChimeraX and Pymol (Schrodinger Inc. U. S. A.).
Biolayer interferometry (BLI)
A stock solution of sfGFP-ACE2 was diluted to at 10 µg/ml for immobilization onto High Precision
Streptavidin (SAX) biosensors (Sartorius, Germany) in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,

150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.1% BSA) according to manufacture instructions. Stock solutions
of S-D614G and S-UK were serially diluted to 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 nM in assay
buffer for independent binding using an OctetRED 96 biolayer interferometer (ForteBio, USA).
The association and dissociation were monitored over 600 s and 900 s, respectively. The six
independent BLI sensorgrams with different S protein concentrations were baseline-corrected
using double reference, i.e., biosensors without sfGFP-ACE2 were used to collect sensorgrams
with another set of S protein samples to minimize non-specific binding and to extract the actual
responses from the protein-protein interactions. The double reference subtracted data were
globally fit to a 1:1 binding model using Data Analysis v10.0 software (ForteBio, USA). For RBDchAb neutralization analysis, RBD-chAb15, 25 and 45 were individually mixed with an equal
molar ratio of S-D614G or S-UK at a final concentration of 100 nM, and incubated at room
temperature before BLI measurements using the same sfGFP-ACE2-immobilized biosensors
with 400 s of association and 150 s of dissociation. The results were exported and replotted
Prism 9 (GraphPad, USA).
Structure-based statistics of RBD epitope binding frequency
The identification of structural epitopes of convalescent sera-derived RBD-specific nAbs at a
residue-specific level as achieved by using the 'Protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies'
service

PISA

at

the

European

Bioinformatics

Institute

(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html)40. The list of cryo-EM and crystal structures of
nAb-bound spike and RBD was manually curated by searching the entries deposited in the
Protein Data Bank and their corresponding publications as tabulated in Tables S3-S4. The nAb
contacting residues within RBD were defined by the function “Interfaces” of PISA and
summarized in Table S5. In cases where one RBD residue is in contact with both the heavy
chain and a light chain of a given nAb, the epitope count was considered to be twice. The
cumulated epitope counts were mapped onto the crystal structure of RBD in complex with ACE2
(PDB accession code 6M0J) and rendered by using Pymol (Schrodinger Inc. U. S. A.).
Pseudovirus neutralization assay
The pseudovirus neutralization assays were performed using 293T cells overexpressing ACE2
and pseudoviruses expressing full-length S protein provided by RNAi Core of Academic Sinica.
Four-fold serially dilution of chAbs were premixed with 1000 TU/well D614G, UK or SA strain of

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then added to preseeded 293T-ACE2 cells at 100 μl/well for 24 h at 37°C. The medium was removed and refilled
with 100 μl/well DMEM for additional 48-h incubation. Next, 100 μl ONE-Glo™ luciferase reagent
(Promega) was added to each well for 3-min incubation at 37°C. The luciferase activities were
measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The inhibition rate was
calculated by comparing the luminescence value to the negative and positive control wells. IC50
was determined by a four-parameter logistic regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad
Software Inc.).

Figure legends
Figure 1. Cryo-EM structures of S-UK. (A) Domain structure of S-UK labeled with the nine
B.1.1.7 mutations. The D614G mutation that is common in most emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains
is highlighted in blue. (B) Four different classes of conformations of S-UK derived from cryo-EM
3DVA. The relative populations of the individual classes are indicated in the pie chart and the
number of RBD in the upward conformation (RBD-up) of each class is indicated below the top
view along with the nominal resolution in parenthesis. The positions of the RBD-up are indicated
by red asterisks.
Figure 2. Molecular switch of regulating the RBD orientation. Structural basis of the interprotomer interaction networks around the clinical mutation sites for RBD-up (A) and RBD-down
(B). Inset on the upper left corner of each panel illustrates the overall conformation of one
protomer with the mutation site of interest indicated by a box, which is expanded in the
corresponding panel. The RBD-up and RBD-down protomers are colored in light blue (chain A)
and pink (chain B), respectively. For RBD-down, the corresponding protomer, chain B, is
interacting with another RBD-down protomer, chain C, which is color in light green. (C)
Comparison of the relative domain orientations of RBD-up and RBD-down in the context of the
clinical mutations. The centers of mass of NTD (residues 1-288), RBD (residues 330-525), SD2
(residues 317-329 and 526-588), and SD1 (residues 290-316 and 589-695) are shown in
spheres over the semitransparent cartoon representations of RBD-up (light blue) and RBD-down
(pink). The two mutated residues, D614G and A570D, along with D571 on the same protomer,
and K854 and K964 on the other protomer (indicated by an apostrophe) are shown in spheres.
The alpha helix and the preceding loop in which K854’ and K964’ reside are shown in a cartoon
representation and colored in green. Schematic representations of the domain motions of RBDup (D) and RBD-down (E) modulated by the inter-protomer salt bridges. A switch in salt bridge
pairing between K964’ and D571/A570D is proposed to regulate the pedal bin-like motions of
RBD and Domain D.

S-UK-bound ACE2 is colored magenta. For comparison, the RBD of S-WT in complex with ACE2
is shown in grey. The N501Y mutation within the RBD introduced an additional pi-pi interaction
with Y41 of ACE2 that could strength the intermolecular interaction. BLI sensorgrams of S-WT

concentrations of S-D614G and S-UK used in the independent BLI binding assays are indicated
on the right. The kinetic parameters derived from global fitting of the sensorgrams are shown
above with the fitted data shown in red lines that overlaid with the experimental curves.
Figure 4. Neutralization of ACE2 binding by RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies. BLI
sensorgrams of immobilized ACE2 binding to S-D614G and S-UK, both of which were
preincubated with RBD-chAb15 (A), RBD-chAb25 (B), and RBD-chAb45 (C). The sensorgrams
of S-D614G and S-UK are shown in orange and indigo, respectively. Only S-UK preincubated
with RBD-chAb25 showed significant ACE2 binding, indicating the loss of neutralizing capacity
of RBD-chAb25 as a result of the N501Y mutation. The grey arrow indicates the time point at
which the dissociation of the complex was triggered. Schematic illustration of the experimental
design is shown in (A). (D) Orthogonal views of the cryo-EM map of S-D614G in complex with
RBD-chAb15 and 45 in a 3:3:3 binding stoichiometry. The three RBDs are shown in blue, the
