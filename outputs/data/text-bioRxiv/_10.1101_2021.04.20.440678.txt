Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need for exploring different diagnostic and
therapeutic modalities to tackle future viral threats. In this vein, we propose the idea of sen‐
tinel cells, cellular biosensors capable of detecting viral antigens and responding to them with
customizable responses. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a test case, we developed a live cell sensor
(SARSNotch) using a de novo-designed protein binder against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike pro‐
tein. SARSNotch is capable of driving custom genetically-encoded payloads in immortalized
cell lines or in primary T lymphocytes in response to purified SARS-CoV-2 Spike or in the
presence of Spike-expressing cells. Furthermore, SARSNotch is functional in a cellular system
used in directed evolution platforms for development of better binders or therapeutics. In
keeping with the rapid dissemination of scientific knowledge that has characterized the in‐
credible scientific response to the ongoing pandemic, we extend an open invitation for others
to make use of and improve SARSNotch sentinel cells in the hopes of unlocking the potential
of the next generation of smart antiviral therapeutics.
Introduction
The astoundingly rapid scientific response to
the global COVID-19 pandemic is built on
decades of basic scientific research. Sus‐
tained exploration of currently available ther‐
apeutic modalities as well as the generation
of new treatment approaches through re‐
search investments in blue-sky technologies
is necessary to combat future threats. Engi‐
neered live-cell therapies, in which cells are
programmed to find sites of infection or dis‐
ease and deliver precisely targeted thera‐
peutic interventions, are promising platforms
to robustly respond to a myriad of future
threats.
Current cell-based therapies are primarily
focused on treating cancer, although a vari‐
ety of potential applications are currently un‐
der exploration1–3. The tools available to pro‐
gram these therapies are also rapidly evolv‐
ing, with considerable work dedicated to im‐
proving the cellular circuits that confer tar‐
geting specificity against cancer 4–7.
Progress has been fueled by investments in
synthetic biology tools that are capable of
functioning orthogonally or in parallel with
natural cellular systems8–10. A particularly ex‐
citing opportunity resides in the rise of de
novo-designed proteins as in silico and on

demand building blocks for cellular engi‐
neering11–16. Consequently, there is consider‐
able potential in combining live cell plat‐
forms, synthetic biology and protein design
to build modular and rapidly adaptable tools
to combat emerging threats.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus at the root of the
COVID-19 pandemic has become a proving
ground for nascent technologies. At the
forefront, multiple vaccines17,18 have been
developed based on the decades-old prom‐
ise of mRNA therapeutics19. Additionally,
testing facilities have been rapidly deployed
to confront growing case numbers20 and
CRISPR-based strategies have been applied
for viral detection and neutralization21. Even
further, neutralizing proteins with potential
therapeutic uses have been developed, in‐
cluding synthetic nanobodies22 and de novodesigned protein binders23. This work is a
testament to decades of basic research in
synthetic biology, and pioneering work in
coronavirus biology that made the SARSCoV-2 S antigen, or Spike protein, amenable
to structural studies24–27.
Using SARS-CoV-2 as a test case, we
propose a class of engineered cells capable
of serving as sentinels that can detect and
respond to virus-infected cells . To achieve

this proof of principle, we combined the
malleable synthetic Notch receptor (Syn‐
Notch) platform for generating customizable
genetic responses to detected antigens10,28
with de novo-designed anti-Spike binders23
to create engineered cells that detect the
presence of the Spike protein. We demon‐
strate that these sentinel cells can detect
purified Spike protein and a model of in‐
fected cells that are expressing Spike, and
we show that this sensing approach is por‐
table between different cell types, including
primary human T lymphocytes and adherent
cells. We suggest that this system, when
coupled with appropriate therapeutic pay‐
loads, represents a potential next-generation
targeted therapeutic against future patho‐
genic threats.
Results
SARSNotch combines de novo designed
protein binders and SynNotch to detect
SARS-CoV-2 Spike
We sought to develop a sentinel cell capable
of sensing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,
either on its own or when displayed by in‐
fected cells. Our ideal system would feature
a swappable antigen-sensing domain, for
use against a potentially rapidly evolving tar‐
get, and a customizable genetic response.
The modular SynNotch receptor10,28 provided
a suitable platform for these requirements. A
SynNotch receptor comprises an extracellular sensor domain that recognizes a desired
epitope, fused to a user-defined cleavable intracellular domain that retains a transcription
factor (TF) at the membrane. Antigen recognition induces the cleavage of a TF, which
translocates into the nucleus to activate output expression (Figure 1A). Notably, Syn‐
Notch has previously been used to success‐
fully detect the hepatitis B virus (HBV)29, thus
we were optimistic that it could be adapted
for use as an extracellular sensor to detect
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and generate
a customizable transcriptional output upon
this detection.
For the transcriptional output, we used the
well established Gal4p-VP64 hybrid tran‐
scription factor upstream of a promoter con‐
taining a 5X tandem GAL4 DNA activating
sequence and a ybTATA core promoter
((5X)UAS-ybTATA)28,30. For the extracellular
sensor, we initially identified Spike’s endoge‐
nous target, the extracellular domain of hu‐
man ACE225,26. We also explored the use of
de novo designed binders against the Spike
2 | bioRχiv

protein as potential antigen sensors. A com‐
putational campaign was conducted to
identify short protein sequences that were
able to bind the Spike protein23, and we in‐
corporated the lead candidate from this
screen (LCB1) into our initial antigen sensor
panel (Figure 1A). Using our Mammalian
Cloning Toolkit31, we rapidly constructed
multiple SynNotch variants with these differ‐
ent extracellular sensors for Spike.
We started with a polyclonal Jurkat cell
line expressing an output circuit consisting
of mCitrine as a transduction marker and
TagBFP downstream of (5X)UAS-ybTATA,
and then transduced these cells with
lentivirus encoding for either ACE2-Notch or
LCB1-Notch (Supplementary Figure 1A).
We sorted for a polyclonal cell population
expressing these SynNotch variants on their
surface (Supplementary Figure 1B). We
then cultured these cells in a 96-well plate
pre-coated with different concentrations of
purified Spike trimer, and assayed for activa‐
tion via flow cytometry (Figure 1B).
Since TagBFP can only be expressed in
these cells via free Gal4p-VP64 released af‐
ter SynNotch activation, we assessed func‐
tionality by assaying TagBFP expression as
a function of Spike concentration (Figure
1C, Supplementary Figure 1D). We quanti‐
tatively characterized activation using mix‐
ture models to separate active cells from in‐
active cells in our cytometry histograms
(Figure 1D, schematized in Supplemental
Figure 1C, see Methods for detail). Cells ex‐
pressing only the output transcriptional cir‐
cuit but not SynNotch (No Notch) showed
no change in expression in response to in‐
creasing Spike concentrations. To our sur‐
prise, ACE2-Notch was not appreciably acti‐
vated even at large Spike concentrations,
despite showing higher basal activation than
the No Notch background. Remarkably
however, LCB1-Notch showed robust acti‐
vation, with 5-fold increase in mean TagBFP
expression with as little as 0.3µg/ml Spike, a
20-50-fold increase for 1 and 3.16µg/ml
Spike, and a slight decay in activation with a
20-fold increase in expression at 10µg/ml
Spike. With its useful response characteris‐
tics, we dubbed LCB1-Notch SARSNotch
and pursued its characterization further.
For sentinel cells to be useful therapeu‐
tics, it’s important that the sensing circuitry
works in cells that are amenable to use for in
vivo therapies. Traditional SynNotch designs

as blood tumor antigens like CD19 have
been thoroughly tested in therapeutically rel‐
evant cells and in animal models10,32,33. How‐
ever, none of these previous SynNotch vari‐
ants have included a de novo-designed anti‐
gen sensor. To ensure SARSNotch functions
in therapeutically relevant cells, we trans‐
duced primary human CD4+ T lymphocytes
(T Cells) with the output circuit and
SARSNotch and assessed SARSNotch
function in the purified spike assay. T Cells
expressing SARSNotch showed a similar
dose range of activation, albeit with higher
basal activation in comparison to Jurkats
(Figure 1E and 1F, Supplementary Figure
1E). These data establish SARSNotch’s po‐
tential utility in cell-based therapeutics. Fur‐
ther, it confirms that de novo designed pro‐
tein binders may be a promising modular
class of antigen sensors for SynNotch.
SARSNotch can detect Spike protein with
high sensitivity when surface expressed
in a model of infected cells
We next sought to test SARSNotch activa‐
tion in the presence of infected cells. Al‐
though the majority of Spike in infected cells
is packaged into virions, Spike escapes
along the biosynthetic pathway to be cellsurface displayed34–36. To model these in‐
fected cells with Spike on the cell surface,
we generated a line of K562 cells expressing
the perfusion stabilized Spike ectodomain37
tethered to the PDGFR transmembrane do‐
main (Spike-K562s, Figure 2A, Supplemen‐
tary Figure 2A and 2B). We then co-cul‐
tured these cells at varying densities with
SARSNotch-expressing Jurkat sentinels
(Supplementary Figure 2C) and again as‐
sessed SARSNotch activation via TagBFP
expression.
SARSNotch sentinel cells detected the
presence of Spike-K562s (Figure 2B) at rel‐
ative concentrations as low as 0.1 SpikeK562s per sentinel and reached saturation
around 1 Spike-K562 per sentinel (Figure
2C and Supplementary Figure 2E). To as‐
sess the kinetics of the cell-sensing re‐
sponse, we plated Spike-K562s at approxi‐
mately 1 Spike-K562 cell per sentinel and
then assayed for activation at 24, 48, and 72
hours. We saw 20% of cells activated after
24 hours, increasing to 60% activated at 72
hours, suggesting a relatively rapid and sus‐
tained response of sentinels to the presence
of Spike expressing cells (Supplementary
Figure 2D).

We next tested SARSNotch T cells in the
same cell-cell activation assay. T Cell
SARSNotch sentinels showed a strong re‐
sponse to Spike-K562 cells even at low den‐
sities of Spike-K562 cells (Figure 2D). All T
Cell sentinels, even those expressing No
Notch, showed some activation in response
to co-culture with K562s (Figure 2D, Sup‐
plementary Figure 2F), but the specific ac‐
tivation seen in SARSNotch-expressing T
Cell sentinels in response to Spike-K562s
was at least 2-fold greater than the non-spe‐
cific activation for all K562 plating densities.
These data confirm the ability of T Cell sen‐
tinels to sense cell-expressed Spike protein.
SARSNotch does not increase suscepti‐
bility to viral infection
We next wanted to confirm that SARSNotch
sentinel cells are not themselves a target for
viral infection. Sentinel susceptibility to in‐
fection could be a dramatic weakness for an
in vivo therapeutic as it could affect thera‐
peutic cell survival and therefore treatment
half-life, or in worst case scenarios it could
enable sentinels to serve as viral reservoirs
instead of therapeutics.
To test infection susceptibility, we gener‐
ated lentiviruses encoding luciferase that
were pseudotyped with either Spike, vesicu‐
lar stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG), or
no glycoprotein (Figure 3A). We then incu‐
bated dilutions of the pseudotyped virus
with SARSNotch sentinels or as a control,
with a HEK293T cell line stably expressing
the SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 that are susceptible to SARSCoV-2 infection (293T-Susceptible). After 72
hours, we assayed cells for luciferase activ‐
ity in both SARSNotch sentinels and 293TSusceptible cells to evaluate for susceptibil‐
ity to infection.
All cell types showed strong luminescence
following infection with the positive control
VSVG pseudovirus after 72 hours (Figure
3B, raw data in Supplementary Figure 3A),
and even as early as 24 hours (Supplemen‐
tary Figure 3B and 3C). As expected, 293TSusceptible cells were also infected in a
dose dependent manner by the SARS-CoV2 Spike pseudotyped virus. However, neither
Jurkats alone nor our SARSNotch-express‐
ing sentinels were susceptible to the SARSCoV-2 Spike pseudotyped virus, showing no
luminescence. This result demonstrates that
our sentinel cells would not become viral
reservoirs in vivo.

Although we designed SARSNotch sen‐
tinel cells mostly with the goal of detecting,
and in future work acting on, infected cells
displaying viral proteins, we also sought to
determine whether viral particles (virions)
themselves can be detected. Given the pre‐
viously demonstrated inability of SynNotch
to detect soluble ligands28, we hypothesized
that SARSNotch would not be able to detect
pseudotyped viral particles. Indeed, after in‐
cubating SARSNotch sentinels with pseudo‐
typed virus as described above, we did not
detect an increase in TagBFP expression for
any dose of the pseudotyped virus at any
time point assayed after infection (Supple‐
mentary Figure 4A and B). Like
SARSNotch, ACE2-Notch was also unable
to detect virions (Supplementary Figure
4C).

SARSNotch shows dramatic activation in
adherent cells
In addition to their potential uses as cell
therapies, we envision that sentinel cells can
enable an array of technologies to combat
future threats. The ability to produce cus‐
tomized genetic responses to binding
events positions sentinel cells as a poten‐
tially important reagent to generate better
binders against SARS-CoV-2 Spike se‐
quence variants or to rapidly generate opti‐
mized binders for other viruses using di‐
rected evolution systems. As a proof of prin‐
ciple for this use case, we investigated the
functionality of SARSNotch in BHK-21 cells,
a cell type relevant for the rapid mammalian
directed evolution system VEGAS38.
To explore this possibility, we established
a line of BHK-21 sentinels expressing
SARSNotch, as well as the transcriptional

output circuit (Supplementary Figure 5).
We assayed SARSNotch activation in both
purified protein and cell-cell assays for
Spike detection as before. Unlike in Jurkat
sentinels but similar to T Cells, we saw leaki‐
ness in SARSNotch activation in the ab‐
sence of stimulus (Figure 4A). However, de‐
spite this increased basal leakiness,
SARSNotch BHK-21 sentinels showed dra‐
matic activation in the presence of Spike,
without the slight decrease in activation
seen at high doses in the SARSNotch Jurkat
sentinel cells (Figure 4B). A similar pattern
was observed in the cell-cell assay, with al‐
most 100% activation seen when
SARSNotch BHK-21 sentinels were co-cul‐
tured with Spike-K562s at equal density for
72 hours (Figure 4C, 4D). This behavior
highlights the modularity of SARSNotch
across different cellular contexts, and sug‐
gests that there are many as yet unidentified
contexts where this system could be used.
Discussion
In this work, we present SARSNotch, a Syn‐
Notch receptor coupled to a de novo de‐
signed SARS-CoV-2 Spike binder, which en‐
ables sentinel cells to detect Spike protein
on its own or when surface displayed by op‐
posing cells. Sensing is achieved within 24
hours of antigen presentation, and is sensi‐
tive to 0.3µg/ml purified Spike. Activation of
SARSNotch also robustly occurs when
Spike-expressing cells are present at as little
as 1/10th the density of sentinel cells. Cru‐
cially, SARSNotch expression is not suffi‐
cient to increase the susceptibility of sen‐
6 | bioRχiv

tinel cells to SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.
This sensing approach is portable between
different cell types, including primary human
T lymphocytes and adherent cells. This sys‐
tem therefore has the potential to deliver
therapeutic payloads in a live cell-based
therapy. Additionally, it can be used in thera‐
peutic development schemes in vitro.
Selecting an antigen sensor to target a
novel pathogen with SynNotch presents a
unique challenge. All the SynNotch recep‐
tors described so far in the literature rely on
either single chain variable fragment anti‐
bodies (scFvs) or nanobodies to recognize
their antigen. Although both now exist
against SARS-CoV-2 Spike22,39, no such
reagents were available when we embarked
on this project. We first speculated that the
endogenous binder of Spike, ACE2, might
be usable as an antigen sensor. The ACE2Spike interaction is estimated to have a KD
ranging between 1.2 and 22nM24,26,40,41,
whereas the scFv used to target the original
SynNotch to CD19 has a KD of 0.3nM42 and
the scFv successfully used to adapt Syn‐
Notch to target HBV has a KD of ~0.35nM29.
However, we suspect this affinity difference
is not the main reason ACE2-Notch didn’t
yield a detectable signal output in the pres‐
ence of Spike, given that an scFv against
the human protein Her2 with KD of 210nM
has been recently described to enable Syn‐
Notch activation43. Perhaps more likely, the
600 amino acid-long ACE2 extracellular do‐
main is between 2 and 3 times the size of
the scFvs and nanobodies that have been
used as antigen sensors previously, sug‐

gesting potential limits on the size of antigen
sensors that SynNotch can accommodate.
However, neither of these explanations are
sufficient to explain ACE2-Notch’s deficit
given the properties of LCB1, the de novodesigned binder that was successfully incor‐
porated into SARSNotch. LCB1, and its
partner lead candidate LCB3, are both 55
amino acids long with binding affinities be‐
low 1nM, yet only LCB1 lead to strong Syn‐
Notch activation downstream of Spike bind‐
ing, whereas LCB3 produced only modest
activation even at high doses (Supplemen‐
tary Figure 6). This suggests that in addition
Weinberg et al. 2021

to size, specific binding geometry may be
required for SynNotch activation. Given
these findings, we would still recommend a
varied approach in developing future Syn‐
Notches with novel binders, exploring a
wide range of proteins as antigen sensors.
We also envision studies that use libraries of
nanobodies, different proteins truncations,
and synthetic antigen binders with different
sizes, structures, and affinities to dissect the
bio-mechanical properties of SynNotch.

infection would 1) lack any propensity to be

reservoir for the virus to replicate in, 2) de‐
tect cells that have succumbed to viral in‐
fection, and 3) detect virions before infection
has occurred. SARSNotch meets both of the
first two requirements, but falls short in the
third. We suspect that sentinel cells express‐
ing SARSNotch are not susceptible to
SARS-CoV-2 because expression of both a
viral receptor and a specific cell surface pro‐
tease are important for SARS-CoV-2 infec‐
tion44. It is also possible that LCB1 binds
Spike in an orientation that does not enable
cell entry, although ACE2-Notch also does
not confer infection susceptibility to other‐
wise unsusceptible cells (Supplementary
Figure 3D). The inability of SARSNotch to
detect virions is puzzling, especially given
the previous adaptation of SynNotch to
sensing HBV29. SynNotch, like Notch itself,
is suspected to require force applied to the
extracellular domain in order to activate, but
insufficient force generated by the virions
themselves seems unlikely given that both
SARS-CoV-2 and the lentiviral pseudotyped
virus used in this study produce virions
~100nm in diameter, twice the size of HBV
particles 45–48. We suspect that in the case of
the anti-HBV SynNotch, activation was due
to presentation of virions in trans, either as
they were bound to a hydrophobic tissue
culture plate or by cells in the process of
getting infected. If this is true, our
SARSNotch sentinel cells may be more
effective in vivo than our current data might
suggest.
Regulated production of a genetically en‐
coded therapeutic payload opens many
possibilities for combating viral threats.
Upon detection of infected cells, sentinel
cells could produce and release virus-neu‐
tralizing proteins such as monoclonal anti‐
bodies49, multivalent nanobodies22, or even
soluble versions of the de novo-designed
binders used by the cells to detect the threat
in the first place23. Such programs enable lo‐
cal delivery of otherwise systemically ap‐
plied therapies. However, the power of sen‐
tinels lies in their ability to detect multiple
signals and integrate them to produce even
more specific responses than can be
achieved through standard therapies. For
example, longitudinal studies of COVID-19
patients have demonstrated immune misfir‐
ing present in severe cases that is absent in
moderate cases50. Advanced sentinel cells
could combine sensors like SARSNotch with
synthetic sensors of endogenous immune
8 | bioRχiv

signals51–53, using cellularly-implemented
boolean logic33 to modulate immune func‐
tion in an effort to mitigate disease severity.
Although the idea of using sentinel cells
as cell-based therapeutics is enticing, sig‐
nificant work is necessary to develop them
further for this end. Even if successful, cellbased therapies are presently costly and
slow to generate. However, this may change
in the future, as ongoing work generating al‐
logeneic cell therapies shows significant
promise54. We hope that this work, along
with the prior art with HBV29 and HIV55, may
lead to successful antiviral cell-based thera‐
pies in order to combat future threats, much
as work on mRNA vaccines starting in the
1990s is proving useful to us today. In the
meantime, these systems could be adapted
for other use cases. Our specific interest is
positioning SARSNotch, with its genetic
gate, upstream of directed evolution sys‐
tems. SARSNotch could be adapted to a
system like VEGAS38, where a highly muta‐
genic virus could produce SARSNotch mu‐
tants that could be selected for higher bind‐
ing affinity to Spike or pseudotyped virions.
Alternatively, novel therapeutic compounds
could be screened in SARSNotch cell-cell
assays, where loss of fluorescent output
from sentinel cells could identify compounds
blocking SARSNotch and Spike interactions.
Beyond these ideas, we suggest that there
might be other uses of this anti-SARS-CoV2 system that we have not yet envisioned.
To this end, with this manuscript we ex‐
tend a community invitation for others to tai‐
lor this system to their own ideas, or collab‐
orate with us to push this system forward.
The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated
the value of rapid scientific communication
and collaboration. In sharing this, we hope
that our tools can contribute to such innova‐
tion. We also suggest that continuing to ex‐
tend cell-based therapies beyond cancer,
and potentially in the realm of virology, has
tremendous potential. We encourage you,
the reader, to help us push the boundaries
of what is possible as we build a new set of
tools to combat disease.

mary human CD4+ T cells were isolated from
anonymous donor blood after apheresis by
negative selection (STEMCELL Technologies
#15062 and 15023). T cells were cryopreserved in RPMI-1640 (Corning #10-040-CV)
with 20% human AB serum (Valley Biomedical, #HP1022) and 5% DMSO (SigmaAldrich #472301). After thawing, T cells were
cultured in human T cell medium consisting
of X-VIVO 15 (Lonza #04-418Q), 5% Human
AB serum and 10 mM neutralized N-acetyl LCysteine (Sigma-Aldrich #A9165) supplemented with 30 units/mL IL-2 (NCI BRB Preclinical Repository). BHK-21 cells (ATCC
CCL-10) were cultured in MEM ɑ with nucleosides and GlutaMAX (Gibco #32571-036)
supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% Anti-Anti,
and 10% Tryptose Phosphate Broth (Gibco
#18050-039). HEK293T cells expressing
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, a generous gift of
Hannah S Sperber and Dr. Satish Pillai, were
cultured in DMEM High Glucose (Gibco
#10569-010) supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% of Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 10µg/ml Blasticidin S HCl, and 2µg/ml Puromycin. All cells
were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2
Source of Primary Human T cells
Blood was obtained from Blood Centers of
the Pacific (San Francisco, CA) as approved
by the University Institutional Review Board.
Primary CD4+ T cells were isolated from
anonymous donor blood after apheresis as
described above.
Construct Preparation
The output circuit, pHR_Gal4UASpyb‐
TATA_tBFP_pGK_mCitrine, was a generous
gift from Dr. Kole Roybal. All other plasmids
were constructed using the Mammalian
Toolkit (MTK)31, a hierarchical DNA assembly
method based on Golden-Gate (GG)
cloning56. New binding domains were do‐
mesticated into the MTK by ordering primers
or gBlocks from IDT that contained the de‐
sired coding sequence with all BsaI and
BsmBI restriction sites replaced with syn‐
onymous mutations and overhangs for MTK
Part 3as, then ligated into the MTK part en‐
try vector using a BsmBI GG reaction. For
LCB1 and LCB3, protein sequences were
translated to human optimized coding se‐
quences using Benchling. The ACE2 extra‐
cellular domain (AA 1-615) was selected
based on the sufficiency of this region for
Spike binding26. The Spike ectodomain used
for presentation in sender cells was based
Weinberg et al. 2021

on a previously described structure-stabi‐
lized Spike variant37. All binding domains
were domesticated with the CD8a signal se‐
quence, a Myc tag, and a 2xG4S linker at
their N termini (MALPVTALLLPLALLL‐
HAARP-EQKLISEEDL-GGGGSGGGGS).
Transcriptional units as described in Sup‐
plementary Figures 1A and 2A were as‐
sembled into a lentiviral destination back‐
bones. All plasmids were propagated in
Stbl3 E. coli (QB3 MacroLab). Domestication
was verified via sequencing and transcrip‐
tional unit assembly was verified via restric‐
tion digest. All plasmids used in this study
are available on request, and key plasmids
will be available on Addgene.
Generation of Stable Cell Lines
Lenti-X 293T cells (Takara Bio #632180)
were seeded at approximately 7e5 cells/well
in a 6-well plate to yield ~80% confluency
the following day. The following day cells
were transfected with 1.5µg of transfer vec‐
tor containing the desired expression cas‐
sette, and the lentiviral packaging plasmids
pMD2.G (170ng) and pCMV-dR8.91 (1.33µg)
using 10µl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen
#11668-027) according to manufacturer pro‐
tocols. Media was changed after 24 hours,
and at 48 hours the viral supernatant was fil‐
tered through a 0.45µm PVDF filter and
added to Jurkat or K562 cells seeded at ap‐
proximately 1e5 cells/well in a 12-well plate.
The plates with virus were then spun at
800xg for 45 minutes at 32C. After 24 hours,
the viral media was then exchanged for
fresh media. Polyclonal cell populations
were selected via fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) as described below. The
HEK293T cell line expressing ACE2 and TM‐
PRSS2 was generated as previously de‐
scribed57.
Primary T cell Lentiviral Transduction
For each construct tested, 1e6 Primary T
cells were thawed and activated the next
day using CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Life Tech‐
nologies #11131D) at a 1:3 cell:bead ratio.
Lentivirus was generated as above, but be‐
fore cell application lentivirus was concen‐
trated using the Lenti-X Concentrator kit
(Takara Bio #631232) according to manufac‐
turer’s instructions. Concentrated virus was
applied directly to T cells (2 wells of virus
per each SynNotch construct, 1 well of virus
for output circuit). 24 hours after the addition
of the viral supernatant to T cell culture, viral

media was removed and fresh media was
added. At day 5 post T cell stimulation, Dyn‐
abeads were removed and the T cells were
sorted for construct expression via FACS.
Sorted cells were maintained at 5e5 cells/ml
until used for experiments.
Antibodies
Surface expressed proteins were assayed
for using Alexa Fluor 647 Anti-Myc tag anti‐
body (Cell Signaling Technologies #2233S).
Jurkat activation was assessed using Alexa
Fluor 647 anti-CD25 (Biologend #302618)
and BUV395 anti-CD69 (BD Biosciences
#564364). All antibodies were diluted 1:100
in DPBS (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) for
staining.
FACS
Cell lines were bulk sorted for high expres‐
sion using the UCSF Laboratory for Cell
Analysis Core Facility FACSAriaII (BD Bio‐
sciences). Cells were assessed for mCitrine
(488nm excitation, 530/30nm emission,
505lp collection dichroic), mCherry (561nm
ex, 610/20nm em, 600lp cd), and Alexa647
(633nm ex, 670/30nm em) fluorescence. Flu‐
orescence-negative controls were used to
set detector power so that negative cells ap‐
peared to have mean fluorescence ~100
counts, and then transduced cells were
sorted for cells with expression outside of
the negative control expression level. All
data were collected using FACSDiva (BD
Biosciences)
Flow Cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed using a LSR‐
Fortessa (BD Biosciences). Prior to the flow
cytometry, cells were seeded at densities
described below in a 96 well plates, using
flat-bottom plates (Falcon #353072) for ex‐
periments involving BHK-21 cells and U bot‐
tom plates for all other experiments (Falcon
#877217) and incubated for 24-72 hours as
specified by the experiment. Plates were
then spun down to settle all cells. For adher‐
ent cells, cells were incubated with 100µl
Versene (Gibco #15040-066) for 3 minutes,
then triturated and transferred to a U bottom
plate. Plates were then decanted, and rinsed
with DPBS (UCSF Cell Culture Facility). Cells
were then resuspended and stained for 45
minutes with appropriate antibodies. After
incubation, plates were spun down, rinsed
with DPBS, and resuspended in flow buffer
(DPBS with 10% FBS). The plates were then

run on the flow cytometer using a four laser
configuration (355nm, 405nm, 488nm,
561nm, 640nm), collecting fluorescence for
BUV395 (355nm ex, 379/28 em), TagBFP
(405nm ex, 450/50 em), mCitrine (488nm
em, 530/30 em, 505lp cd), mCherry (561nm
ex, 610/20 em, 600lp cd), and Alexa Fluor
647 (640nm ex, 670/14 em). At least 10,000
events were recorded for all single cell line
assays, and 30,000 events for experiments
involving two cell lines. All data were col‐
lected using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences)
Spike Protein Expression and Purification
ExpiCHO-S cells (6E6cells/mL) were trans‐
fected with 1ug/mL of Spike protein DNA22
using the ExpiCHO™ Expression System Kit
(Gibco #A29133) and shaken at 37°C and
8% CO2 in a 50mL culture. 18 hours posttransfection, cells were supplemented with
ExpiCHO™ Feed and ExpiFectamine™
CHO Enhancer and shaken at 32°C and 8%
CO2 for up to 14 days. Cells were spun at
1000xG for 10 minutes and the supernatant
was kept to collect secreted Spike protein.
Supernatant was transferred to 50 mL cen‐
trifuge tubes and supplemented with one
Pierce protease inhibitor tablet (Thermo).
The sample was then mixed with 2 mL
washed Ni-Excel resin (Cytiva), and placed
on a rocker for 1 hour for binding. After bind‐
ing, the sample was washed with 25 bed vol‐
umes of Wash buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH
8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and
eluted with 7 bed volumes of elution buffer
(10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM
imidazole) into separate 2 mL centrifuge
tubes. The elution was concentrated, filtered,
and subjected to size-exclusion chromatog‐
raphy (Superose 6 10/300 Increase, Cytiva)
using equilibration buffer (10 mM HEPES pH
8.0, 200 mM NaCl). All steps were per‐
formed at room temperature except for the
chromatography which was done at 4C. The
protein concentration was estimated based
on the protein absorbance at 280nm with a
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop One,
Thermo), flash frozen, and stored in -80 °C.
Purified Spike Activation Assay
An aliquot of purified Spike trimer protein in
sterile filtered equilibration buffer (10 mM
HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl) was thawed
on ice. Dilutions between 0.01 and 10µg/ml
were prepared in equilibration buffer and
30µl of each was added per well of a 96 well
plate. The plate was then spun down for 4

minutes at 400xg before being covered with
foil, sealed, and put in a 4C refrigerator
overnight. The following day, the proteincoated plate was then decanted and coated
wells were rinsed with DPBS. At least 16
hours after plating 1.25e4 cells were plated
in each well of the protein-bound plate prior
to spinning at 400xg for 4 minutes. Cells
were incubated with Spike for 72 hours and
then assayed for activation via flow cytome‐
try as described above.
Cell-Cell Activation Assay
Sentinel cells expressing SynNotch variants
were seeded at 1.25e4 cells/well in a 96-well
plate. At the same time, K562 cells express‐
ing indicated surface-targeted antigens were
seeded at varying ratios to the sentinels, as
indicated in Supplementary Figure 2C. At
24, 48, and 72 hours after plating, cells were
assessed for activation. Due to cell line
differences in proliferation, initial seeding
densities were not consistent for each con‐
dition at the end points. At the end points,
actual K562 density per sentinel cells was
calculated by fitting a 2 component Gauss‐
ian mixture model to the distribution of mC‐
itrine fluorescence to recover the actual
number of sentinels (high mCitrine from the
output circuit) vs. K562s (low mCitrine) per
condition. All data are plotted as this final
empirically-derived density.
Pseudotyped Virus Production and Titer
Quantification
SARS-CoV-2 spike typed pseudoviruses
were generated as previously described with
modifications58. Briefly, 293T cells were
transfected with plasmid DNA (340 ng of
Spike vector, 1μg CMV-Gag-Pol (pCMVdΔR8.91), 125 ng pAdvantage (Promega), 1
μg Luciferase reporter (per 6-well plate)) for
48 h. For positive control, Spike vector was
replaced with pMD2.G and for negative con‐
trol this vector was omitted. Supernatant
containing pseudovirus particles was col‐
lected, filtered (0.45μm), and stored in
aliquots at -80°C. Pseudotyped viruses were
quantified with a p24 assay (Takara Bio
#632200) per manufacturer's instructions.
Pseudotyped Virus Assay
The day before infection, 1.25e4 293T cells
expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or Jurkats
were seeded in a 96-well flat bottomed
plate. On the day of infection, a dilution se‐
ries of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus was
Weinberg et al. 2021

added to the plated cells. Virus with equal
titer to the highest dose used of the SARSCoV-2 pseudotyped virus, as determined by
p24 assay above, from the VSVG and vector
pseudotyped controls was added to control
wells. After incubation for 24 or 72 hours,
cells were split in half for use in activation
assay as described above, or for lumines‐
cence assay as described below.
Luminescence Assay
Cells for were transferred to opaque-bot‐
tomed white plates (Grenier-Bio #655073)
and then assessed for luminescence
(Promega #E1501) per manufacturer’s proto‐
col. Briefly, cells were lysed for 5 minutes
and then incubated with luciferase sub‐
strate. Luciferase output was measured us‐
ing a TECAN Infinite m1000 PRO with an in‐
tegration time of 1s and either no attenua‐
tion (24 hours) or OD2 attenuation (72
hours).
Data Presentation, Analysis, and Availability
All experiments were performed in at least
biological triplicate. All data points are the
mean of 3 replicates, with error presented as
either standard deviation or ±95% confi‐
dence intervals where indicated. For flow cy‐
tometry experiments, means were calcu‐
lated for all cells within a single replicate,
and the presented means and error are cal‐
culated between replicates. Events collected
from flow cytometry were filtered to remove
small events and then density gated on FSC
and SSC to capture singlet populations.
Where presented, density estimates repre‐
sent all events for all 3 replicates in a flow
cytometry experiment, and are calculated
via seaborn’s kdeplot function with band‐
width adjustment of 0.2. To calculate activa‐
tion, conditions were first assessed for bi‐
modality via exploratory data analysis. For
experiments where no bimodality was ob‐
served, activation is expressed as mean flu‐
orescence intensity of BFP. For experiments
where bimodality was apparent, a 2 compo‐
nent Gaussian mixture model was fit to data
pooled from all conditions to identify the
means of the on and off components. Then
percent activation was calculated by scoring
the component memberships of all cells in a
given condition. A similar process was used
to calculate cell densities, using mCitrine flu‐
orescence. All data analysis was conducted
using custom Python scripts, available on
github (https://github.com/weinberz/
