Abstract
The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of

18

confirmed cases and thousands of deaths globally. Extensive efforts and progress have been

19

made to develop effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. A primary target of these

20

vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, and many studies utilized structural vaccinology

21

techniques to either stabilize the protein or fix the receptor-binding domain at certain states. In

22

this study, we extended an evolutionary protein design algorithm, EvoDesign, to create

23

thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation and B cell

24

epitopes of the S protein. We then evaluated the mutated S protein candidates based on predicted

25

MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes as well as the epitopes’ similarity to human peptides. The

26

presented strategy aims to improve the S protein’s immunogenicity and antigenicity by inducing

27

stronger CD4 T cell response while maintaining the protein’s native structure and function. The

28

top EvoDesign S protein candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II T cell

29

promiscuous epitopes in the native S protein, in which two epitopes were present in all seven

30

human coronaviruses. This newly designed S protein also introduced nine new MHC-II T cell

31

promiscuous epitopes and showed high structural similarity to its native conformation. The

32

proposed structural vaccinology method provides an avenue to rationally design the antigen’s

33

structure with increased immunogenicity, which could be applied to the rational design of new

34

COVID-19 vaccine candidates.

Introduction

36

The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute

37

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 18 million confirmed

38

cases and 702,642 deaths globally as of August 6 2020 according to the World Health

39

Organization [1]. Tremendous efforts have been made to develop effective and safe vaccines

40

against this viral infection. The Moderna mRNA-1273 induced vaccine-induced anti-SARS-

41

CoV-2 immune responses in all 45 participants of phase I clinical trial [2], and advanced to

42

phase III clinical trial in record time. On the other hand, the Inovio INO-4800 DNA vaccine not

43

only showed protection from the viral infection in rhesus macaques, but was also reported to

44

induce long-lasting memory [3]. In addition to these two vaccines, there are over a hundred

45

COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials including other types of vaccines such as the

46

Oxford-AstraZeneca adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) [4], CanSino’s

47

adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored COVID-19 vaccine [5], and Sinovac’s absorbed COVID-19

48

(inactivated) vaccine (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04456595). Among all the vaccines, a

49

vast majority of them select the spike glycoprotein (S) as their primary target.

50

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a promising vaccine target and many clinical studies

51

reported anti-S protein neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 recovered patients [6]. After the

52

SARS outbreak in 2003 [7], clinical studies reported neutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-

53

CoV S protein [8,9], which was selected as the target of vaccine development [10,11]. Since

54

SARS-CoV-2 shares high sequence identity with SARS-CoV [12], it is presumed that

55

neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein could be an important correlate of protection in

56

COVID-19 vaccine development [13]. Many computational studies utilizing reverse vaccinology

57

and immuno-informatics reported the S protein to be a promising vaccine antigen [14–16], and

58

clinical studies identified anti-S protein neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 recovered patients

59

[17–19]. The cryo-EM structure of the S protein [20] and the neutralizing antibodies binding to

60

the S protein [21,22] were determined. Besides neutralizing antibodies, studies have also shown

61

the importance of CD4 T cell response in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possible pre-

62

existing immunity in healthy individuals without exposure to SARS-CoV-2 [6,23,24]. Overall,

63

successful vaccination is likely linked to a robust and long-term humoral response to the SARS-

64

CoV-2 S protein, which could be further enhanced by the rational structural design of the

65

protein.

66

Structural vaccinology has shown successes to improve vaccine candidates’

67

immunogenicity through protein structural modification. The first proof-of-concept was achieved

68

by fixing the conformation-dependent neutralization-sensitive epitopes on the fusion

69

glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus [25]. A similar strategy has been applied to SARS-

70

CoV-2 to conformationally control the S protein’s receptor-binding domain (RBD) domain

71

between the “up” and “down” configurations to induce immunogenicity [26]. In this study, we

72

extended structural vaccinology to rationally design the SARS-CoV-2 S protein by generating

73

thousands of stable S protein variants without perturbing the surface conformation of the protein

74

to maintain the same B cell epitope profile. In the meantime, mutations were introduced to the

75

residues buried inside the S protein so that more MHC-II T cell epitopes would be added into the

76

newly designed S protein to potentially induce a stronger immune response. Finally, we

77

evaluated the computationally designed protein candidates and compared them to the native S

78

protein.

Materials and methods

81

Computational redesign of SARS-CoV-2 S protein

82

Fig 1 illustrates the workflow for redesigning the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to improve its

83

immunogenic potential toward vaccine design. The full-length structure model (1,273 amino acids

84

for an S monomer) of SARS-CoV-2 S assembled by C-I-TASSER [27] was used as the template

85

for fixed-backbone protein sequence design using EvoDesign [28]. Although the cryo-EM

86

structure for SARS-CoV-2 S is available (PDB ID: 6VSB) [20], it contains a large number of

87

missing residues, and therefore, the full-length C-I-TASSER model was used for S protein design

88

instead. The C-I-TASSER model of the S protein showed a high similarity to the cryo-EM structure

89

with a TM-score [29] of 0.87 and RMSD of 3.4 Å in the common aligned regions, indicating a

90

good model quality. The residues in the S protein were categorized into three groups: core, surface,

91

and intermediate [30], according to their solvent accessible surface area ratio (SASAr).

92

Specifically, SASAr is defined as the ratio of the absolute SASA of a residue in the structure to

93

the maximum area of the residue in the GXG state [31], where X is the residue of interest; the

94

SASAr ratios were calculated using the ASA web-server (http://cib.cf.ocha.ac.jp/bitool/ASA/).

95

The core and surface residues were defined as those with SASAr <5% and >25%, respectively,

96

while the other residues were regarded as intermediate. Since the surface residues may be involved

97

in the interactions with other proteins (e.g., the formation of the S homotrimer, S-ACE2 complex,

98

and S-antibody interaction) and may partially constitute the B cell epitopes, these residues were

99

excluded from design, and more rigorously, their side-chain conformations were kept constant as

100

well. Besides, the residues that may form B cell epitopes reported by Grifoni et al. [15] were also

101

fixed. The remaining core residues were subjected to design, allowing amino acid substitution,

102

whereas the intermediate residues were repacked with conformation substitution. Specifically, 243,

103

275, and 755 residues were designed, repacked, and fixed, respectively; a list of these residue

104

positions is shown in Supplementary Table S1.

105
106

During protein design, the evolution term in EvoDesign was turned off as this term would

107

introduce evolutionary constraints on the sequence simulation search which were not needed for

108

this design [32]; therefore, only the physical energy function, EvoEF2 [30], was used for design

109

scoring to broaden sequence diversity and help to identify more candidates with increased

110

immunogenicity. We performed 20 independent design simulations and collected all the simulated

111

sequence decoys. A total of 5,963,235 sequences were obtained, and the best-scoring sequence

112

had stability energy of -4100.97 EvoEF2 energy unit (EEU). A set of 22,914 non-redundant

113

sequences that were within a 100 EEU window of the lowest energy and had >5% of the design

114

residues mutated were retained for further analysis (Fig. 1).

115
116

MHC-II T cell epitope prediction and epitope content score calculation

117

The full-length S protein sequence was divided into 15-mers with 10 amino-acid overlaps. For

118

each 15-mer, the T cell MHC-II promiscuous epitopes were predicted using NetMHCIIpan v3.2

119

[33], and an epitope was counted if the median percentile rank was ≤ 20.0% by binding the 15-

120

mer to any of the seven MHC-II alleles [34] (i.e., HLA-DRB1*03:01, HLA-DRB1*07:01, HLA-

121

DRB1*15:01,

122

DRB5*01:01). The selection of these seven MHC-II alleles aimed to predict the dominant MHC-

123

II T cell epitopes across different ethnicity and HLA polymorphism. The MHC-II promiscuous

124

epitopes of the native SARS-CoV-2 S protein (QHD43416) predicted using this method were also

125

validated and compared to the dominant T cell epitopes mapped by Grifoni et al. [15]. In brief,

126

Grifoni et al. mapped the experimentally verified SARS-CoV T cell epitopes reported in the IEDB

127

database to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein based on sequence homology and reported as the dominant

128

T cell epitopes. The epitope content score (ECS) for a full-length S protein was defined as the

129

average value of the median percentile ranks for all the 15-mers spanning the whole sequence.

130
131

Human epitope similarity and human similarity score calculation

132

The human proteome included 20,353 reviewed (Swiss-Prot) human proteins downloaded from

133

Uniprot (as of July 1, 2020) [35]. A total of 261,908 human MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes

134

were predicted, as described above. The human epitope similarity between a peptide of interest

135

(e.g., a peptide of the S protein) and a human epitope was then calculated using a normalized

136

peptide similarity metric proposed by Frankild et al. [36]. In brief, the un-normalized peptide

137

similarity score, 𝐴(𝑥, 𝑦), was first determined by the BLOSUM35 matrix [37] for all the positions

138

between a target peptide (y) and a human epitope (x), which was subsequently normalized using

139

the minimum and maximum similarity scores for the human epitope (Eq. 1). Finally, the maximum

140

normalized similarity score of a 15-mer peptide was calculated by comparing to all the predicted

141

human MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes. The human similarity score (HSS) of the full-length

142

S protein was calculated by averaging the human epitope similarity of all the 15-mers.

Pre-existing immunity evaluation of the designed proteins

147

The pre-existing immunity of the designed proteins was evaluated and compared to that of the

148

native S protein of seven human CoVs (i.e., SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E,

149

HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1). The sequences of the seven HCoV S proteins

150

were downloaded from Uniprot [35] (Table S2), and the MHC-II T cell epitopes were predicted as

151

described above. The conserved epitopes were determined by the IEDB epitope clustering tool [38]

152

and aligned using SEAVIEW [39].

153
154

Foldability assessment of the designed proteins

155

Since EvoDesign only produces a panel of mutated sequences, it is important to examine if the

156

designed sequences can fold into the desired structure that the native S protein adopts. To examine

157

their foldability, we used C-I-TASSER to model the structure of the designed sequences, where

158

the structural similarity between the native and designed S proteins was assessed by TM-score

159

[40]. Here, C-I-TASSER is a recently developed protein structure prediction program, which

160

constructs full-length structure folds by assembling fragments threaded from the PDB, under the

161

guidance of deep neural-network learning-based contact maps [41,42]. The ectodomain of the S

162

homotrimers was visualized via PyMOL [43].

164

Results

165

The epitope content score (ECS) and human similarity score (HSS) of the S proteins from

166

seven HCoV strains (severe HCoV: SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV; mild HCoV:

167

HCoV-229, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) were computed. The ECS for the

168

severe HCoV S proteins was significantly different from that for the mild ones (p = 0.0016, Mann-

169

Whitney). In terms of HSS, the severe HCoV S proteins tended to be less self-like compared to

170

the mild ones (p = 0.097, Mann-Whitney). Overall, it was shown that both ECS and HSS might be

171

used as indicators of the immunogenic potential of the designed S proteins.

172

On the other hand, previous studies suggested the potential role of pre-existing immunity

173

in fighting COVID-19 [6,23,24]. Therefore, the predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes of

174

the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were compared to those from the other six HCoVs. There were two

175

SARS-CoV-2 predicted MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes, which were also present on all of

176

the seven HCoV S proteins (Fig 2), which could be potentially linked to pre-existing immunity.

177

Therefore, the designs were subsequently filtered based on the availability of these pre-existing

178

immunity-related epitopes (Fig 1). In particular, the SARS-CoV-2 promiscuous epitope S816-

179

D830 overlapped with the dominant B cell epitope F802-E819 reported by Grifoni et al. [15].

180

Among the 22,914 designs with relatively low stability energy, 19,063 candidates that

181

contained the two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes were ranked based on ECS and HSS (Fig

182

3A). Using the ECS and HSS of the native SARS-CoV-2 S as the cutoff, we obtained 301

183

candidates with a better immunogenic potential (i.e., lower ECS and HSS) (Fig 3B). Ten

184

candidates with balanced ECS and HSS were selected and evaluated (Table 1, full-length

185

sequences in Table S3).

186
187

Design-10705 was overall the best candidate with high structural similarity to the native S

protein and good immunogenic potential (in terms of promiscuous epitope count, ECS and HSS

189

scores) amongst the top ten candidates. The candidate Design-10705 had a 93.9% sequence

190

identity to the native S protein with TM-score (0.931) and RMSD (3.45 Å) to the C-I-TASSER

191

model of the native S protein. The homo-trimer 3D structure of Design-10705 was visualized and

192

compared to the S protein C-I-TASSER and cryo-EM structural models (Fig 4). In terms of

193

immunogenicity, it had the second-highest number of promiscuous epitopes. Table 2 showed the

194

complete MHC-II T cell epitope profile of Design-10705. There were 32 predicted promiscuous

195

epitopes in the native S protein (Table S4), and 31 of them were recovered in Design-10705. The

196

two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes, V991-Q1005 and S816-D830, were both recovered in

197

the new design. Besides these two epitopes, there were 19 epitopes identical to the native S protein

198

epitopes, while 10 epitopes had at least one mutation in Design-10705. Compared with the native

199

S protein, the only missing MHC-II epitope in design 10705 was V911-N926, which was predicted

200

to have reduced binding affinity to HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB4*01:01. Critically, this

201

design introduced nine new MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes, which could potentially induce

202

a stronger immune response with minimal perturbation compared with the native S protein.

203

Discussion

204

The subunit, DNA, and mRNA vaccines are typically considered to be safer but often

205

induce weaker immune responses than the live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines. Although the

206

addition of adjuvant or better vaccination strategies can compensate for the immunogenicity, the

207

addition of new epitopes to the antigen provides an alternative way to induce stronger immune

208

responses [44,45]. During the protein design process, we applied design constraints so that the

209

surface conformation, and in particular, B cell epitopes of the designed S protein variants were

210

unchanged. For the designed S proteins with at least 5% of the core residues mutated, the

211

immunogenicity potential of these candidates was evaluated and was structurally compared to

212

the native S protein. The top candidate (Design-10705) recovered 31 out of 32 MHC-II

213

promiscuous epitopes, and, the two pre-existing immunity-related epitopes (V991-Q1005 and

214

S816-D830) were present in the design. In addition to the 31 recovered epitopes, Design-10705

215

also introduced nine new MHC-II promiscuous epitopes with the potential to induce stronger

216

CD4 T cell response.

217

The concept of manipulating epitopes to decrease the immunogenicity has been applied

218

to therapeutic proteins. King at el. disrupted the MHC-II T cell epitopes in GFP and

219

Pseudomonas exotoxin A using the Rosetta protein design protocol [46,47]. The EpiSweep

220

program was also applied to structurally redesign bacteriolytic enzyme lysostaphin as an anti-

221

staphylococcal agent with reduced immunogenicity to the host [48,49]. In this study, a similar

222

strategy, but to improve immunogenicity, was applied to redesign the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as

223

an enhanced vaccine candidate; specifically, we aimed to increase immunogenicity by

224

introducing more MHC-II T cell promiscuous epitopes to the protein without reducing the

225

number of B cell epitopes.

226

The addition of epitopes to induce stronger immune responses has been previously

227

applied to develop H7N9 vaccines. The H7N9 hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine elicits non-

228

neutralizing antibody responses in clinical trials [50,51]. Rudenko et al. reported that there were

229

fewer CD4 T cell epitopes found in H7N9 HA in comparison to the seasonal H1 and H3 HA

230

proteins [52]. Based on this finding, Wada et al. improved the H7N9 vaccine by introducing a

231

known H3 immunogenic epitope to the H7 HA protein without perturbing its conformation,

232

which resulted in an over 4-fold increase of HA-binding antibody response [44]. However, the

233

number of epitopes is not the only factor that influences the protective immunity. Studies have

234

reported that CD8 T cell epitopes might induce regulatory T cell responses [36,53], and

235

pathogens adapted to include CD4 and CD8 epitopes with high similarity to human peptides as a

236

means to suppress host immunity for its survival [54]. Therefore, we examined the significance

237

of ECS and HSS in the context of mild versus severe forms of HCoV infection and then utilized

238

these two scores to evaluate the designed S protein candidates.

239

The computational design of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein could be coupled with some

240

other structural modifications for a more rational structure-based vaccine design. The present

241

study aims to introduce new epitopes to the S protein while keeping the surface residues

242

unchanged to minimize the structural change of the designed proteins, and according to protein

243

structure prediction, the designed candidates were structurally similar to the native S protein

244

(Table 1 & Fig 4). The structural modifications performed on the native S protein, such as

245

stabilizing the protein in its prefusion form [55], or fixing the RBD in the “up” or “down” state,

246

could still be applied to the final candidate in this study. The combination of these structural

247

vaccinology technologies into the current pipeline could further enhance the immunogenicity of

248

the S protein as a vaccine target. However, a major limitation of the present study is the wet-lab

249

experimental validation of the designed proteins. First, the newly designed protein sequences

250

need to be folded properly with a structure comparable to that of the native S protein. Second,

251

the capability of the newly added epitopes for binding MHC-II molecules and subsequently

252

inducing immune responses need to be validated. Finally, these candidates should be tested for

253

their protectiveness and safety in animal models.

254

Overall, this study presents a strategy to improve the immunogenicity and antigenicity of

255

a vaccine candidate by manipulating the MHC-II T cell epitopes through computational protein

256

design. In the current settings, the immunogenicity evaluation was carried out after the standard

257

protein design simulations with EvoDesign. In the future, the assessment of the immunogenic

258

potential could be incorporated into the protein design process so that the sequence decoy

259

generated at each step will be guided by balancing both the protein stability and immunogenicity.

260

Moreover, with proper prior knowledge of known epitopes (e.g., both MHC-I and MHC-II from

261

the pathogen proteome), it is also possible to create a chimeric protein, which integrates epitopes

262

from antigens other than the target protein.

Fig 1. The workflow of designing and screening immunogenicity-enhanced SARS-CoV-2 S

440

proteins. The procedure started from defining the full-length SARS-CoV-2 native S protein into

441

surface, intermediate, and core residues. This information was then fed into EvoDesign to generate

442

structurally stable designs that introduce mutations to the core residues while keeping the surface

443

conformation unchanged. The output design candidates from EvoDesign were then evaluated

444

based on their immunogenic potential. The top ten candidates were also compared and evaluated

445

in comparison to the native S protein.
