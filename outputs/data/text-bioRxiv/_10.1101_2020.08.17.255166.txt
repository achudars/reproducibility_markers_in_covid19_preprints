Abstract
An explanation is required for the re-emergence of COVID-19 outbreaks in regions with apparent
local eradication. Recent outbreaks have emerged in Vietnam, New Zealand and parts of China
where there had been no cases for some months. Importation of contaminated food and food
packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.
Such events can be prevented if the risk is better appreciated.
Main text
An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing has been accredited by
Chinese authorities to imported contaminated food (1). It occurred 55 days after the last identified
locally acquired case in Beijing. Steps to mitigate the risk of similar outbreaks have been taken within
China, yet elsewhere this risk is underappreciated. Vietnam and New Zealand have new unexplained
outbreaks 99 and 102 days, respectively, since their last identified local transmissions (2,3).
It is possible in these regions that eradication was never truly achieved and that there had been
ongoing unidentified transmission. Alternatively, occult transmission chains can be seeded through
travelers but this mechanism would require a false negative swab in an asymptomatic individual or
failure to ensure quarantine. For occult transmission to lead to recrudescence of an outbreak
months since the last detected case would require an ascertainment rate that for most settings is
implausibly small, as demonstrated through simulations (supplementary material). Even for a
reproduction number of 1, a transmission chain that avoided stochastic extinction, and only one in
twenty infections being detected, the chance of reaching 20 generations without detection is at
most one in a thousand.
Another possibility to explain reemergence is transport of contaminated products such as foodstuffs.
A well recognised feature of the COVID-19 pandemic is the number of clusters within meat and
seafood processing facilities. In the UK, outbreaks of COVID-19 caused disruption in a poultry
processing plant and in an establishment producing ready meals for supermarkets (4). Fish
processing in tuna canneries in Portugal and Ghana was suspended after workers in both countries
tested positive for COVID-19 (5,6). Abattoirs in Australia have closed following large clusters
amongst its workers (7,8). In Germany, more than 1,500 workers tested positive for COVID-19 at one
of the largest slaughterhouses in Gütersloh culminating in a lockdown of two districts and over
600,000 people (9).
The Beijing Xinfadi wholesale food market event has lead to concerns that imported contaminated
food could seed new clusters. SARS-CoV-2 was detected on workers and environmental samples,
including a cutting board used to slice imported salmon. A swabbing campaign directed at millions of
nearby residents as well as all workers at the market and the broader Beijing food chain revealed
335 COVID-19 cases (10).
Chinese authorities acted quickly to suspend import of salmon from Europe (11,12), and later
imports from food premises where outbreaks of COVID-19 have occurred among workers, affecting
the US, Germany and Brazil among others (13). In July, China also suspended imports of shrimp from
three Ecuadorean processing plants after detecting SARS-CoV-2 on shipments (14).
The feasibility of this “non traditional” transmission mechanism is currently debated. At 21–23°C no
viable SARS-CoV-2 was found after 4 hours on copper surfaces, 24 hours on cardboard and after 3
days on stainless steel and plastic surfaces (15). We have assessed the survival of SARS-CoV-2 on

refrigerated and frozen meat and salmon over 3 weeks to assess the potential of outbreaks being
seeded by imported contaminated food.
Vero-E6 cells (ATCC# CRL-1586) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. SARS-CoV-2, isolate
BetaCoV/Singapore/2/2020 (Accession ID EPI_ISL_406973), was used as virus inoculum. All work
with SARS-CoV-2 was performed under BSL3 containment at the Duke-NUS Medical School ABSL3
laboratory.
Individual pieces of salmon, chicken and pork sourced from supermarkets in Singapore were sliced
into 500 mm3 cubes and 200 µl of 3 x 106 TCID50/ml SARS-CoV-2 was added to each cube. The
samples were stored at 3 different temperatures (4˚C, –20˚C and –80˚C) and harvested at specified
time points (1, 2, 5, 7, 14- and 21-days post-inoculation). Following incubation, 150 µl of the virus
inoculum was transferred to a new tube and frozen at –80°C until titration. Three replicates were
performed for each condition. The cell-free virus titre (TCID50/mL) for each sample were determined
by limited dilution. The limit of detection (LOD) was 5 x 101 TCID50/mL. GraphPad Prism (Version
5.04) was used to perform one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test.
The titre of SARS-CoV-2 remained constant at 4°C, –20°C and –80°C for the duration of the
experiment (Fig 1). Infectivity was maintained for 3 weeks in both the refrigerated (4°C) and frozen
(–20°C and –80°C) samples. No significant difference was observed between SARS-CoV-2 recovered
after incubation with or without the presence of food.
The WHO advises that it is very unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food
packaging (16). While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a
major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no COVID19 and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis. It is necessary to understand the risk of an
item becoming contaminated and remaining so at the time of export, and of the virus surviving the
transport and storage conditions.
The clusters of infection of COVID-19 among workers in slaughterhouses and meat processing
facilities in many countries can be attributed to factors that promote transmission of virus directly
between workers, such as crowding, poor ventilation, and shouting in close proximity due to high
ambient noise levels. Workers may go to work when infected, they may live in crowded housing, and
travel on crowded transport. Environmental contamination at the work site is likely to be prolonged
due to low temperatures, metal surfaces and lack of UV light (17,18).
With a significant burden of virus present in infected workers and the environment then
contamination of meat with SARS-CoV-2 is possible during butchering and processing. The killing
lines in abattoirs generally run at ambient temperature but the process later moves into a controlled
environmental temperature of not greater than 12°C for the breakdown of carcasses and meat is
maintained at 3–7°C as legislated by food regulations. The processing of meat and poultry is
generally carried out manually in crowded conditions. Salmon processing is, in contrast, highly
automated with filleting and cutting performed by machines, and minimal handling by workers.
However, where such processing is carried out manually in crowded conditions the risk of
contamination increases.
Our laboratory work has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can survive the time and temperatures associated
with transportation and storage conditions associated with international food trade. When adding
SARS-CoV-2 to chicken, salmon and pork pieces there was no decline in infectious virus after 21 days
at 4°C (standard refrigeration) and –20°C (standard freezing).

Contamination of food is possible, and virus survival during transport and storage is likely. Food
transportation and storage occurs in a controlled setting akin to a laboratory. Temperature and
relative humidity is consistent and maintained and adverse conditions such as drying out is not
permitted for the integrity of the food. In quantifying the viral titre we can reasonably assess a rate
of decline in infectivity, which did not occur in any of the conditions we assessed.
We believe it is possible that contaminated imported food can transfer virus to workers as well as
the environment. An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new
outbreak. The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected
to occur from time to time.
Efforts to avert the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks seeded by contaminated food must begin at the
source; that is food processing premises. These include frequent hand washing, cleaning of food
contact surfaces, materials and utensils. Fitness to work protocols should be in place and unwell
staff should be excluded. Furthermore, the conditions under which workers in our food chain must
be reviewed to ensure that our food is safe. Financial support needs to be given to unwell workers to
ensure no disincentives to self-isolation or presenting for a test. PPE usage needs to be overseen and
social distancing in and out of the workplace needs to be supported.
In receiving markets at the other end of the supply chain, food cannot be decontaminated, however,
added precautions to ensure good hand hygiene and regular cleaning of surfaces and utensils is
important. Consumers should wash their hands after touching uncooked products and ensure that
food is well cooked.
Our findings, coupled with the reports from China of SARS-CoV-2 being detected on imported frozen
chicken and frozen shrimp packaging material, should alert food safety competent authorities and
the food industry of a “new normal” environment where this virus is posing a non-traditional food
safety risk.

Appendix to Fisher et al
To assess the feasibility of long chains of occult infection leading to clusters some time after a community was
thought to have been clear of infection, we built a branching process simulation model. Each case is assumed
to generate a Poisson-distributed number of secondary cases with mean 𝜌. We seed the chain with a single
unidentified case in generation 0, the untraced and unobserved daughter infection of a case. The number of
infections in generation 𝑔 of the chain is denoted 𝑁𝑔 , which has distribution 𝑃𝑜(𝑁𝑔 𝜌). Each case after the
initial infection that seeds the chain is ascertained with probability 𝛼. The chain is simulated forward for 30
generations or until 1 000 000 cases or until the first case is ascertained. We then calculate the number of
generations passed until the chain is uncovered or becomes extinct, and the probability there is on-going
occult transmission in each generation. The probability the chain of infection is detected and the expected
number of infections are derived through Monte Carlo simulation with 100 000 draws.

Figure S1: Probability of ongoing undetected transmission for the first 20 generations for four values of the
ascertainment rate (𝛼 = 5%, 10%, 25% and 50%) and reproduction number (𝜌 = 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5). Probabilities
<1/100 000 are set to 1/100 000 for graphical purposes.

It is very unlikely that ongoing occult transmission would be maintained for more than ten generations except
for low reproduction numbers and very low ascertainment rates.
