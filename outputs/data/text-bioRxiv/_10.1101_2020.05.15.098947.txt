Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a recently-emerged zoonotic pathogen already well adapted to transmission and
replication in humans. Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have
the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary
structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed
subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce
changes in Watson-Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets
matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2 permissive host cells, we identified twelve separate target
sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; eight of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A
genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease,
is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the
human host could be constrained by host miRNA defence. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary
structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2
evolution, and a potential platform for engineered viral attenuation and antigen presentation.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, RNA secondary structure, Conserved mutation and miRNA.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has rapidly emerged as a zoonotic pathogen with broad cellular tropism in human, or
zoonotic-host cells. Host selection pressure on SARS-CoV-2 virus would be expected to have a major impact on
the conservation of mutations that enhance viral fitness. Of these selection pressures, the cellular-based adaptive
and innate immune systems will be major constraints to viral evolution. Intracellular detection and anti-viral
pathways within infected cells are a critical frontline to control virus replication. The success of the SARS
coronaviruses is proposed to be due to their ability to suppress intracellular anti-viral pathways. For example,
interference with dsRNA detection and the interferon response is enabled through the activity of several nonstructural proteins (Nsp). In addition, the sequestration of genomic viral RNA into double membrane vesicles, and
dsRNA cleavage by Nsp15, is inferred from the closely related SARS-CoV-1 virus, and likely acts to prevent
intracellular detection of the virus [1]. In addition to encoded mechanisms of immune avoidance, the paucity of

CpG runs in SARS-CoV-2 genome with unexpectedly low GC-content at codon position-three points to major
selection pressure being placed on structural features of the genome [2].
As a recently emerged zoonotic pathogen, it might be expected that bat-adaptations will not be optimal for
infection and replication in human cells. However, extensive mutation and strain-radiation has not yet been
observed [3]. The low mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2 is reduced by the activity of the 3' - 5' exonuclease Nsp14
in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex. An alternative possibility is that the observed mutation
rate is lower than the actual mutation rate, but that deleterious mutations have already been lost through natural
selection. The short time frame of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, coupled to a low mutation rate is consistent with a
founder effect for geographical bias in mutation patterns [3].
A common primary focus of mutational analysis of emerging viruses is the alteration in amino acid sequence of
viral proteins that may provide enhanced or new functions for virus replication, immune avoidance, or spread.
However, nucleic acid secondary structure and sub-translational events have a critical impact on genome
replication [4], virus maturation and genome packaging [5]. In addition, the RNA secondary structures of SARSCoV-2 genes have been proposed to be druggable targets [6-8]. Because little is known of the influence of SARSCoV-2 mutations on the RNA secondary structure, and its possible implications for inhibition by host miRNA,
we have modeled the impact of common mutations of the structure and susceptibility of the SARS-CoV-2 genome
to interference from host miRNA.
The incident presence of host miRNA targets within the SARS-CoV-2 genome may be pivotal for the action of
host selection pressures to further shape further viral evolution. Viruses not only alter host miRNA expression,
but may also produce miRNAs to promote their infectivity [9-12]. On the other hand, the host targets viral
transcripts for inhibition of translation, or mRNA destruction, through an miRNA-mediated defence system. Since
miRNA are extremely divergent between species, it would be expected that bat-adapted SARS-CoV-2 will
undergo selection pressure derived from human miRNA interference [9-11,13,14]. While perfect matches of
miRNA to target viral sequences results in miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC)-mediate destruction of
viral RNA, imperfect matches interfere with translation [15].
A growing body of evidence suggests that human miRNAs act as a critical host defense against coronaviruses.
An interaction between human coronavirus OC43 nucleocapsid and miR-9 can enhance the type I interferon
response necessary to clear viral infection [16]. Several host miRNAs (miR-574-5p, -14, -17, -9, -223 and -148a)
bind to SARS-CoV encoded transcripts such as S, E, M, N and ORF1a [17,18]. On the other hand, SARS-CoV
escapes from miRNA-mediated defence through the manipulation of host miRNA machinery [17,18].
Additionally, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 express short RNAs that resemble miRNAs and could impact upon
host house-keeping or immune defence processes [19-21]. More recently, several studies have proposed that host
miRNAs bind SARS-CoV-2 transcripts [19,21,22]. However, host miRNAs inhibition of viral replication is
relevant only if the identified miRNAs are expressed in target host cells.
Both DNA viruses, and 'cytoplasmically-confined' RNA viruses, use the host RNA splicing-machinery to generate
new viral transcripts, or to modify the host transcriptome in favor of their own replication [23-27]. It has been
suggested that the fused leader sequence in 5′ end of the mouse hepatitis virus (betacoronavirus) mRNAs is result
of a non-canonical splicing process [28]. Moreover, deep RNA sequencing has identified several unknown SARS-

CoV-2 viral RNAs, possibly the result of non-canonical splicing events [29]. Therefore, our study has additionally
identified and mapped mutations to predicted mRNA splice sites within the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
No selective advantage of the identified sequence alterations in SARS-CoV-2 should be inferred by their inclusion
here. However, the potential of these mutations to impact upon RNA structure and miRNA recognition provides
a basis for ongoing monitoring of viral evolution at these sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
The interplay of viral genome sequences and host miRNA might be veiwed as academic and refractory for
translation into usable clinical outcomes. However, the inclusion of host miRNA binding sites into the ORF of
conserved viral regions essential for the viral life cycle is a feasible mechanism for enhancing the attenuation of
live vaccines [30-32], or antigen availability of epiptopes for the adaptive immune response [33-36].

Methods
SARS-CoV-2 virus reference sequence was downloaded from NCBI (NC_045512.2) along with 55 sequences up
to May 1st, 2020 from NCBI or GASID databases. We tried to include wide range of countries with available
sequences up to May 1st. In case of USA, 15 sequences from different states was included. Clustal Omega and
Geneious alignment tools were used to perform multiple sequence alignment. Mutations with occurrence in
multiple sequences originated from different countries were categorized as conserved mutation.
Potential splice donor / acceptor splice sites, exon splicing enhancer (ESE), exon splicing silencer (ESS), intron
splicing enhancer (ISE) and intron splicing silencer (ISS) motifs were predicted using RegRNA2 [37], HSF [38]
and NIPU [39,40] tools.
We used well-accepted methods to predict the RNA secondary structure in both wild type and mutated sequences.
Minimum free energy (MFE) structures [41] and centroid structures [42] were calculated by RNAfold program to
predict RNA secondary structures. To evaluate the impact of mutations on RNA secondary setructure and basepair probability, we utilized RNAfold, RNAalifold [43], MutaRNA [40,44] and RNAsnp [45] programs.
For identifying potential miRNA binding sites, the SARS-COV-2 genome was screened with RegRNA2 and
miRDB [46]. We excluded miRNAs that are not expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells such as lung, esophagus,
kidney and small intestine [47,48]. The expression level of miRNAs in target cells were determined by TissueAtlas
[49], IMOTA [50], or using published data. The impact of mutations on miRNAs binding were visualized by
RegRNA2, miRDB, IntaRNA [51] and CopomuS [40]. We used IntaRNA to illustrate miRNA binding to its
target.

Results
Identification of SARS-Cov-2 conserved mutations
A total of 55 SARS-CoV-2 patient isolate sequences were collected from NCBI and GISAID databases were
aligned against SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (NC_045512.2). The mutations present in multiple sequences
and in at least in three different countries were categorized as 'conserved mutations' [52]. In the line with previous

reports, we confirmed the occurrence of conserved mutations at positions 1397 (Nsp2), 3037 (Nsp3), 8782 (Nsp4),
11083 (Nsp6), 14408 (Nsp12), 23403 (S), 26143 (ORF3a) and 28144/ 28881 (N) [52-56]. We also considered
nine additional conserved mutations with occurrence in multiple countries (Table 1 & S1). Most of these mutations
are substitutions of C/G to U. The high A/U content (U= 32.1%/ A= 29.9%/ G= 19.6%/ C=18.4%) and enrichment
of codons in in pyrimidines is likely due to APOBEC editing of viral RNA and the fact that Nsp14 (proof-reading)
does not remove U (the product of cytosine deamination) [57]. Two mutations at 241 and 29742, are in the 5' and
3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Seven mutations are silent point mutations, including 313, 14805, 17247 and
28686, while the others result in amino acid changes (Table 1). None of these amino acid changes are conservative
substitutions. Interestingly, the C27964U (S24L in ORF8) exists only in 97 USA sequences, with the earliest
isolated in March 9th (MT325581.1), after USA underwent lockdown [58] (Figure S1).

RNA secondary structure
Among all the mutations, only two mutations were predicted to have an impact on secondary structure of viral
RNA. First, a conserved mutation 1059 in Nsp2 changed the secondary structure of Nsp2 dramatically (Figure
1A). This mutation also increased the Watson-Crick base-pair probability – predicted to result in more stable RNA
secondary structure (Figure 1B, C, D & E). This mutation had no effect on RNA accessibility which is a
consideration for RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions (Figure 1F).

is significant). (D) The dot plot provides the absolute differences of the base pairing probabilities of mutated vs. wildtype
RNA. The upper right part of (top-left) visualizes weakening of the base pairing potential, while the lower left reports base
pairs with increased probability within the mutant. Again, darker hues reflect higher absolute changes. The mutated position
is highlighted by red dotted lines. (E) Arc plot representations of the base pairing probabilities are analogous to the circular

line) and their differences provide an assessment of the mutation effect on the RNA single-strandedness, which may relate to
its interaction potential with other RNAs or proteins. Accessibility is measured in terms of local single-position unpaired
probabilities [59].

Mutation 29742 occurs in a conserved region within 3′ UTR known as the coronavirus 3' stem-loop II-like motif
(s2m). This mutation has significant effect on secondary structure of the 3′ UTR (Figure 2A & B). It is wellknown that s2m present in most Coronaviruses and plays a vital role in viral replication and invasion [60-62].
Mutations in this region has been shown to increase the stability of 3′ UTR and its interaction with 5′ UTR [61].
G2974U mutation in s2m causes deletion of weak base-pairing and enhances the appearance of stronger basepairing, which result in the loss of a weak loop (Figure 2C, D, E & F). The G29742U mutation increases the RNA
accessibility in s2m (Figure 2G), whilst removing a c-Myc binding site (GCC ACG CGG A). Several SARSCoV-2 encoded genes bind to the host proteins involved in biological processes, such as protein trafficking,
translation, transcription and ubiquitination regulation [63,64]. In addition, s2m interacts with viral and host
proteins such as the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), to regulate viral replication and transcription
[61,62].
Collectively, these results suggest that 1059 and 29742 yield more stable RNA structures. However, the
relationship of changes in RNA secondary structure of Nsp2 and 3′ UTR to viral replication or infectivity must be
tested in adequate experimental assays.

Potential interaction of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and human miRNAs
In addition to previous studies, we have identified several human miRNAs with potential binding sites across
SARS-CoV-2 genome. We filtered our considered miRNA to those with documented expression in SARS-CoV2 target cells (Figure 3 & S2-11) and additionally focused on miRNAs that have been reported as components of
the anti-viral miRNA-mediated defence system. We hypothesised that some mutations may represent escape
mutations to avoid miRNA-mediated defence. As shown in Figure 4, ten mutations occur in miRNA binding site
and abolish the binding of miRNAs to their targets. Only one mutation (C15293U) inside Nsp12 did not destroy
the miR-1273d binding site (GISAID: EPI_ISL_41922).
MiR-197-5p is upregulated in patients with cardiovascular disease and its detection has been proposed as a
biomarker [65-67]. In addition, it is well-known that patients with cardiovascular disease are overrepresented in
symptomatic COVID-19 cohorts and have a higher mortality rate [68]. The C3037U conserved, but synonymous,
mutation within Nsp3 sequence abolished the miR-197-5p target sequence (Figure 4). This mutation was
introduced early January 2020 (Figure S1). This miRNA was previously reported to act in defence against hepatitis
viruses, such as HBV, HCV, HAV and Enterovirus 71 [69-71].
Three mutations within Nsp4 result in loss of miR-3935 and miR-18b-5p target sequences, although they are not
conserved mutations. Both miRNA are expressed in SARS-CoV-2 target cells (Figure 3B, S4 & S5). Nsp4
A9259G is in a sequence obtained from Vietnam (GISAID: EPI_ISL_416429), Nsp4 G9802U was reported in a
Chinese patient [72] and Nsp4 C9803U was identified in the Netherlands (GISAID: EPI_ISL_422940) (Figure
4).
We identified five miRNAs with perfectly-matched complementary sequences within the S-gene: miR-29b-3p,
miR-338-3p, miR-4661-3p, miR-4761-5p and miR-4793-5p (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 4, four of these sites
were altered by recently identified mutations in the S-gene.
In particular, the miR-338-3p miRNA is expressed at high levels in SARS-CoV-2 target cells (Figure 3B, S9).
The miR-338-3p target in the S-gene is removed by the C24034U conserved mutation identified early January in
multiple countries (Figure S1). The miR-338-3p miRNA acts as tumor suppressor in liver, lung and gastric cancers
[73-75]. The expression level of miR-338-3p declines during HBV infection [76,77] and miR-338-3p has a

Of interest, two more conserved mutations C22277A (Q239K) and A23403G (D614G) occur in binding sites for
miR-29b-3p and miR-4793-5p, respectively. Lastly, G25311U in a patient sample isolated India (MT396242.1)
removed the miR-4661-3p binding site within the S gene (Figure 4).

in miRNA binding sites are indicated in red, and the designations of the mutations are shown in red font and conserved
mutations are indicated with an asterix. The figure was produced using IntaRNA tool.

In addition to the sites mentioned here, we identified an additional four host miRNAs with perfect
complementarity within the receptor binding domain (RBD) region of S gene (Figure 5). These miRNA are not
expressed by SARS-CoV-2 target cells (data not shown). However, because these sites exist within the critical
ACE-2 targeting region, these miRNA target sequences may be relevant to miRNA-mediated virus attenuation
technology. For example, viral replication can attenuated in a species-specific and tissue-specific manner by host
miRNA machinery, which controls viral tropism, replication and pathogenesis [30-32].

Possible impact of mutations on cryptic splice sites
Atypical cytoplasmic RNA splicing has been proposed to contribute to non-canonical viral transcripts, even for
viruses that classically replicate in the cytoplasm [23-28]. Moreover, deep RNA sequencing has identified several
previously unidentified SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs that may be the result of non-canonical splicing events, or
alternative transcriptional start sites [29]. We used RegRNA2 [37], HSF [38] and NIPU [39,40] tools to identify
the putative splice sites and motifs within SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our computational prediction identified several
5′ donor and 3′ acceptor splice sites, as well as splice enhancer / inhibitor motifs [79] (Table 2). However, none
of conserved mutations introduced, or deleted, any potential splice sites.

Discussion
At present there are nearly 200 mutations identified within global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. These mutations are
mostly limited to point mutations, with little evidence for recombination events mediating the simultaneous
transfer of multiple mutations. Although mutations may be due RdRp / Nsp12 infidelity, the predominance of C
® U and G ® A mutations is consistent with base-editing defence (e.g. APOBEC / ADAR) [57,80]. The Nsp14
exonuclease-based proof-reader is a critical counter-defence against host base-editor attack on the SARS-CoV-2
genome. It is also possible that the position of mutations within the genome could reflect accessibility of host
base-editors to the SARS-CoV-2 genome upon uncoating, or during genome translation [57].
In our study, we filtered mutations to common / conserved events according to published sources [52]. There is
little evidence that the existing mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have an impact on transmission, replication or viral
load, but our study has flagged potential sites that could impact on viral fitness. It remains to be seen if these
mutations undergo purifying selection in human populations over time. Carriage of SARS-CoV-2 mutations
through the rapid expansion into naive populations throughout the world is most likely due to a neutral founder
effects, rather than from fitness gains. For example, the high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations
is close to the expected value for an emerging virus that has not undergone purifying selection [3].
One of the mutations (A23403G; D614G) in the Spike protein gene studied here defines the rapidly emerging Gclade present in one-third of global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. This mutation has been extensively studied by Korber
et al. with respect to clinical outcomes and viral load [81]. The Korber et al. study showed that the A23403G did
not enhance spike protein binding to ACE-2, however the mutation may be associated with higher viral load and
poorer clinical outcomes. Our own analysis demonstrated that this mutation abolished a potential interaction with
miR-4793-5p, a miRNA highly expressed in target cells including oesophagus, lung epithelium and small

intestine. We propose that the A23403G mutation may represent an escape variant from the action of host miR4793-5p.
Three mutations within Nsp4 were predicted to abolish miR-3935 and miR-18b-5p targeting. The expression of
miR-3935 and miR-18b is altered upon viral infections [82-85]. The expression level of miR-3935 upregulates
during H1N1, Crimean‐Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Coxsackievirus A16 and Enterovirus 71 infection
[82,84,85]. On the other hand, miR-18b was reported to be downregulated during HBV and Ebola virus infections
[83,86]. Similar to what observed for miR-197-5p, both miR-18b and miR-3935 are upregulated in patient with
cardiovascular disease [87-89].
It is not yet clear if anti-viral miRNAs have evolved as host defense against viral infection, or are simply critical
gene regulatory elements that assume an additional role for targeting viral transcripts – particularly when the
human cellular defence machinery is confronted by an emerging zoonotic virus [9,13,14]. The possibility of
including host miRNA binding sites into the genome of live-attenuated viruses offers a further checkpoint for the
further attenuation of live vaccines, in a host-cell specific manner. For example, the identification of miRNA
target sites in viral pathogens opens up opportunities for further study of viral host cell-tropism, or to create cellspecific or species-specific viral vaccines [30-32]. Finally, miRNA sites within the CDS of viral genes may be
critical for ribosomal stalling, leading to the production of pioneer translation products (PTP). Enhanced
production of PTP peptides may be critical for MHC-I loading for boosting the anti-viral CTL response [33-36].
