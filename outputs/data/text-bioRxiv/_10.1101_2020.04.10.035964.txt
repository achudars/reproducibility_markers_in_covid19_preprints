In this study, we analyzed full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from multiple countries to
determine early trends in the evolutionary dynamics of the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Results
indicated SARS-CoV-2 evolved early into at least three phylogenetic groups, characterized by
positive selection at specific residues of the accessory proteins OFR3a and ORF8a. We also
report evidence of epistatic interactions among sites in the genome that may be important in the
generation of variants adapted to humans. These observations might impact not only public
health, but also suggest more studies are needed to understand the genetic mechanisms that may
affect the development of therapeutic and preventive tools, like antivirals and vaccines.

The first case of pneumonia confirmed to be caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 was in a
41-year-old man in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on 31/December/2019 (Wu et al., 2020). As
of 9/April/2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 1,439,516 cases, 85,711
deaths, and the presence of COVID-19 in 209 countries, areas or territories. Of the confirmed
cases, 71% are from seven countries: United States of America (395,030), Spain (146, 690),
Italy (139, 422), Germany (108,202), China (83,249), France (81,095), and Iran (66,220)
(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). As of the writing of this
report, the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase worldwide, with multiple epicenters.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) initially named this pathogen
2019-nCoV (also referred to as COVID-19 by WHO) and included it within the Coronaviridae
viral family (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020).
Later, based on the close phylogenetic relationship of COVID-19 with other human and bat
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), ICTV renamed the virus as
SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of,
2020).

The Coronaviridae family encompasses a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses
with a genome length varying between 27 and 32 kb. These are zoonotic viruses with the
potential to infect humans and animals. Coronaviruses may cause acute and chronic respiratory,
enteric, and central nervous system infections(Phan et al., 2018, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005).
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, a meta-analysis of 50,466 patients indicate that fever and cough are
the most common symptoms (95% CI: 81.8-94.5% and 65.7-78.2%, respectively) (Sun et al.,
2020). The disease may worsen, and the percentages of severe cases and fatality rate vary
between 12.7-24.3% and 2.7-6.1% (95% CI), respectively (Sun et al., 2020).

The genome organization of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to viruses from the genus Betacoronavirus,
one of the four genera included in the Coronaviridae subfamily Orthocoronavirinae. The
~29,903 nucleotide (nt) genome is organized as follows, 5’ to 3’: replicase ORF1ab, S (encoding
the structural spike glycoprotein), ORF3a (ORF3a protein), E (structural envelope protein), M
(structural membrane glycoprotein), ORF6 (ORF6 protein), ORF7a (ORF7a protein), ORF7b
(ORF7b protein), ORF8 (ORF8 protein), N (structural nucleocapsid phosphoprotein), and
ORF10 (ORF10 protein). ORF1ab (~21,291 nt) encodes sixteen non-structural proteins: leader
protein, nsp2, nsp3, nsp4, 3C-like proteinase, nsp6, nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase, helicase, 3’-to 5’ exonuclease, endoRNAse, 2’-o-ribose methyltransferase, and
nsp11(Wu et al., 2020) .

Much speculation regarding the origin of SARS-CoV-2 emanates from unfounded theories, such
as a man-made laboratory origin; however, a recent study supports the hypothesis that SARSCoV-2 was the result of cross-species transmission followed by natural selection in the novel
human host (Andersen et al., 2020). This hypothesis is strongly supported by studies examining
amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 and some phylogenetically related
betacoronaviruses (e.g., Bat-RatG13 isolate and the human SARS-CoV isolate Urbani) at the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, where such differences seem to increase
the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) (Andersen et al., 2020). This increased affinity for binding ACE2 might help to explain
the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations (Wan et al., 2020).

Considering the extraordinary plasticity shown by other human viral RNA pathogens, for
example HIV-1, Influenza viruses, SARS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus, to undergo adaptative
changes to evade innate and adaptive immune responses, develop drug resistance or establish an
infection in a new host (Frost et al., 2018), multiple questions arise regarding the adaptative
changes that SARS-CoV-2 has undergone during the pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 has spread
throughout many countries resulting in the infection of people with diverse immunological
backgrounds and demographics (age, sex, environmental conditions, etc) that potentially impose
significant selective pressures on SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we evaluate the phylogenetic and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during the early
phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using different analyses based on a codon-based
phylogenetic framework, we identified critical sites in the genome undergoing positive selection,
which might favor viral divergence and emergence of multiple viral variants. Our findings are
discussed in terms of the potential effects that the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 might have on
public health.

Eighty-six full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes representing early viral isolates from patients
living in diverse geographic regions were used for this study. Viral sequences, downloaded from
the NCBI GenBank database on 06/03/2020, represent the total number of full-length viral
genomes at the time that the analysis was conducted (Figure 1).

Two phylogeographic trees were reconstructed using the programs BEAST2.4.3, BEAUti, and
TreeAnnotator (Drummond et al., 2012) , introducing the country/region as a trait. The Markov
Chain Monte Carlo was run for 25 million generations, using the HKY85 substitution model and
a gamma distribution with four categories as the site heterogeneity model. The resulting file was
analyzed with Tracer 1.6 to check for convergence and to determine the Burnin proportion
(Rambaut et al., 2018). Finally, TreeAnnotator was used to build the maximum clade credibility
tree,
which

with
FigTree

(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree). Additionally, the evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2,
expressed as substitutions/sites/year, was calculated using the same methodology but using
sampling date as a trait.

Pairwise distance calculations

104
105
106
107
108

Nucleotide and amino acid pairwise distance calculations among SARS-CoV-2 sequences were
conducted using the SSE 1.3 Sequence Distances program (Simmonds, 2012). For this purpose, a
sliding window of 50 nucleotides (nt), with a shift of 25 nt, was used to determine pairwise
distances. Additionally, p-distances in nucleotide and amino acid sequences between
phylogenetic groups were calculated using MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016).

109

Evolutionary rate per site analysis

110
111

113
114

Mean (relative) evolutionary rates for each site in the alignment were estimated under the
General Time Reversible model, including all 3 codon positions. These rates were scaled
considering the average evolutionary rate across all sites is 1. This means that sites showing a
rate <1 are evolving slower than average, and those with a rate >1 are evolving faster than
average. This analysis was conducted using MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016).

Since natural selection can be manifested as different modes (diversifying, directional or

Model of Evolution (MEME) (Murrell et al., 2012), and Fast Unbiased Bayesian Approximation
(FUBAR) (Murrell et al., 2013). These methods use a maximum likelihood or Bayesian approach
(FUBAR) to infer nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates on a per site
basis for given coding alignment and corresponding phylogeny (Weaver et al., 2018). SLAC,
FEL and FUBAR were methods used to identify sites experiencing pervasive diversifying or
purifying selection, while MEME was used to detect sites experiencing episodic diversifying
selection.

130

The presence of recombination in the sequence dataset potentially affecting the detection of
positive selection was assessed using the algorithm GARD (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2006). All
methods were performed on the adaptive evolution server Datamonkey 2.0 (Weaver et al., 2018).

Evidence of directional selection was assessed on amino acid sequences using the Directional
Evolution of Protein Sequences (DEPS) method, implemented on the Datamonkey webserver
(classic) (Delport et al., 2010). This method is a model-based phylogenetic maximum likelihood
test that looks for evidence of preferential substitution toward a given residue at individual
positions of a protein alignment (Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2008).

Coevolution analysis

Evidence of coevolution among different sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was evaluated using
the method Bayesian Graphical Models for co-evolving sites (BGM) (Poon et al., 2007). This
method detects coevolutionary interactions between amino acids in a protein, where amino acid
substitutions are mapped to branches in the phylogenetic tree.

BSM62 was used to infer the biological significance of amino acid replacements found during
the evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2, where positive values reflect that the substitution is
most likely a product of random substitution, while negative values are indicative of selection
(Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992).

To evaluate potential divergence events of SARS-CoV-2, indicating the rise of new variants
early during the pandemic, we reconstructed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 using full-length
genome sequences of viruses collected between late December of 2019 and early March of 2020
from patients infected in different countries around the world. The results of the phylogenetic
analysis demonstrate the rapid divergence of SARS-CoV-2 into three distinct phylogenetic
groups, differentiated only by a few changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels (Figure 2A
and 2B).

Group A includes the deduced ancestral sequence (NC_045512.2) obtained from the index case
in Wuhan, China, and reported to the WHO on 31/December/ 2019, as well as multiple viral
isolates from different Chinese provinces. The position of these sequences among multiple
branches within the Group A cluster suggests the emergence of multiple viral variants in China,
especially from Wuhan before the start of the global pandemic. Furthermore, the basal branch
position of some of these variants indicates that they were the ancestors of viral isolates obtained

Similarly, in the Group B cluster, we found viral isolates from multiple Chinese provinces
between December of 2019 and January of 2020. These isolates are likely ancestors of viral
isolates recovered from patients in the USA, India, and Taiwan between January and March
2020. Interestingly, one isolate from Wuhan (LR757995.1) is part of the Group B cluster,
supporting the hypothesis that multiple viral variants emerged in China before the start of the
pandemic.

The Group C cluster was the only cluster that did not contain sequences from China. This cluster
includes viral isolates collected from the USA, Italy, Australia, Sweden, Brazil, and South Korea
between January and February of 2020. The absence of viral isolates from China and the
increased genetic distance from Group A suggests that the emergence of these variants might
have come from a second wave of transmission outside of China after the start of the pandemic.

Once we reconstructed the phylodynamic of SARS-CoV-2 isolates obtained early during the
pandemic event, we attempted to determine which nucleotide positions in the SARS-CoV-2
genome were related to the early divergence of this virus. Overall, the evolutionary rate of
SARS-CoV-2 is 1.15 x 10-3 substitutions/site/year (95% HPD 7.41 x 10-4 -1.57 x 10-3), while
pairwise analysis at nucleotide and amino acid levels revealed an average identity of 99.9399.98% and 99.86-99.97%, respectively. Given the short divergence time, a high level of identity
is to be expected; however, a few synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions were observed
in the ORF1ab, S, OFR3a M, ORF8a, N and OFR10 genes (Figure 3A and 3B). When pairwise
distances were calculated based on gene length, the highest levels of divergence were observed
within genes ORF10 and ORF8a when considering synonymous and non-synonymous
substitutions, respectively (Figure 3C and 3D).

186
187
188
189

191

Also, the estimated per site evolutionary rate in the coding regions revealed that 98.85% of the
sites in the genome are evolving at expected rates of evolution, while 1.15% of the sites are
evolving faster than expected (Figure 3E). In this context, and consistent with the length of the
OFR1ab gene, most of these synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions (82 sites) were
distributed among different protein-encoding segments of this gene; the segment encoding nsp3
had the highest number of polymorphic sites (Figure 3E).

Detection of purifying and diversifying selection

195
196

Once we identified fast-evolving positions within different genes of SARS-CoV-2, we used a
combination of different algorithms centered on a codon-based phylogenetic framework to detect
specific codons evolving under natural selection. Overall, no recombination events potentially
affecting the results of these analyses were detected using the GARD algorithm.

Using SLAC we obtained a broad picture of the extent of natural selection acting upon the
SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found an overall dN/dS ratio of 0.937 along the genome. In
particular, 75 codons located within 5 genes ( ORF1ab > S > N > ORF8a >ORF3a) showed
evidence of increased fixation of non-synonymous mutations (dN/dS >1). Conversely, a small
number of codons (35 codons) located within 5 genes (ORF1ab > N > S >M = ORF10) were
accumulating a higher number of synonymous mutations (dN/dS <1). Interestingly, evaluation of

dN/dS at the level of individual genes showed higher ratios for the ORF3a and ORF8 genes
(Figure 4A).

Significant purifying (negative) selection was observed in 12 out of the 35 codons evolving at
dN/dS <1 using the FEL (12 sites) and FUBAR (1 site) methods; the codons were located in the
ORF1ab, S, and N genes (Figure 4B). At these codons, increased fixation of synonymous
substitutions seems to be favoring the phenotypic preservation of SARS-CoV-2 at specific
residues of the proteins encoded by these genes. By tracking these mutations within different
isolates, we observed that these changes could explain the divergence of different viruses within
different phylogenetic groups. In some cases, mutations were associated with multiple isolates,
supporting the relevance of these findings.

213
214
215
216

On the other hand, evidence of diversifying positive selection on non-synonymous sites was
detected in just 4 of the 75 codons evolving at dN/dS >1 in genes ORF1ab and ORF3a, with the
FUBAR and FEL methods providing the highest power of detection (Figure 4C). Based on this
analysis, these four sites appear to be evolving under pervasive diversifying selection.

217
218
219
220
221
222

Interestingly, the detection of diversifying selection at codon 3606 (nsp6) was significantly
supported by three different tests. Also, the selection of this site was observed in isolates from
all three phylogenetic groups, thus supporting the reliability of this finding. However, the
conservative nature of the amino acid substitution at this site (L-F; BSM62= 0) suggests this may
not affect the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2. The same pattern was observed in codon 75 (D-E;
BSM62= 2).

223
224
225
226
227

Conversely, based on the nature of the substitution (G-V; BSM62= -3), diversifying selection at
codon 251 of the ORF3a gene may produce a biologically relevant effect on the phenotype of
SARS-CoV-2. The same situation was observed at codon 2244 (I-T; BSM62= -1). Interestingly,
change at codon position 251 is highly conserved within isolates of group C, suggesting that this
change might have promoted the divergence of this group.

228

Detection of directional selection

229
230
231
232
233

To maximize the inference of potential sites experiencing positive selection, amino acid
alignments of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed using the DEPS algorithm. Overall, DEPS identified
a total of 4 amino acid residues that are experiencing directional selection. Of these four
residues, isoleucine (I) has the strongest bias, affecting 16 out of 19 sites evolving via directional
selection (figure 5A).

234
235
236
237
238
239
240
241

The majority of selected sites were located in nonstructural proteins (nsp) encoded by the
ORF1ab gene, with nsp3 accounting for the highest proportion (Figure 5B). Interestingly, a low
proportion of the total number of predicted sites had a conservative amino acid substitution
(residues at positions 902, 1769, 2235, and 2908), suggesting that the majority of substitutions
may have an adaptive effect. In this context, it is remarkable that codon 84 of protein ORF8a is
synapomorphic in all Group B sequences. Also, similar to previous algorithms, DEPS identified
positive selection of residue 251 of ORF3a, supporting the potential significance of this site in
the early evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

Finally, we attempted to find coevolutionary correlations between different codons within the
genome that result in the positive selection of sites. Analysis by BMG produced evidence of 14
coevolving codon pairs; these interactions took place mostly within codons located within the
ORFB1ab gene (Figure 6). Although most of the interactions were detected between
nonsynonymous codons, coevolution between codons 4090-4269 and 818-4320 was detected by
a synonymous substitution at one of the codons. Also, based on the nature of the amino acid
replacement, just 6 of the 14 interactions produced a potential biological significance in the
replacement. Interestingly, 8 of the 14 interactions appeared associated with sites evolving under
some type of positive selection, suggesting that the selection of these sites might be the result of
epistatic events (Figure 7).

Herein, we evaluated the phylogenetic and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during the
first months of the pandemic event in 2020. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed the complex
dynamic of the spread of infection throughout the world, suggesting that multiple viral variants
might have emerged in China before the start of the pandemic event. The evolutionary rate
calculated for SARS-CoV-2 in this study was consistent not only with previous reports for
SARS-CoV (Salemi et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2004), but also with the rate for other RNA viruses
(Sanjuan et al., 2010), explaining the high levels of identity at nucleotide and amino acid levels
calculated for SARS-CoV-2 in our study. In this context, the high conservation observed in the
genome of SARS-CoV-2 early during the pandemic might also be attributed to the unique RNA
correction machinery of coronaviruses (Ferron et al., 2018).

However, and despite the relative genome stability observed in SARS-CoV-2 at this stage of the
pandemic, we were able to describe the existence of 3 phylogenetic groups. Interestingly, our
evolutionary analysis supported the hypothesis regarding early divergence events produced
during the pandemic. By using a combination of different evolutionary algorithms, we detected
multiple codon sites that may be promoting the divergence of SARS-CoV-2. However, two
primary considerations must be addressed regarding the biological relevance of multiple sites
detected in this study. First, a considerable number of polymorphisms were detected in just one
viral isolate, which might be a consequence of the small number of viral isolates available at the
time we started this study. Another possibility is that some of the polymorphisms might be due to
sequencing errors. Additionally, some positively selected sites resulted in conservative
replacements in terms of the similar nature of these amino acids, suggesting that they may not
have a potential biological effect on the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2. However, the last
assumption must be taken with caution, since experimental work on Chikungunya virus has
shown that a conservative replacement of aspartic acid (D) with glutamic acid (E) at residue 350
of the E1 protein is able to alter the affinity of a monoclonal antibody for this site (Tuekprakhon
et al., 2018).

We are reporting three potentially relevant residues that may be driving the evolution of SARSCoV-2 in human populations. Residue 251 of the ORF3a protein appears to be experiencing
diversifying selection and might be related to the emergence of viruses in phylogenetic Group C.
The early selection of this site might have a biological relevance since the ORF3a protein has
been associated with virulence of human coronaviruses by controlling not only the expression of
cytokines and chemokines but also inducing necrotic cell death (Shi et al., 2019).

Also, a residue located at position 84 of the ORF8a protein was found to be evolving under
directional selection and might be related to the emergence of Group B. This protein has been
implicated in viral pathogenesis by regulating the initial innate response (McBride and Fielding,
2012, Shi et al., 2019). Interestingly, ORF3a and ORF8a accessory proteins had the highest
dN/dS, indicating that a positive selective pressure is being exerted on these proteins during the
pandemic.

Based on the known roles in tropism and virulence associated with the helicase of MERS-CoV,
we consider it important to mention codon 5865 (ORF1ab) that was found to be evolving under
directional selection and might be related to the divergence of 5 isolates from Washington, USA,
forming a sub-cluster in Group B.

Finally, our analysis of coevolution revealed some potential epistatic interactions that might be
driving the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the
emergence of an Ebola virus variant in 2014 (Ibeh et al., 2016), and its relevance in the evolution
of coronaviruses should be explored in future studies. Also, it is interesting to mention that most
of the co-evolving sites were located in nsp3; given the role of this protein in the virulence of
coronaviruses (Fehr et al., 2015), this observation may be key in understanding the evolution of
SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, since two of the interactions detected by BGM were associated with
synonymous mutations, the relevance of this type of substitution to viral fitness should not be
underestimated, since selection of synonymous substitutions has been reported in other RNA
viruses like VSV (Novella et al., 2004, Velazquez-Salinas et al., 2018).

Collectively, our results describe the early evolutionary events of SARS-CoV-2 during the
current pandemic and the findings may support the hypothesis that different variants of SARSCoV-2 with disparate levels of virulence might be circulating in the world. This possibility
might have an important impact on public health and measures to control the pandemic.
Subsequent studies using reverse genetics will be needed to confirm the relevance of our findings
connecting specific residue substitutions with different virus phenotypes.
