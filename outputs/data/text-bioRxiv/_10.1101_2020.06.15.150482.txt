Abstract

29

Since the first recorded case of the SARS-CoV-2, it has acquired several mutations in its

30

genome while spreading throughout the globe. However, apart from some changes in protein

31

coding, functional importance of these mutations in disease pathophysiology are still largely

32

unknown. In this study, we investigated the significance of these mutations both from the

33

host’s and virus’s perspective by analyzing the host miRNA binding and virus’s internal

34

ribosome entry site (IRES), respectively. Strikingly, we observed that due to the acquired

35

mutations, host miRNAs bind differently compared to the reference; where few of the

36

miRNAs lost and few gained the binding affinity for targeting the viral genome. Moreover,

37

functional enrichment analysis suggests that targets of both of these gained and lost miRNAs

38

might be involved in various host immune signaling pathways. Also, we sought to shed some

39

insights on the impacts of mutations on the IRES structure of SARS-CoV-2. Remarkably, we

40

detected that three particular mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary structure which

41

can further make the virus less functional. These results could be valuable in exploring the

42

functional importance of the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and could provide novel insights into

43

the differences observed different parts of the world.

Introduction

57

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has posed a serious threat to the public health sector around

58

the whole globe as it has already spread to 213 countries/territories. Approximately, 7.8

59

million people got infected with SARS-CoV-2 and half a million suffered death from this till

60

the date of writing this article [1]. The woes of this pandemic are still on the rise as the

61

detailed molecular aspects of the pathogenesis are still intangible.

62

Since the reporting of the first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, a huge number of genomes

63

are being sequenced everyday. Comparing to the reference, genome sequences from different

64

parts of the globe have suggested that this virus might have been acquiring many sequence

65

alterations while spreading. But the functional significance of these variations are largely

66

unknown and are not well-correlated with the disease pathobiology or infectivity.

67

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) which can play important roles during a

68

viral infection. miRNAs can provide benefit for the host by exerting antiviral mechanisms

69

through the innate and adaptive immune systems [2]; on the other hand, they can also

70

facilitate the viral propagation by negatively modulating the host immune responses [3]. It

71

was also reported that mutations in the miRNA binding sites in the viral genome can expedite

72

the viral proliferation during an infection [2].

73

Ribosomal frame-shifting using the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) has previously been

74

reported as important for coronaviruses as they use this site for synthesizing their proteins

75

[4]. Moreover, alterations in the IRES can result in lethal effects on the SARS-CoV

76

propagation and life-cycle [5]. Kelly et al. suggested that SARS-CoV-2 possess similar IRES

77

structure like SARS-CoV [6].

78

In this present study, we sought to find out the comparative effects of the SARS-CoV-2

79

genome mutations on the basis of the host miRNA targeting profiles and IRES alterations.

80

We illuminated the putative alterations of the host-miRNA binding profiles that might have

81

arose due to the acquired mutations in different world-wide isolates. Also, the probable

82

structural alterations due to the variations in SARS-CoV-2 IRES were investigated.

83

Materials and Methods

84

Mining of SNPs and their world-wide frequencies

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.150482; this version posted June 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

85

We extracted the SNPs of SARS-CoV-2 which have world-wide frequency ≥ 10 for the

86

miRNA binding analysis; while for analyzing the effects on IRES structure, we took all SNPs

87

found in the IRES region of SARS-CoV-2. We obtained these information from “The 2019

88

Novel Coronavirus Resource” database along with the SNP annotations as on 30th April,

89

2020 which included information from 8614 “High quality” (As set by GISAID database:

90

Complete and high coverage sequences only with < 1% Ns, <0.05% unique amino acid

91

mutations, and no insertion or deletion unless confirmed by submitter) SARS-CoV-2

92

genomes [7].

93

Viral RNA-host miRNA interaction analysis

94

We have only taken fragmented viral sequences around our targeted viral reference sequence

95

and SNPs (20 nts upstream and 20 nts downstream of a SNP) for the interaction analysis.

96

Then we used three different tools, namely- RNAhybrid [8], miRanda [9], IntaRNA [10] for

97

analyzing the miRNA-RNA interaction. We considered those as high confidence interaction

98

when it has been predicted by every tools that we used and have values- (i) for RNAhybrid:

99

MFE ≥ -35 KJ/mol and p-value < .001, (ii) for miRanda: energy ≥ -15 KJ/mol, (iii) for

100

IntaRNA: ΔΔG ≤ -15 KJ/mol. We compiled the commonly predicted miRNAs from these

101

three tools using the respective abovementioned cut-offs to reduce the false positives

102

predictions.

103

Retrieval of country-wise COVID-19 statistics

104

COVID-19 related statistics (Total deaths, Deaths/1 Million population, Case fatality rate)

105

from different countries were extracted from the Worldometer website [1] on 24th April,

106

2020. We presented the country-wise COVID-19 fatality statistics along with the miRNA

107

binding profiles around the targeted SNPs of the associated country.

108

Target genes functional enrichment analysis

109

We performed the functional enrichment of the experimentally validated targets (obtained

110

from mirTarBase database [11]) of miRNAs that can bind around the SNPs of SARS-CoV-2

111

using Gitools v1.8.4 [12] utilizing KEGG and Bioplanet pathway modules. Resulting p-

112

values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamin and Hochberg's method of False

113

Discovery Rate (FDR).

114

Prediction of the secondary structures of the IRES

115

The coordinates of the experimentally validated IRES of SARS-CoV-2 was extracted from

116

previously conducted study [6] and adjusted accordingly. While predicting the secondary

117

structures of the IRES incorporating the reference and the mutated bases, we took 50

118

additional nucleotides both upstream and downstream from the coordinates of the IRES. We

119

used RNAfold tool [13] for the prediction of the IRES secondary structures.

120
121

Results and Discussion

122

We have obtained 377 high confidence (mutation frequency ≥10) SNPs from the database

123

and used the regions around those for miRNA binding analysis (Data not shown). Not all

124

SNPs could alter the miRNA binding affinity. Ten miRNAs were observed to bind both the

125

targeted reference and mutated regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Supplementary file 1).

126

Five miRNAs were found to bind only the regions of the reference genome which were not

127

found significant for the mutated sequences, where 5 different other miRNAs can bind to the

128

regions around the observed mutations but not found in the reference sequences (Figure 1).

129

We have considered the miRNAs as “Gained” ones which can bind the mutated sequences;

130

and miRNAs which were not found to bind the mutated sequences but can bind the reference

131

are termed as “Lost” miRNAs. Most of the miRNAs binding were observed for the targeted

132

regions of the N and ORF1ab gene sequence. Also, miRNAs were also found to bind the

133

targeted regions of ORF3a, ORF7a, and 3’UTR (Figure 1).

134

We observed that the countries in which these mutations were much prevalent

135

(Supplementary file 2), a less number of miRNAs can bind to the SARS-CoV-2

136

genome/transcripts due to the acquired mutations, whereas these miRNAs can bind to the

137

associated reference sequences (Figure 1). It was also detected that countries having high

138

fatalities from COVID-19 have more mutations, and maybe these mutations can resist the

139

binding of host miRNAs and giving those viruses with the mutations a competitive edge over

140

the reference virus. Still, more experimental evidences should be searched in order to find out

141

the definitive roles of these mutations in escaping from the host antiviral miRNAs.

142

Moreover, the functional enrichment analysis using the targets of these found miRNAs

143

suggested that due to the loss of miRNA binding can impact the host adaptive and innate

144

immune signaling pathways, hypoxia response etc. (Figure 2A-B); whereas targets of the

145

gained miRNAs for the mutations are also involved in pathways like- interleukin signaling,

146

autophagy etc. (Figure 2A-B). So, the acquired mutations can lead to the alterations in

147

miRNAs which can in turn result in the altered host immune responses during the viral

148

infection.

149

We scrutinized 19 mutations in the IRES region of SARS-CoV-2 which was previously

150

defined by Kelly et al. [6]. We aimed to illustrate the impact of the mutations in the

151

secondary structure of the IRES of SARS-CoV-2 and predicted the secondary structures

152

using RNAfold tool [13]. Interestingly, we observed that among the 19 mutations, 3 can

153

significantly alter the secondary structure of the IRES of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2C). These 3

154

mutations in the IRES region are 13487: C>T, 13506: C>T, and 13507: G>A (Supplementary

155

file 3). Mutations in these positions can destroy the viral translation process and render the

156

virus less virulent. As, the studies regarding the IRES alterations are still in infancy, so more

157

targeted researches should be conducted to elucidate the functional importance of these

158

variations.

159

In our current analysis, we focused on the functional significance of the mutations reported

160

for SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of host miRNA binding and the putative alterations in the

161

IRES structure. Our preliminary results can suggest that these mutations can alter the binding

162

pattern of host miRNAs which can ultimately result in alternative responses from these

163

binding. Also, we revealed that several mutations in the IRES can disrupt its secondary

164

structure which might suggest why the virus is affecting less in some countries compared to

165

the others. Taking these observations in count, further studies should be conducted to

166

completely understand the functional effects of the acquired mutations in the SARS-CoV-2

167

genome, and integration of other clinical information with these results can provide more

168

insights on the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
