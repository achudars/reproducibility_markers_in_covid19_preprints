ABSTRACT
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recent global pandemic. It is a deadly human viral
disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with
a high rate of infection, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a great urgency to develop
new therapies to control, treat and prevent this disease. Endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs,
miRs) of the viral host are key molecules in preventing viral entry and replication, and building
an antiviral cellular defense. Here, we have analyzed the role of miR-155, one of the most
powerful drivers of host antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses, in
the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequently, we have analyzed the potency of
anti-miR-155 therapy in a COVID-19 mouse model (mice transgenic for human angiotensin Iconverting enzyme 2 receptor (tg-mice hACE2)). We report for the first time that miR-155
expression is elevated in COVID-19 patients. Further, our data indicate that the viral load as
well as miR-155 levels are higher in male relative to female patients. Moreover, we find that
the delivery of anti-miR-155 to SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 effectively suppresses
miR-155 expression, and leads to improved survival and clinical scores. Importantly, anti-miR155-treated tg-mice hACE2 infected with SARS-CoV-2 not only exhibit reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines, but also have increased anti-viral and anti-inflammatory cytokine
responses in the lungs. Thus, our study suggests anti-miR-155 as a novel therapy for mitigating
the lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening human viral disease, caused by the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and accountable for the high
rate of infection, hospitalization, morbidity and mortality around the world. The outbreak of
this deadly human viral pathogen was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China
(1, 2). Subsequently, due to its exceedingly high rate of human-to-human transmission and
infection, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly transmitted throughout the world with a very high prevalence,
leading to a global pandemic. As of December 8, 2020, almost all (177) countries/regions have
reported more than 67,781,393 cases of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 1,548,516
deaths,

worldwide,

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) (3). Therefore, there is great urgency to curb the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 and treat infected patients, by developing new therapies to control, treat and
prevent this disease. To date, a diverse array of therapeutics COVID-19 is in phase three
clinical trial to, such as two mRNA-based vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273 (NIAID and
Moderna, Inc.) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer and BioNTech), and a vaccine developed against the
SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein, AZD1222 (University of Oxford and AstraZeneca). Despite
the rapid pace with which researchers and manufacturers are moving potential therapeutics into
clinical trials, developing effective countermeasures against COVID-19 remains an unmet
goal.
The upper respiratory tract is the main site for active replication of SARS-CoV-2, and
the severity of the disease depends upon the expression of the viral receptor by lung epithelial
cells (4-6). Further, increased inflammatory responses and cytokine storm (such as interleukin
(IL)-1β IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF)) have been reported in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients (7-9). In addition, elevated

expression of numerous chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), interferonγ inducible protein 10 (IP10) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (MIP1-α)) have also
been reported in COVID-19 patients (7, 9, 10). These investigations clearly indicate that the
expression of viral specific-receptor by lung epithelial cells have a key role in the entry of
SARS-CoV-2 and during infection, immune responses have a critical function in the regulation
of inflammation. Therefore, preventing virus entry or replication and/or reinstating or
modulating host immunity responses can open a new avenue to control, treat and prevent
COVID-19.
Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), short (~22 nucleotides) endogenous noncoding RNAs, have emerged as prominent regulators of human defense mechanisms in airway
inflammation, lung diseases as well as in various acute respiratory distress syndromes (ARDS).
Importantly, in viral infection and disease, the host’s endogenous miRNAs have a decisive
function in preventing viral entry and replication either by direct degradation of viral RNA or
suppression of translation of proteins involved in replication (11, 12). Furthermore, miRNAs
play a predominant role in building antiviral cellular defense and are critical regulators of host
immunity and inflammatory responses by inducing mRNA degradation and/or repressing
mRNA translation of target genes (13, 14). Over 60% of human genes are targets of miRNAs
and are regulated by miRNAs (15, 16). Altered expression of specific miRNAs have been
demonstrated in a variety of human diseases including cancer, heart disease, immunological
disorders, and diabetes (17-22). Notably, studies have illustrated the association of several
miRNAs with immune response against various respiratory viruses such as influenza virus
(IV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (hRV), human metapneumovirus
(hMPV), and human coronavirus (HcoV) (12, 23, 24). Some miRNAs regulate levels of
immunomodulating factors and suppress or promote inflammatory responses (25). Moreover,
since a single miRNA targets multiple genes and modulates the expression of these genes, the

best way to nullify the consequence of a dysregulated miRNA in diseased cells, is to restore or
inhibit expression (26). Single miRNAs have been shown to stimulate therapeutic responses in
animal disease models as well as in human clinical trials (26-29). Therefore, miRNA
replacement or inhibitor-based therapeutic mechanisms can be exploited to prevent viral entry
or replication and/or restore or modulate host immune responses against COVID-19.
MiR-155, a well-studied miRNA, is one of the most powerful regulators of host
antiviral responses including immune and inflammatory responses (30-33). In recent years,
numerous studies have clearly established that miR-155 is evolutionarily conserved and during
viral infections, its expression is consistently elevated in different cell systems in both human
and animal models (34-39). Furthermore, the role of elevated miR-155 is also correlated with
lung inflammation, severity of disease and higher mortality in animal models of ARDS (4043). Interestingly, suppression of miR-155 reduces lung inflammation and induce more rapid
recovery of mice infected with respiratory viral pathogens (42, 43). Likewise, knock out (KO)
of miR-155 or treatment with anti-miR-155 suppresses cigarette smoke-induced lung
inflammation in mice models (44). These studies emphasize the role of miR-155 in the
modulation of host defense responses during respiratory virus infection.
Here, we have analyzed the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and expression level of miR155 in nasopharyngeal samples of COVID-19 patients. Further, we have evaluated the effect
of anti-miR-155 treatment on SARS-CoV-2-infected COVID-19 mouse model, mice
transgenic for human angiotensin I- converting enzyme 2 receptor (tg-mice hACE2, tg-mice).
Our data indicate that miR-155 expression is significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients.
Interestingly, a relatively higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load and miR-155 expression are observed
in male COVID-19 patients compared to female patients. Further, our data demonstrate that
treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice with anti-miR-155 is effective in suppression of
miR-155 expression in the lung tissues, and also promotes improved survival as well as a slight

increase in body weight. Moreover, anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice have reduced expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as increased anti-viral and anti-inflammatory cytokines
responses in the lungs. These data collectively suggest anti-miR-155 as a novel therapy for
mitigating the lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
RESULTS
Higher viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive male patients
In order to determine the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients, a total of 99 human
subjects were examined using nasopharyngeal swabs. The isolated RNA was analyzed using
COVID-19 RT-PCR diagnostic kit with probes specific for SARS-CoV-2 genes encoded by
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp/ORF1ab), Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S)
protein. Expression of MS2 phage was used as an internal control. From a total of 99 human
subjects, 59 (21 male and 38 female; median age, 33 years; range, 12 to 70) tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 infection and 40 (18 male and 22 female; median age, 30 years; range, 13 to 84)
tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data indicate that the mean Ct±SEM value for
ORF1ab, N and S gene were 21.83±0.84, 23.84±0.84 and 21.36±0.90, respectively, in COVID19 positive patients (Fig. 1A). Further, in the gender-wise grouping analyses, lower Ct values
of SARS-CoV-2 genes was observed in male (n=21) relative to female (n=38) patients (Fig.
1B), indicating that SARS-CoV-2 viral load is higher in male compared to female COVID-19
patients. However, we acknowledge that larger sample size is required to establish these
observations.
Elevated miR-155 expression in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
We analyzed the expression level of miR-155 in the RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs
of 99 human subjects (59 positive and 40 negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection) examined for
SARS-CoV-2. We find that miR-155 is significantly elevated in patients who tested positive

relative to those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, 34% (n=20) of
the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection showed ≥ 2-fold upregulation of miR-155
relative to those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figs. 2A and 2B). Further,
in the gender-wise grouping analyses, the level of miR-155 expression is higher in male (n=21,
positive versus n=18 negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection) relative to female (n=38, positive
versus n=22, negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection) patients (Fig. 2C). These results indicate
that miR-155 is a potential target for COVID-19 therapy.
Delivery of anti-miR-155 suppressed miR-155 expression in lung tissues of SARS-CoV-2infected tg-mice hACE2
We evaluated the efficacy of in vivo delivery of anti-miR-155 to the lungs of SARS-CoV-2infected tg-mice hACE2 (strain 034860 B6.Cg-TG (K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J), obtained from
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Tg-mice hACE2 (8-10-week-old) were infected
via intranasal injection with 2.8 X 103 plaque-forming units (pfu) of SARS-CoV-2 strain USAWA1/2020 (BEI Resources NR-52281, batch #70033175). Subsequently, the tg-mice were
treated with anti-miR-155 or anti-miR-control (scrambled control) via retro-orbital injection at
a dose of 25 mg/kg body weight (BW) in 50 μL PBS on 0- and 4-days post-infection (dpi).
Total RNA was isolated from the lungs of tg-mice and the expression of miR-155 was
measured using miR-155-specifc Taqman assay. As depicted in Fig. 3A, a significant
suppression of miR-155 (~30%) is observed in the lung tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected antimiR-155-treated tg-mice (n=6) compared to anti-miR-control tg-mice (n=3). These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of anti-miR-155, administered via retro-orbital injection, in
suppressing miR-155 in the lung tissues of SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice. The dose and
administration regime will have to be further optimized.

Improved survival and body weight of SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice after treatment
with anti-miR-155
We examined the effect of anti-miR-155 treatment on BW and survival of tg-mice hACE2
infected with SARS-CoV-2. The anti-miR-155-treated infected tg-mice (n=6) had relatively
higher survival compared to the anti-miR-control-treated mice (n=3) (Fig. 3B). All control
mice succumbed to infection and were euthanized on 5 dpi, while the anti-miR-treated tg-mice
survived a day longer and succumbed to infection and were euthanized on 6 dpi. Further, we
observed that the anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice showed a slight increase in or stable BW (with
a peak during days 2-4), compared to control tg-mice (Fig. 3C). However, subsequently the
animals from both anti-miR-155-treated and control group developed clinical signs of disease
(weight loss, mild ruffled and hunched back, lethargic, not alert and difficulty breathing). From
4 dpi onwards, SARS-CoV-2-infected anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice as well as control mice
displayed a rapid reduction in BW (Fig. 3C). These results emphasize the role of anti-miR155-based therapeutics for COVID-19 and suggests that perhaps a more frequent
administration regime, i.e., treatment on alternate days post-infection, could improve the
therapeutic efficacy.
Altered levels of inflammatory mediators in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice
treated with anti-miR-155
We evaluated the responses of anti-miR-155 treatment on cytokine and chemokine profile in
the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice. Comprehensive analyses of cytokine profile
(Luminex, 36-plex MILLIPLEX® MAP Mouse Cytokine/ Chemokine Magnetic Bead kit,
EMD Millipore) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid indicate attenuation of the
“cytokine storm” in anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice (n=5) compared to control mice (n=1). We
were unable to obtain BAL fluid from one of the treated tg-mice and 2 control tg-mice. The

data indicate significant downregulation of cytokines and chemokines including G-CSF, IL1α, IL-9, IL-12 (p70), KC, LIX, MIP-2, and VEGF (Fig. 4). Additionally, other cytokines,
which are relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as eotaxin, IFN-𝛾, IP-10, MCP-1, M-CSF,
MIG, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNF-α are induced in anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice compared to
control tg-mice (Fig. 5). Importantly, a significant elevation of IFN-𝛾, IP-10, and TNF-α
suggests the antiviral potency of anti-miR-155 in addition to its anti-inflammatory efficacy in
the tg-mice model of COVID-19. These data collectively suggest the anti-inflammatory as well
as the anti-viral potency of anti-miR-155 therapy for COVID-19.
DISCUSSION
From the beginning of this year 2020, the entire world is facing challenges to human health as
well as an economic threat because of COVID-19, a deadly human disease caused by a viral
pathogen SARS-CoV-2. This had created a global urgency for developing therapeutics against
this life-threatening pathogen to control, treat and prevent COVID-19. Currently, many
therapeutics strategies are in phase three clinical trials, such as mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, and
AZD1222. Despite these recent advances, developing effective countermeasures against this
lethal pathogen remains an unmet goal.
SARS-CoV-2 infection primarily affects the lungs and exacerbates host immune and
inflammatory responses, which is one of predominant cause for increased cellular damage,
severity of disease and death (45, 46). Several studies have illustrated the potential of miRNAs,
including miR-155 in the regulation of antiviral cellular defense mechanisms and mitigation of
infections caused by viral pathogens (30-33, 43, 47-53). However, to date there are no reports
of the impact of miR-155 on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here, we investigated the expression of
miR-155 in the nasopharyngeal samples of COVID-19 patients. Our data indicate significant
upregulation of miR-155 expression in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients compared to those who

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.17.423130; this version posted December 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

tested negative. Interestingly, we observed higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load and higher
upregulation of miR-155 in SARS-CoV-2 positive male relative to the female patients.
However, to establish the gender effect observed analyses of a larger number of patients is
required. Consistent with our data, miR-155 has been shown to be induced in the SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 lung cell line (54). Another report indicates that only two miRNAs, including
miR-155-3p and miR-139-5p, are upregulated in lung epithelial cells upon SARS-CoV-2infection with a significant prediction score (55). Furthermore, recent studies have clearly
established that miR-155 is evolutionarily-conserved and during viral infections, its expression
is consistently elevated in animal and human models (34-39). Our findings, significantly
elevated expression of miR-155 in COVID-19 patients, strongly suggest the regulatory role of
miR-155 during SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, the elevated expression of miR-155 has been correlated with the severity
of disease in ARDS. To define the role of miR-155 during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, we
further evaluated the effect of anti-miR-155 treatment on SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice
hACE2. The wild-type mice are not suitable animal models for studying SARS-CoV-2
infection or the resulting pathologies because the virus does not bind as effectively to the
murine ACE2 protein receptor as to ACE2 receptors in humans and several other species.
However, tg-mice hACE2 develops severe disease following infection with betacoronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (56-58). Our data demonstrate significant suppression
of miR-155 expression in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice
relative to control tg-mice, which establishes the in vivo delivery efficacy as well as the
effectiveness of anti-miR-155 treatment (administered via retro-orbital injection). Further, the
anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice exhibited a slight increase in or stable BW compare to the control
tg-mice. However, subsequently both anti-miR-155-treated and control groups of animals
developed clinical signs of disease (weight loss, mild ruffled and hunched back, lethargic, not

alert and difficulty breathing). From 4 dpi, both SARS-CoV-2-infected anti-miR-155-treated
and control tg-mice displayed a rapid reduction in BW. Our findings are consistent with
previous studies which have reported low survival and significant weight loss in SARS-CoV2-infected tg-mice (58, 59). Additionally, our results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-infected
anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice showed slightly improved survival compared to control tg-mice.
Studies on viral infections associated with ARDS have reported that the elevated expression of
miR-155 in whole lung tissue is linked to higher mortality and severity of disease in mice (4043). Furthermore, deletion or suppression of miR-155 has been also correlated with decreased
lung inflammation and increased recovery of mice infected with respiratory viral pathogens
(42, 43). The impact of anti-miR-155 treatment in promoting increased survival and BW of
mice suggest a vital role of miR-155 in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Further, our data
also indicate that perhaps a more frequent administration regime, i.e., treatment on alternate
days post-infection, could improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-miR-155.
The high mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients has been associated with
aggressive inflammatory responses and exaggerated immune responses termed as a cytokine
storm. The cytokine storm is characterized by excessive production of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, G-CSF,
GM-CSF, MCP1, IP10 and MIP1α) (7, 9, 10, 46, 60-63). The role of miR-155 is wellestablished in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during numerous
viral diseases including ARDS. Therefore, we hypothesized that suppression of miR-155
expression could attenuate excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines and thereby, mitigate the lung cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2-infection.
With this hypothesis, we further evaluated the responses of anti-miR-155 treatment on cytokine
and chemokine expression profile in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice. The tg-mice
infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibits increased pro-inflammatory responses as observed in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.17.423130; this version posted December 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

COVID-19 patients (57, 58). The tg-mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 has increased serum
protein levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 as well as the MCP-1 (CCL2) and MCP-3 (CCL7) in
the lung homogenates (57). Additionally, the SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice also have
increased protein levels of interferon-β (IFN-β), IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, C–X–C motif
chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1), CXCL9, CXCL10, chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3, CCL4,
CCL5, CCL12, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, TNF-α and G-CSF in the lungs (58).
Our data indicate that in SARS-CoV-2-infected anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice, BALF
inflammatory mediator (cytokines and chemokines) levels are altered with the decrease in GCSF, IL-1α, IL-9, IL-12 (p70), KC, LIX, MIP-2, and VEGF and increase in eotaxin, IFN-𝛾,
IP-10, MCP-1, M-CSF, MIG, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNF-α. Importantly, we observed a
significant elevation of IFN-𝛾, IP-10, and TNF-α, suggesting the antiviral potency of anti-miR155 in addition to its anti-inflammatory efficacy in the tg-mice model of COVID-19.
Previously, Golden et al. also reported the decreased expressions of Type I and type II IFN
transcripts IFNA1, IFNB1, and IFNG, along with the cytokines IL-9 and IL-2 in the lung
homogenates of tg-mice upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (57). Similarly, Winkler et al. also
reported the variation in the expressions of various cytokines and chemokines in the lungs of
SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice, while some are increased, some showed no change, and others
rapidly increased or decreased following infection (58).
CONCLUSION
MiR-155 is elevated in the nasopharyngeal samples of COVID-19 patients. The in vivo
suppression of miR-155 in SARS-CoV-2-infected tg-mice hACE2 promotes improved survival
and can mitigate the cytokine storm and lung inflammation. Thus, our study suggests antimiR-155 as a novel therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.

METHODS
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and measurement of viral load in human patients
Ninety-nine human subjects (39 male and 60 female; median age, 32 years; range, 12 to 84 ),
who were examined for SARS-CoV-2 infection at OPKO Health Company (GeneDx, Inc.,
MD, USA) were included in this study. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected in 3mL
of standard viral transportation media (VTM). Tubes containing the swab and VTM were
pulse-vortexed three times and 1.5mL aliquots were collected onto low protein binding tubes
(ThermoFisher cat# 88379). Tubes were then centrifuged at 4⁰C for 10 minutes at 1500g. VTM
was carefully removed from the tubes and RNA was extracted from pelleted cells. The
detection and measurement of SARS-CoV-2 viral load were performed using COVID-19 RTPCR diagnostic kit with specific Taqman probes (ThermoFisher) of SARS-CoV-2-specific
genes encoded by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp/ORF1ab), Nucleocapsid (N)
and spike (S) protein. MS2 phage was used as an internal control. The expression of the SARSCoV-2 genes was analyzed by the corresponding Ct values, which are inversely proportional
to the viral load.
Measurement of miR-155 expression in human patients
For analyses of miRNA expression, the RNA was extracted from the VTM using the
RNAqueous Micro Kit (ThermoFisher), following manufacturer specifications. During RNA
isolation, 100fmol of cel-miR-39 RNA (Ambion) was added as spike-in-control.

The

expression of miR-155 and cel-miR-39 were analyzed by specific Taqman assays
(ThermoFisher). Cel-miR-39 was used as an endogenous control to normalize expression. The
relative fold changes of miR-155 were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCT method.

Mouse model
Eight to ten weeks old mice transgenic for human angiotensin I- converting enzyme 2 receptor
(tg-mice hACE2, tg-mice; average weight =22 gm) strain 034860 B6.Cg-TG(K18ACE2)2Prlmn/J were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Animals
were housed in groups of five animals per cage and fed standard chow diets.

All the

experiments with live virus challenge were carried out at BIOQUAL Inc. (Rockville, MD,
USA) bio-safety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities in compliance with local, state, and federal
regulations under IACUC protocol #20-083.
Virus challenge
SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 (BEI Resources NR-52281, batch #70033175), courtesy
of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), was used for mice infection. The
SARS-COV-2 stock was expanded in Vero E6 cells, and the challenging virus was collected
at day 5 of culture when the infection reached 90% cytopathic effect. The full viral genome
sequence showed 100% identity with the parent virus sequence listed in GenBank
(MN985325.1). A plaque-forming assay was carried out in confluent layers of Vero E6 cells
and used to determine the concentration of live virions, reported as plaque-forming units (pfu).
Virus challenge was performed in tg-mice hACE2 via intranasal injection with 2.8 X 103 pfu
of SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal administration was performed by anesthetizing the animal with
Ketamine/ Xylazine. Animals are returned to their housing unit and monitored until fully
recovered from the procedure. Bodyweight and clinical observations were monitored daily
during the experimental period.
Administration regime for anti-miR-155
SARS-CoV-2-infected tg -mice hACE2 were treated with anti-miR-155 at a dose of 25 mg /kg
(for an average weight of 22 g per mouse) in 50 μL PBS at 0- and 4- days post-infection (dpi)

via Retro-Orbital (RO) injections. A set of control infected tg-mice (n=3) were treated similarly
with anti-miR (scrambled)-control. Following the infection of tg-mice with SARS-CoV-2, the
lungs from the set of control tg-mice treated with anti-miR (scrambled)-control were isolated
on 5 dpi, and the lungs from the anti-miR-155-treated tg-mice were isolated on 6 dpi. All
isolated lungs from control and treated tg-mice were immediately snap-frozen over dry ice and
stored at -80ᴼC.
Measurement of miR-155 expression in animals
The total RNA was isolated from frozen lung tissues using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen Inc.,
Carlsbad, CA) with a mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Ambion, AM1561) and quantitated
using Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific). MiRNAs analysis was performed with specific Taqman
probes and U6 was used as an endogenous control to normalize expression of miR-155. The
relative fold changes of miR-155 were analyzed using the 2-ΔΔCT method.
Measurement of cytokine and chemokines
The level of cytokine and chemokines protein in BAL samples from anti-miR-155-treated tgmice hACE2 and anti-miR (scrambled)-control tg-mice hACE2 were analyzed by Luminex
multiplex assays using 36-plex MILLIPLEX® MAP Mouse Cytokine / Chemokine Magnetic
Bead kit, (EMD Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for viral load and miR-155 expression was performed using Excel. The
data represents average Ct values or fold changes with the standard error of the mean (mean ±
SEM). The percent change in body weight, Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and alteration in
cytokine expression in the experimental compared to control mice were analyzed with Prism
version 8 (GraphPad).
