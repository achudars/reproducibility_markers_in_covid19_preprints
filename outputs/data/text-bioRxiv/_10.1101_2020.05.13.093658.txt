Abstract

24

The Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), reservoir host of severe acute

25

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), carries many bat SARS-related CoVs

26

(SARSr-CoVs) with high genetic diversity, particularly in the spike gene. Despite

27

these variations, some bat SARSr-CoVs can utilize the orthologs of human

28

SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entry. It is

29

speculated that the interaction between bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike proteins

30

drives diversity. Here, we have identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with

31

some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein.

32

Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different

33

infection efficiency in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. Consistent

34

results were observed by binding affinity assays between SARS- and SARSr-CoV

35

spike proteins and receptor molecules from bats and humans. All tested bat

36

SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat

37

ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2

38

compared with their SARS-CoV counterpart. Structure modeling revealed that the

39

difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the

40

alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. Molecular

41

evolution analysis indicates that these residues were under strong positive selection.

42

These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may

43

have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other,

triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics. It further proves that R. sinicus is the

45

natural host of SARSr-CoVs.

Importance

48

Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors.

49

Identification of key residues which are involved in interspecies transmission is

50

important to predict potential pathogen spillover from wildlife to humans. Previously,

51

we have identified genetically diverse SARSr-CoV in Chinese horseshoe bats. Here,

52

we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. These

53

ACE2 variants support SARS- and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding

54

affinity to different spike proteins. The higher binding affinity of SARSr-CoV spike to

55

human ACE2 suggests that these viruses have the capacity of spillover to humans.

56

The positive selection of residues at the interface between ACE2 and SARSr-CoV

57

spike protein suggests a long-term and ongoing coevolutionary dynamics between

58

them. Continued surveillance of this group of viruses in bats is necessary for the

59

prevention of the next SARS-like disease.

Introduction

62

Coronaviruses belong to the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily and Coronaviridae

63

family. They are enveloped viruses and contain a positive-sense and single-stranded

64

RNA genome. There are four genera in this subfamily, Alphacoronavirus,

65

Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronavirus and

66

Betacoronavirus are believed to have originated in bats or rodents while

67

Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus in birds (1, 2). Since the beginning of the

68

21st century, three betacoronaviruses have caused outbreaks of severe pneumonia in

69

humans. These are, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)

70

(3-5), the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (6) and the

71

ongoing 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (7).

72

The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has brought back memories of SARS-CoV that

73

occurred 17 years ago in China. SARS is a zoonosis, as demonstrated by the

74

identification of an almost identical coronavirus present in market civets in

75

Guangdong province, China (8). In the following years, genetically diverse

76

SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) were detected or isolated from horseshoe

77

bats from different regions of China and Europe (9-18). Bat SARSr-CoVs share 78–

78

96% nucleotide sequence identity with human and civet SARS-CoVs, with the most

79

variable regions encoding the spike protein (S) and accessory protein ORF3 and 8 (17,

80

19). Moreover, we have identified all the building blocks of SARS-CoV in the

81

genome of different bat SARSr-CoVs and suggest that the ancestor of SARS-CoV

82

originated in bats through the recombination of bat SARSr-CoV genomes (17, 19).

83

The first and essential step of virus infection is cell receptor recognition. The entry

84

of the coronavirus is mediated by specific interactions between the viral S protein and

85

cell surface receptor, followed by fusion between the viral and host membrane. The

86

coronavirus S protein is functionally divided into two subunits, a cell attachment

87

subunit (S1) and a membrane-fusion subunit (S2). The S1 region contains an

88

N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD); both can be used for

89

coronavirus receptor binding (RBD) (20). For SARS-CoV, its S1-CTD serves as an

90

RBD for binding to the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

91

(21). Biochemical and crystal structure analyses have identified a few key residues in

92

the interface between the SARS-CoV S-RBD and human ACE2 (21-23).

93

SARSr-CoVs, detected in Rhinolophus sinicus, can be divided into two distinct

94

clades based on the size of the S protein. Clade 1 includes viruses that have S proteins

95

identical in size to the SARS-CoV S protein, whereas viruses belonging to clade 2

96

have a smaller S protein, due to 5, 12, or 13 amino acid deletions (17, 19). Despite the

97

variations in the RBD, all clade 1 strains can use ACE2 for cell entry, whereas clade 2

98

strains, with deletions cannot (14, 16, 17). These results suggest that members of

99

clade 1 are likely to be the direct source of SARS-CoV in terms of genome similarity

100

and ACE2 usage.

101

ACE2 is functionally divided into two domains—the N-terminal domain is

102

involved in SARS-CoV binding and the C-terminal domain in the regulation of heart

103

function (21, 24). Previous results have indicated that the C-terminal domains of

104

ACE2 from different origins are relatively well conserved, whereas the N-terminal

105

domains show much more diversity across species (25). Previously, we have shown

106

that SARS-CoV can utilize ACE2 derived from Myotis daubentonii and R. sinicus;

107

minor mutations in the RBD-binding site could convert ACE2 from being

108

unsusceptible to susceptible to SARS-CoV binding (26, 27). As all bat SARSr-CoV

109

belonging to clade 1 can utilize ACE2 and have been isolated from R. sinicus, we

110

asked whether variations in ACE2 of R. sinicus could contribute to the diversity of bat

111

SARSr-CoV.

112

Here, we have investigated the polymorphism of R. sinicus ACE2 genes and

113

assessed their susceptibility and binding affinity to different bat SARSr-CoV spike

114

proteins through a combination of molecular evolution analyses, protein affinity

115

assays, and virus infection assays. Our results showed that the diversity of the

116

SARSr-CoV spike protein may experience natural selection pressure from the R.

117

sinicus ACE2 variants; over long periods of co-existence, the SARSr-CoV spike

118

protein may be selected by R. sinicus ACE2 to maintain genetic diversity and to fit

119

with the population of R. sinicus.

respectively) and others (GenBank accession no. ACT66275; sample collected from

128

Hong Kong), we obtained ACE2 gene sequences from 21 R. sinicus bat individuals:

129

five from Hubei, nine from Guangdong, and seven from Yunnan. The ACE2

130

sequences exhibited 98–100% amino acid (aa) identity within their species and 80-81%

131

aa identity with human ACE2 (Table S1). Major variations were observed at the

132

N-terminal region, including in some residues which were previously identified to be

133

in contact with SARS-CoV S-RBD (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1). Analysis based on

134

nonsynonymous SNPs helped identify eight residues, including 24, 27, 31, 34, 35, 38,

135

41, and 42. The combination of these 8 residues produced eight alleles, including

136

RIESEDYK, LIEFENYQ, RTESENYQ, RIKSEDYQ, QIKSEDYQ, RMTSEDYQ,

137

EMKTKDHQ, and EIKTKDHQ, named allele 1–8, respectively (Fig. 1A). In

138

addition to the ACE2 genotype data from previous studies (allele 4, 7, and 8), five

139

novel alleles were identified in the R. sinicus populations in this study. Alleles 2 and 4

140

were found in two and three provinces, respectively, whereas the other alleles seemed

141

to be geographically restricted. In summary, three alleles (4, 6, and 8) were found in

142

Guangdong, four (1, 2, 4, and 7) in Yunnan, three (2, 4, and 5) in Hubei, and one each

143

in Guangxi and Hong Kong. Coexistence of four alleles was found in the same bat

144

cave of Yunnan where the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV was found (Fig. 1B). Taken

145

together, these data suggest that ACE2 variants have been circulating within the R.

146

sinicus populations in different regions for a long time; substitutions at the sites

147

directly in contact with SARS-CoV S-RBD suggest that they may have important

148

functions during SARS-CoV evolution and transmission.

To assess if different R. sinicus ACE2 molecules affect the entry of SARS-CoV and

168

bat SARSr-CoV, R. sinicus ACE2 variants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells

169

and the entry efficiency of SARS-CoV pseudotyped or bat SARSr-CoVs carrying

170

different S proteins were tested. The four tested bat SARSr-CoV strains can be

171

divided into four genotypes according to their S1 sequences, as reported previously

172

(17). Briefly, compared with SARS-CoV S protein, SARSr-CoV-RsWIV1 shares high

173

aa identity at the RBD; RsWIV16 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV and shows

174

high aa identity at both the NTD and RBD; Rs4231 shares high aa identity at the NTD;

175

and RsSHC014 shows divergence at both the NTD and RBD regions.

176

Similar to our previous report, all four bat SARSr-CoV strains with the same

177

genomic background but different S proteins could use human ACE2 and replicate at

178

similar levels (17). However, there are some differences in how they utilize R. sinicus

179

ACE2s (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2). All test viruses could efficiently use allele 1, 2, 4, 5 for

180

entry. RsWIV1 and RsWIV16, which share an identical RBD, could not use allele 6

181

(sample ID 1434) from Guangdong. Rs4231 and RsSHC014, which share an identical

182

RBD, could not use allele 7 (sample ID 3357) and 8 (sample ID 1438) from Yunnan

183

and Guangdong, respectively. SARS-CoV-BJ01, which shares high similarity with

184

WIV1 and WIV16 RBD, was able to use same bat ACE2 alleles as Rs4231 and

To further explain the different ability of SARS and SARSr-CoVs in ACE2 usage,

200

we expressed RBD from SARS-CoV BJ01, RsWIV1, and RsSHC014 and three R.

201

sinicus ACE2s, allele 6 (sample 1434), allele 7 (sample 3357), and allele 2 (sample

202

5720), and tested the binding affinity between them. BJ01 RBD with human ACE2

203

and RsWIV1 RBD with human DPP4 were used as the positive and negative control,

204

respectively. Real-time analysis showed that the binding affinity between different

205

RBDs and ACE2s was different based on the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD)

206

(Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). Consistent with the results of the virus infection experiments,

207

1434ACE2 (allele 6) was found to bind RsSHC014 and BJ01 but not RsWIV1 RBD;

208

3357ACE2 (allele 7) was found to bind RsWIV1 but not RsSHC014 and BJ01 RBD;

209

5720ACE2 (allele 2) was found to bind all tested RBDs. All tested RBDs had a high

210

binding affinity to human or bat ACE2. BJ01 RBD had a higher binding affinity for

211

human ACE2 than did RsWIV1 and RsSHC014 RBDs (Fig. 3A, E, and I); however,

212

it had a lower binding affinity to bat ACE2 than the two bat SARSr-CoV RBDs (Fig.

213

3B, D, F, G, J, K). These results demonstrated that the binding affinity between spike

214

RBD and ACE2 affects the ability of the virus to infect.

227

The four tested spike proteins of bat SARSr-CoV are identical in size and share

228

over 90% aa identity with SARS-CoV, which suggests that these proteins have a

229

similar structure. In this study, we built structural complex models of bat

230

SARSr-CoV-RsWIV1 RBD with R. sinicus ACE2 3357 (allele 7) and RsSHC014

231

RBD with R. sinicus ACE2 1434 (allele 6), in concordance with the results of the

232

binding affinity assay between SARS-CoV RBD and human ACE2 (Fig. 4).

233

Compared with the contact residues in the interface between SARS-CoV RBD and

234

human ACE2, changes in or near the two virus-binding hotspots on ACE2 (hotspots

235

Lys31 and Lys353 consist of a salt bridge with Glu35 and Asp38, respectively) were

236

observed. As reported previously, the two hot spots are buried in a hydrophobic

237

environment. They provide a substantial amount of energy to the virus-receptor

238

binding interactions as well as fill critical voids in the hydrophobic stacking

239

interactions at the binding interface (21, 29).

240

Compared with human ACE2 (Fig. 4A, C, D), R. sinicus ACE2-3357 contains

241

two main residue changes, E35K and Y41H. The E35K breaks the salt bridge with

242

K31 and Arg479 in RsSHC014 RBD, which may influence the binding affinity

243

between them. A histidine at position 41 may weaken the support for the K353–D38

244

salt bridge because it is a weaker hydrophobic stacker than tyrosine, resulting in

245

decreased binding affinity with BJ01 RBD (30). Consequently, BJ01 and RsSHC014

246

RBD showed a lower binding affinity with R. sinicus ACE2-3357.

247
248

In R. sinicus ACE2-1434, we found a threonine at 31, unlike human ACE2, which
has a lysine at this position (Fig. 4). Although the K31T change would fail to form a

249

salt bridge with Glu35, Tyr442 in BJ01 RBD can form a hydrogen bond with it (29).

250

However, a serine at 442 in RsWIV1 RBD cannot. Besides, RsSHC014 contains an

251

arginine at 479, and Thr31 cannot form a salt bridge with Glu35, making Glu35

252

available to form a salt bridge with Arg479, but the RBD residue Asn479 in RsWIV1

253

may lose this ability. Consequently, BJ01 and RsSHC014 RBD can bind with R.

In addition, all R. sinicus ACE2s in this study contain an asparagine at position

256

82 rather than a methionine in human ACE2. The M82N change introduces an

257

unfavorable hydrophilic residue which would weaken the hydrophobic network

258

around hot spot 31. Moreover, Asn82 introduces a glycosylation site, like that in rat

259

ACE2, which cannot support SARS-CoV infection efficiently; the glycan at position

260

82 of ACE2 may lead to steric interference with viral RBD binding. Hence, M82N

261

may have significant effects on the interaction between SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV

262

RBD with R. sinicus ACE2s. As previously described, residue 487 of the RBD

263

interacts with hot spot 353 on ACE2. RsWIV1 contains an Asn487 in its RBD, the

264

polar side chain of Asn487 may have unfavorable interactions with the aliphatic

265

portion of residue Lys353 in ACE2, which may affect the hot spot interaction between

266

K353 and D38. Moreover, the RsSHC014 RBD contains an alanine at position 487;

267

the small side chain of Ala 487 does not provide support to the structure of hot spot

268

353 (19). Therefore, both RsWIV1 and RsSHC014 RBD had a lower binding affinity

269

to human ACE2 than did BJ01, but they both showed a higher binding affinity with

SARSr-CoV spike genes have coevolved with R. sinicus ACE2 through positive

290

selection

291

To test the possible selection pressure acting on the SARSr-CoV spike and R.

292

sinicus ACE2 gene, we used the codeml program of the PAML software package (31)

293

to analyze the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations (dN/dS ratios) at

294

individual codons. We analyzed the complete gene encoding the SARSr-CoV spike

295

protein by aligning nine SARSr-CoV spike gene sequences from R. sinicus samples.

296

We found that the models allowed codons to evolve under positive selection (M2a and

297

M8). In model M8 (initial seed value for ω (dN/dS) = 1.6, codon frequency = F3X4),

298

20 codons (p>0.95) were under positive selection with dN/dS>1 (Table 1), 17 of

299

those were found to be located on the RBD region, which faces its receptor ACE2,

300

according to the crystal structure (Fig. S5). Moreover, five of those (442, 472, 479,

301

480, and 487), present in the SARS-CoV spike, have been previously identified to

302

have a significant impact on binding affinity to human ACE2 (Fig. 4, Table S3 and

303

Fig. S5) (32). We next analyzed the ACE2 gene of R. sinicus by aligning 25 R. sinicus

304

ACE2 gene sequences obtained in this study and downloaded from GenBank. We

305

found that 12 codons (2.3%, p>0.95) were under positive selection with dN/dS>1 in

306

model M8 (Table 1), and 8 of them (24, 27, 31, 34, 35, 38, 41, and 42) correspond to

307

the residues in human ACE2, which were previously identified to be involved in

direct contact with the human SARS-CoV spike protein (Fig. 4, Fig. S5) (32). We also

309

analyzed the ACE2 gene of Rhinolophus affinis (R. affinis), which has been reported

310

to carry SARSr-CoV occasionally (15). Used an alignment of 23 ACE2 gene

311

sequences from R. affinis obtained in this study, we found that R. affinis ACE2 was

312

more conserved between different individuals in the entire coding region than R.

313

sinicus ACE2 (Fig. S6) and no obvious positive selection sites were observed (data

314

not shown). Additionally, by querying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)

315

databases, we found that SNPs in human ACE2 gene arose randomly through the

316

entire coding region (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/). Although we identified two

317

SNP sites with nonsynonymous mutation (T27A and E35K) in human ACE2, both

318

displayed a rare frequency in the global population (frequency 0.00001 and 0.00002,

319

respectively). These results indicate that positive selection has happened at the

320

interface between bat SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2.

Discussion

337

Chinese horseshoe bats are widely distributed in China and carry genetically diverse

338

SARSr-CoVs. Two different clades of bat SARSr-CoVs were discovered, based on the

339

size and similarity of S protein to that of human SARS-CoV. SARSr-CoVs of clade-1,

340

only found in Yunnan province, have an S protein identical in size to SARS-CoV and

341

use the ACE2 receptor, whereas SARSr-CoVs of clade-2 are widely distributed in

342

China and cannot use ACE2 as the receptor (19). In this study, we analyzed ACE2

343

sequences of R. sinicus, collected from four provinces and one city, and observed

344

highly polymorphic sites, which correspond to those that interact with SARS-CoV

345

RBD, at the N-terminal region. Despite these variations, most ACE2s supported the

346

viral entry of clade-1 bat SARSr-CoVs, but with different susceptibilities and binding

347

affinities. In addition, we have identified key residues involved in the interaction

348

between the bat ACE2 variants and SARSr-CoV RBD by structural modeling and

349

positive selection analysis. These results indicate that SARSr-CoV has co-evolved

350

with its natural host, R. sinicus, for a very long time. Members of clade-1 use ACE2

351

as the receptor, whereas members of clade-2 exploit different receptor(s), due to the

352

deletions in S protein.

353

Genes with important functions usually display a dN/dS ratio of less than 1

354

(negative selection) because most amino acid alterations in a protein are deleterious.

355

In a host-virus arms race situation, the genes involved tend to display dN/dS ratios

356

greater than 1 (positive selection), specifically in the codons involved in the

357

interaction interface between the virus and its host, with minimal effect on their

358

physical function (20, 33). In this study, our analysis of the SARSr-CoV spike protein

359

and R. sinicus ACE2 gene sequences showed that some codons related to the

360

interaction interface between them were under positive selection. Similar rapid

361

adaptation for SARS-CoV occurred during the SARS outbreak in 2002–2003 (21, 34).

362

When SARS-CoV was transmitted from market civet to human, the spike gene

363

experienced positive selection, where mutations in two critical residues (amino acids

364

479 and 487) of the spike protein changed the binding affinity of the virus to human

365

ACE2 from low to high; subsequently, turning into a pandemic strain (34).

366

An increasing number of studies have suggested that co-evolution is driven by

367

specific interactions between high levels of virus sequence divergence and

368

polymorphic host receptors (20, 33, 35-38). The first example was observed for the

369

avian leucosis virus infection in which receptor polymorphism in chicken could alter

370

the sensitivity to virus entry (36). Arms race can also occur between the glycoproteins

371

of two different viruses, as seen for the rodent arenavirus and the mouse mammary

372

tumor virus, with their receptor transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) (39).

373

In a continuous coevolutionary process, viruses often tend to decrease their

374

virulence to fit both the host and the virus population. The “trade-off hypothesis” is

375

the most popular explanation for why pathogens often do not reach their maximum

376

reproductive potential (40, 41). In this study, we have found that bat SARSr-CoV

377

RBDs showed a lower binding affinity to R. sinicus ACE2 than to human ACE2, but

378

did not display obvious differences among the R. sinicus ACE2s, indicating that bat

379

SARSr-CoVs may decrease their virulence to fit both the host and themselves. When

380

they adapt to fit other host receptors better, cross-species transmission events could

381

happen. This situation can be demonstrated by the higher binding affinity seen

382

between SARS-CoV-BJ01 RBDs and human ACE2s than bat SARSr-CoV strains in

383

this study. Similar examples can be found in other cases of coevolution between host

384

receptor and virus (36, 39, 42, 43). Previous studies have shown adaptive evolution of

385

the coronavirus spike protein to host receptor in vivo and in vitro (44-48). Recently,

386

the MERS-CoV spike protein was shown to rapidly adapt to Desmodus rotundus

387

DPP4 (drDPP4) receptor from semi-permissive to permissive state after several

388

passages in vitro. Furthermore, mutations detected in the RBD of MERS-CoV spike

389

protein enhanced viral entry and replication on cells expressing drDPP4 within three

390

passages (49). Similarly, adaptive mutations have occurred in the Ebola virus

391

envelope protein, which contacts its receptor, NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter

392

1, when it crossed the host-virus barriers, was transmitted to different hosts, and

393

entered the human population (50-53). These examples are a warning that the

394

SARSr-CoVs circulating in R. sinicus may adapt to other animal hosts, including

395

humans, and cause the next SARS-like disease. Therefore, it is important to

396

continually monitor SARSr-CoVs in R. sinicus populations to avoid future spillover

397

events. Our study provides an example to assess the risk of a potential spillover from

398

viruses circulating in animal populations through the positive selection analysis,

399

structural modeling, and experimental verification.

55). ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase and its role as the SARS-CoV receptor

403

does not affect its peptidase activity. Moreover, the structural complex shows that the

404

SARS-CoV spike RBD does not block the catalytically-active site of ACE2 (21, 56).

405

Considering the conserved recognition site in receptor of SARSr-CoV clade 1, the

406

interface of SARS-CoV and ACE2 interaction would be an ideal target for drug

Bat ACE2 gene was amplified using DNA from the intestinal tissue of bats. In brief,

426

total RNA was extracted from bat intestine tissue using the RNAprep pure Kit (for

427

Cell/Bacteria) (TIANGEN, Beijing, China). First-strand complementary DNA was

428

synthesized from total RNA by reverse transcription with random hexamers;

429

full-length bat ACE2 fragments were amplified by reverse-transcription nested

430

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Primers were designed based on available

ACE2 sequences from NCBI. First-round primers are as follows:

using rabbit serum against the SARSr-CoV-Rp3 NP, as previously described (14), and

470

Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam, Cambridge Biomedical Campus,

471

Cambridge, UK). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Staining

472

patterns were examined using a fluorescence imaging system (EVOS™ FL Color

473

474
475

Real-time PCR

476

SARSr-CoV infection was detected by RT-PCR, as described previously (14). In brief,

477

HeLa cells were transfected with equal amounts of human or R. sinicus ACE2

478

plasmids, 24 h before they were infected with the virus, at an MOI = 0.01 with 1 h

479

adsorption. Thereafter, the cells were washed with D-Hanks solution three times and

480

cultured in 1 mL DMEM+2% FBS. The viral supernatants were harvested at 0, 12, 24,

481

and 48 h post-infection—200 μL supernatant was removed and an equal amount of

482

medium was added back at each time point. Viral RNA was extracted from the

483

supernatant using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Waltham, MA, USA) and then

484

quantified on the ABI Step One system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,

485

USA), with the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems life

486

technologies, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA dilutions from purified

487

SARSr-CoV-RsWIV1 stock were used as a standard (with a titer of 6.5 × 106

488

PFU/mL). Every sample was analyzed in triplicate on two independent occasions.

491

Binding assays between SARS/SARSr-CoV RBD and human or R. sinicus ACE2

492

protein were performed using the Octet RED system (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA,

493

USA) in 96-well microplates at 30°C, as described previously (59, 60). Briefly, the

494

RBD was biotinylated using EZ-Link NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific,

495

Waltham, MA, USA). The assay was carried out by placing the Streptavidin

496

Biosensors (ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) in the wells and measuring changes in

497

layer thickness (nm) over time (s). First, the sensors were rinsed in the kinetic buffer

498

(1 M NaCl, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20; pH 6.5) for 120 s, which served as the

499

baseline. Thereafter, the sensors were immobilized for 600 s, with 200 μL buffer

500

containing biotinylated SARSr-CoV RBD (50 μg/mL). Subsequently, the sensors

501

were washed in the kinetic buffer for 200 s. Finally, the sensors were exposed to a

502

series of diluted ACE2 protein run in 200 μL volumes. The association between each

503

RBD and its corresponding ACE2 binding partner was monitored for 900 s. This was

504

followed by monitoring their dissociation in the kinetic buffer for 900 s. During the

505

entire experiment, the sample plate was kept shaking at 1000 rpm, and an

506

RBD-loaded biosensor was used in association with the buffer as a baseline. Data

507

analysis from the ForteBio Octet RED instrument includes reference subtraction.

508

Inter-step correction and Y-alignment were used to minimize tip-dependent variability.

509

Data were globally fitted in a 1:1 model using the Data Analysis Software v7.1

510

(ForteBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA).

513

SARS-CoV-BJ01 pseudotyped particles were produced by HEK 293T/17 cells.

514

Plasmids, pcDNA3.1-BJ01-S and pNL4-3.luc.R-E-, were co-transfected into HEK

515

293T/17 cells. At 6 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh 293T

516

FreeStyle expression medium. The supernatant, which contained the pseudotyped

517

particles, was harvested 48 h post-transfection and filtered using 0.45 μm filters.

518

Thereafter, the pseudotyped particles were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until further

519

use. The viral titer was determined by the HIV p24 Quantitation ELISA Kits (Kyab

520

Biotech Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China) before the viruses were used for the infection assay.

521

HeLa cells were transfected with the same amount of human or R. sinicus ACE2

522

plasmids. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with SARS-CoV-BJ01 pseudotyped at

523

an MOI = 1 or 0.1 for 1 h at 37°C, washed twice with D-Hanks solution, and

524

supplemented with DMEM containing 10% FBS. Luciferase activity was determined

525

using a GloMax luminometer (Promega Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) 48 h after

526

infection. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate on two independent occasions.

Structure modeling

529

The structure complex of SARS-CoV/SARSr-CoVs RBD and R. sinicus ACE2 was

530

homology modeled using SWISS-MODEL (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), based on

531

the structure of human SARS-CoV RBD (hTor2 RBD) complexed with human ACE2

532

(hACE2) and civet-optimized RBD complexed with hACE2 (Protein Data Bank ID:

533

2AJF, 3SCJ) (29). Molecular graphics visualization and analyses were performed

534

using the UCSF Chimera software (http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera).

Codon-based analysis of molecular evolution

537

Bat ACE2 and SARSr-CoV spike sequences were analyzed for positive selection. In

538

this study, bat ACE2 sequences were either amplified or downloaded from NCBI and

539

SARSr-CoV spike sequences were downloaded from NCBI; the database accession

540

numbers are listed in Table S2. Sequences were aligned in Clustal X. Phylogenetic

541

trees were built by the maximum likelihood method implemented in RAxML program

542

in CIPRES Science Gateway (https://www.phylo.org/). Maximum likelihood analysis

543

of dN/dS was performed using the codeml program in the PAML4.7 software package,

544

as previously described (31, 39). In brief, multiple alignments were fit to NSsites

545

models M1a, M2a, M7, M8a, and M8. Model fitting was performed with multiple

546

seed values for dN/dS and assuming either the F61 or F3x4 model of codon

547

frequencies. We used likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) to assess a better fit of codons that

548

allowed positive selection. Posterior probabilities of codons under positive selection

549

in different models were inferred using the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) algorithm.

Accession numbers

552

The complete ACE2 sequences of R. sinicus and R. affinis ACE2 obtained in this
