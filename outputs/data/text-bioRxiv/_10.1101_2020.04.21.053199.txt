Abstract
Novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), also known as SARS-CoV-2), leads high morbidity and mortality in global
epidemics. Four structural proteins (surface glycoprotein (QIQ22760.1), envelop glycoprotein (QIQ22762.1),
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (QIQ22768.1) and membrane glycoprotein (QIQ22763.1)) of SARS-CoV-2 are extracted
from the NCBI database and further analyzed with ExPASy ProtParam tool. Lucien is the highest in envelope, surface
and membrane glycoprotein that is an optimal environment for rapid virus fixation on host cell's surface to the receptor
molecule. Transmembrane region prediction was performed by SOSUI server. For all structural proteins, except
nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein, the trans-membrane prediction indicates that the virus can enter the host easily. Domain
analysis was done by SMART tool. Domain information helps in the function of the viral protein. Lastly, the 3D
structure prediction was carried out by Swiss Model and the result validation was achieved by PROCHECK. Such
models are the starting point of the community for structural drug and vaccine designs as well as virtual computational
screening.

I. INTRODUCTION
The latest 2019–nCoV, now officially known as Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), was established as the responsible pandemic.
Infections of (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported in
more than 200 countries including Pakistan [1]. The
first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to be published
from Pakistan and is now available on NCBI
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT240479,
GISAID and NEXTRAIN.
Coronaviruses, a genus belonging to the Coronaviridae
family, contain the largest genome (26.4 kb to 31.7 kb)
of RNA viruses with a diameter of 120–160 nm,
consisting of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA
molecule [2] The broad genome has given this family of
viruses extra plasticity in their adaptation and alteration
of genes. The G + C content of coronavirus genomes
ranges from 32% TO 43% The genome consists of
seven genes arranged in sequence [5′- replicase
ORF1ab, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M),
nucleocapside (N)-3′] with small untranslated regions in
both termini and additional ORFs in each subgroup of
coronavirus. [3, 4]
5 'Non-structural protein coding regions consisting of
two-thirds genome replicase genes 1 and structural and
non-essential gene. 2-7 regions consisting of structural
and non-essential protein coding regions [5]. The genes

are translated from genomic mRNA 2 -7. Subgenomic
RNAs encode the main Surface Proteins (S), Envelope
Protein (E), Membranes Protein (M), and
Nucleocapside Protein [6].
Surface protein of SARS CoV-2 join ACE2
(angiotensin- converting enzyme2) and to infect cells.
After this initial process, Surface Protein must be
produced with an enzyme known as protease to
complete entry into the cell. SARS CoV-2 uses
TMPRSS 2 in the same way as SARS-CoV is used to
complete this process [8]
Surface Glycoproteins are outside of the virion and give
the typical shape to the virion. The S proteins form
homotrimers that allow sun-like morphologies to be
developed that give the name Coronaviruses via the Cterminal transmembrane regions, S proteins bind to the
virion membrane and interact with M proteins. Virions
can be attached through the N-terminus of the S
proteins to different surface receptors in the host cell's
plasma membrane. The S protein is the receptor-binder
and viral input in host cells and is therefore a major
therapeutic objective [9].
Membrane Glycoproteins proteins inside the Golgi
system are glycosylated. The modification of the M
protein is essential for the virion to attach into the cell
and make antigenic protein [10].
The protein M plays a key role in the cell's regeneration
of virions. N protein forms a complex by binding to

genomic RNA and M protein activates the development
of interacting virions in this intermediate endoplasmic
reticulum-Golgi interface (ERGIC) compartment with
this complex [11,12].
Envelop Glycoproteins are tiny proteins consisting of
around 76 to 109 amino acids. Approximately 30 amino
acids in the E protein N-terminus allow attachment to
the virus membrane [13].
Additionally, coronavirus E proteins play a critical role
in virion assembly and morphogenesis within the cell.
For one research coronavirus E and M proteins were
expressed for conjunction with vectors of mammalian
expression to form virus-like structures inside the cell
[14, 15].
In another review, the ability of recombinant mouse
hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS viruses to generate E
protein expression in the genome to sustain this status
has been significantly reduced [16, 17].
N Proteins are helix-capable phosphoproteins with a
versatile viral genomic RNA structure. It plays an
important role in coronavirus virion assembly,
replication and transcription, as the N protein locates
both the coronavirus replication / transcription region
and the ERGIC region where the virus is collected [18].
In this paper, we tried to describe the four structural
proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by the use of bioinformatics
tools
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Four structural proteins of SARS COV-2 included in
this research named as surface glycoprotein
(QIQ22760.1), envelop glycoprotein (QIQ22762.1),
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (QIQ22768.1), membrane
glycoprotein (QIQ22763.1) available in the NCBI was
retrieved. For further study of bioinformatics, the
FASTA sequence was selected and used.
Protein statistics
Using the Protparam method, protein statistics were
reviewed. ProtParam method enables the measurement
of various physicochemical protein sequence
parameters. Parameters included molecular weight,
Theoretical Pi (Isoelectric
point), Half-life
calculation, instability index, aliphatic index and Grand
range of hydropathicity (GRAVY)
Trans-membrane sequence prediction
SOSUI tools from EXPASY repository are used for
predicting transmembrane. Results normally return
within 1 min. It provides the following production
number of TMHs with sequence and protein type
Functional Site Prediction
One of the main goals of molecular biology is
functional assignment to protein. Protein functional
sites that are responsible for or perform all of the
essential protein functions are more conserved than
other regions over the time of evolution. These
accessible websites are called domains. SMART
Internet server was forecasting domains

3D Model predictions and validation

The SARS COV-2 structural protein amino acid
sequences are used as targets for homology modeling
using the SWISS-MODEL server. Depending on the
Global Model Quality Estimation (GMQE) and
QMEAN, the top-ranked models are further analyzed
and sorted. GMQE is a quality estimate that combines
the target – template alignment properties with the
template search method. The corresponding GMQE
value is given as 0 to 1. The QMEAN Z-score gives a
global estimation of the "degree of nativeness" of the
structural characteristics observed in the model and is
described in Benkert et al. [19] QMEAN Z-scores
about zero indicate strong compatibility between the
structure of the model and similar-size experimental
structures. Scores of -4.0 or below are indicative of
poor quality models. The overall stereochemical
output was checked by PROCHECK including
torsional angles to the backbone through the
Ramachandran plot [20]
III. RESULTS
Protein Statistics
Phenyl alanine and serine are absolutely missing in all
proteins tested as displayed in chemical parameters
(Table 1). Histidine and glutamic acid is absent in
envelope protein and cystein lacks in nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein. lucien quantity is more in envelop
protein, surface and membrane glycoprotein while
glycine is more in nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
The physical parameters (Table 2) show that Surface
protein contain highest amino acids (1273), negatively
charged residues (110) positively charged residues
(103), EC (148960) and molecular weight (141178.47).
Higher molecular weight of the surface glycoprotein
suggests that its tertiary structure may contain strong
amino acid side chains. All three Proteins are basic in
nature, excluding surface glycoprotein, as the isoelectric
point value is more than 9.The instability index value
greater than 40 is considered unstable [21]This is
derived from the Instability index surface, membrane
and envelop glycoprotein is stable and nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein is highly unstable .the range of aliphatic
index from 33.01 -55.09 that suggests a tendency to be
sensitive to a wide range of temperatures[22] and
GRAVY value shows protein's hydropathicity and
whether the nature protein side chains are hydrophilic
or hydrophobic [23].Leaving the surface Glycoprotein
and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein all other protein are
hydrophobic in nature
Trans-membrane sequence prediction
Analysis of the transmembrane protein reveals (Table
3) that it is absent in nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The
other three proteins show transmembrane sequence. All
three other proteins show different sequence from each
other.
Membrane
glycoprotein
have
three
transmembrane region yet there is a sequence of length
22 and 23 amino acids in all the proteins that show
trans-membrane. All the proteins have different C and
N terminals

3D Model predictions and validation
3D Model predictions and validation
(Table 5 and Figure. 2) shows the evaluation of the 3D
model that all four proteins have satisfactory model
with QMEAN > 0.Model validity research Shows that
the models are at the optimum point, just like in the
Ramchandran series.
(Figure 3).
The SWISS-MODEL system was used for protein
structure homology modelling and alignments for all
structural proteins of SARS COV 2. First, the right
protein template structures in PDB were selected using
the given measures: should high reporting of the
template (i.e. > 60% target associated with the template)
and sequence uniqueness > 35%. Instead, as an initial
criterion, we used the GMQE and QMEAN4 scoring
method to distinguish well from poor ones
We also carried out PROCHECK analysis to measures
protein structure stereochemical consistency by
comparing geometry with residue-by-residue and
particularly structural geometry.

There should be more than 90 % amino acid for good
quality model according to the PROCHECK standard
acid resided in the most favored regions. Table
5 and Figure 4 indicate that percentage of modeled
proteins residues in most favoured regions (red) is
83%─91.4%, percentage of residues of the modeled
proteins in additional allowed regions (yellow) is
8.6─15.6% , percentage of residues of the modeled
proteins in generously allowed regions (beige) is
0.0─1.5%, and percentage of residues in disallowed
regions (white) is 0.0%
These findings show that the models are generated
overall stereochemical properties were highly stable,
and that future molecular modelling studies can benefit
from the models. Of those four proteins, the
Ramachandran plots provide more proof of their
acceptability (Figure 3).

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The physical parameters shows that Surface protein
contain highest
amino acids, negatively charged
residues, positively charged residues, EC
and
molecular weight than other proteins. The chemical
factors show in proteins phenyl alanine and serine is
totally absent in all structural proteins, there is a lack of
histidine and glutamic acid in the protein envelope and
a lack of cysteine in the nucleocapside phosphoprotein.
The envelope, surface and membrane glycoprotein is
rich in Leucine so have more affinity to the host cell
receptor surface as stated in Luo et al, 1999. Although
glycine is more in nucleocapside phosphoprotein,
researchers should be able to isolate the protein with
little effort along with these data and iso-electric point
value. Higher molecular weight of the surface
glycoprotein suggests that its tertiary structure
may contain strong amino acid side chains.
Instability index surface, membrane and envelop
glycoprotein
is
stable
and
nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein is highly unstable Leaving the
surface
Glycoprotein
and
nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein all other protein are hydrophobic
in nature. The prediction of trans-membrane in all
structural proteins except Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein
shows the virus ability to reach the host with ease. This
fairly simple method may help us understand how
antivirals and vaccines could be produced against it
Furthermore, as a beginning for docking studies (small
and large scale) we are now offering homology models,
Diverse knowledge of the molecular biology of SARS
COV_2 is required to learn more.

Developing technologies will gain valuable insight into
the structure of the protein in order to determine how
protein disease induces, and understanding the
relationship between protein-protein and protein
RNA would greatly enhance our ability to develop
vaccines. Meanwhile, methods of molecular simulation
provide important solutions to the struggle
