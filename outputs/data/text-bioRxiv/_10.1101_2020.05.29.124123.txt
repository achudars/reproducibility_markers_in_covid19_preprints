Abstract
The pandemic SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has created a
widespread panic across the globe especially in the developing countries like Pakistan. The
lack of resources and technical staff are causing havoc challenges in the detection and
prevention of this global outbreak. Therefore, a less expensive and massive screening of
suspected individuals for COVID-19 is required. In this study, a user-friendly technique of
reverse transcription- loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was designed and
validated to suggest a potential RT-qPCR alternate for rapid testing of COVID-19 suspected
individuals. A total of 12 COVID-19 negative and 72 COVID-19 suspected individuals were
analyzed. Both RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assays were performed for all the individuals using
open reading frame (ORF 1ab), nucleoprotein (N) and Spike (S) genes. All 12 specimens
which were negative using RT-qPCR were also found negative using RT-LAMP assay.
Overall 62 out of 72 positive samples (detected using RT-qPCR) were found COVID-19
positive using RT-LAMP assay. Interestingly all samples (45) having Ct values less than 30
showed 100% sensitivity. However, samples with weaker Ct values (i.e., => 35) showed 54%
concordance, suggesting potential false negatives or false positives in RT-LAMP or RTqPCR results, respectively.
Overall comparative assessment showed that RT-LAMP assay showed strong sensitivity and
specificity and can be used as an alternative strategy for rapid COVID-19 testing. Hence,
based on fast processing time, minimal risk of specimens transfer and utilizing available
resources, LAMP based detection of COVID-19 is strongly advocated especially for
developing countries.

Introduction
Global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is
creating a havoc challenge especially in developing countries like Pakistan1,2. Being 5th
populated country, sharing borders with two adversely affected countries (Iran and China), a
massive screening of suspected individuals for COVID-19 is required3. Based on variable
clinical symptoms ranging from mild flu to life threatening shortage of breath signs it is
pertinent to establish an efficient diagnostics tool for earliest detection SARS-CoV-2. So far
all commercially COVID-19 tests are relying on two strategies. In the first strategy, variety of
immunological assays are developed responsible for detection of antibodies produced by
individuals as a result of current or past exposure to the virus4. The second strategy focusses
on SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA detection using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 5. Additionally,
loop mediated isothermal amplification-based techniques are in process 6. All these strategies
have preferential advantages depending upon the objectives of the screening. As immune
assays help to identify individuals retaining developed antibodies against virus and could be
potential convalescent plasma donors. Genome based testing facilities help in diagnosis of
SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.
As per National Command and Operation Control (https://ncoc.gov.pk/), there are 94
laboratories offering detection of COVID-19 in Pakistan. All these labs are using real time
PCR techniques (RT-qPCR) for detection of SAR-Cov-19. Despite of technique’s robustness,
challenges related to increasing number of affected cases in both urban and rural areas, direly
require fast and less expensive alternate techniques. Since installation of expensive
instrument, prolong reaction time (~3hr), cost of reagents and trained staff availability in an
emerging outbreak (COVID-19) are debilitating its effective utilization across Pakistan.
Here, an alternate user-friendly technique of reverse transcription- loop mediated isothermal
amplification (RT-LAMP) was designed and validated against COVID-19. Earlier, LAMP

assay was used for detection of Hepatitis B virus (HBV)7. Briefly, Bacillus
stearothermophilus (Bst polymerase) along with set of 4 primers (2 inner and 2 outer
primers) were used in the assay. Reaction began with the binding of the inner primers
containing sequences of sense and anti-sense strands of DNA. Here, Bst DNA polymerase

→3’ exonuclease activity for 1 hr at 65°C.

Addition of reverse transcriptase along with Bst polymerase in LAMP assay can also enhance
its utilization for rapid detection of RNA based viruses. In light of these modifications,
LAMP technology was efficiently been advocated by World Health Organisation (WHO)
under ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, Userfriendly, Rapid and Robust,
Equipment free, Deliverable to end users) criteria 8.

Methodology
Cohort Identification
National Institute of Health (NIH) is a core national referral resource Institute responsible for
accreditation and testing of COVID-19 screening facilities. For the present study, 72 COVID19 suspected individuals were enrolled at NIH. These individuals were categorized into
different groups based on the Ct values retrieved from RT-qPCR.
Specimen Collection and RNA Isolation
Nasopharyngeal specimens from these individuals were collected at designated specimen
collection facility. After immersing these specimens in virus transfer buffer, these tubes were
processed further for RNA isolation using commercially available kit. TANBead Nucleic
Acid Kit was used for viral RNA isolation by using TANBead Nucleic Acid Extractor (model
SLA-16/32) as per manufacturer instructions. Briefly, this kit used silicon dioxide layer
coated magnetic beads for isolation of nucleic acid in 40 min.
Designing of RT-LAMP assay Primer
Primers targeting open reading frame (ORF 1ab), nucleoprotein (N) and Spike (S) genes were
designed using Primer Explorer V5 software. As per guidelines of LAMP assay, these panel
of primers were specifically designed against a predefined genomic region of 2019-nCoV
(genome Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2).

Primer sequences will be provided on

request.
Reaction Conditions for RT-LAMP Assay
WarmStart Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) vials were used for
RT-LAMP assay. Three separate primer mix for each gene were prepared as working stock
vials for the reaction. Reaction tube for each specimen containing 2x master mix (12.5 µl),
10X primer mix (1X; 2.5 µl), RNA (2 µl) and water (8 µl) were left at thermomixer®

(Eppendorf) for incubation. Efforts were made to set forth best optimum temperature ranging
from 62C° -65C° with time ranging from 45 min- 75min for better yield.
Estimation of assay Sensitivity and Specificity
Being a colorimetric LAMP assay, change in color of reaction mix from pink to yellow color
was set as indicator of presence of virus. Since generation of concatemers result in lowering
of pH from basic to acidic state. Hence, both amplification and detection of respective
concatemers were completed in a single step. In addition, samples were also validated using
gel electrophoresis results.
QPCR based Detection of COVID-19 for Respective Specimens
All aforementioned specimens (72) were analyzed using available COVID-19 diagnostic
kits. RNA sample of these respective specimens were processed for diagnosis using RTqPCR kit as per manufacturer instructions. Hence RT-LAMP findings were also cross
checked with available gold standard testing facility of RT-qPCR.

Results
Identification of COVID-19 in the cohort
Majority of these individuals were male expatriate Pakistani returning home with median age
of 38Yrs. All 12 specimens which were negative using RT-qPCR were also found negative
using RT-LAMP assay.
Detection of RT LAMP based COVID-19
Overall 62 out of 72 positive samples (detected using RT-qPCR) were found COVID-19
positive using RT-LAMP assay. After extensive optimization, RT-LAMP reaction optimum
conditions for all three genes were set at 65C° for 1hr duration. COVID-19 positive samples
showed pronounced change in coloration from pink to yellow color against all three
respective genes (Figure 1).
Comparative assessment of qPCR and RT-LAMP based COVID-19 detection
Next, we divided positive samples into different RT-qPCR groups based on their Ct values.
Interestingly all samples (45) having Ct values less than 30 showed 100% sensitivity (Figure
2). 10 out 14 samples with Ct values < 35 showed positivity using RT-LAMP assay.
However, 7 out of 13 samples with Ct values => 35 showed positivity using RT-LAMP
assay. This suggests that samples with Ct > 35 should be re-evaluated for potential false
positivity of RT- RT-qPCR (Figure 2).

Discussions
Overall comparative assessment showed that RT-LAMP assay showed strong sensitivity and
specificity and can be used as alternate strategy for rapid COVID-19 testing. Earlier, LAMP
assay been widely used for screening of food pathogens 9, detection of avian influenza virus
10

and gastric cancer metastasis

. Interestingly, several modifications towards earliest

identification of concatemers also improve and largely reduced assay dependency on
expensive instruments. Conventionally, LAMP products could also be detected by using
agarose gel electrophoreses after 1hr incubation at high temperature 7. Later on, formation of
white precipitate (magnesium pyrophosphate) in the reaction tube may also traced either by
naked eye or spectrophotometry12. Pyrophosphate binding with a divalent metallic ion
magnesium ion (Mg++) was the principle underlying the development of turbidity where
increase turbidity was directly correlated with DNA synthesized. Alternatively, introduction
of calcein (fluorexan) also acting as fluorescent metal indicator was used to enhance visual
detection of LAMP reaction.
In the beginning of reaction, binding affinity of manganous ion (Mn2+) was responsible for
quenching of calcein signals. During amplification of targeted reaction, generated
pyrophosphate forming complex with Mn2+ , facilitate calcein release resulting in
fluorescence detected under UV

13

. Similarly, ethidium bromide and Malachite Green dyes

have also been used as detection for the LAMP amplification products

14

. In Warmstart

mastermix, pH based approach was used where release of pyrophosphate result in lowering
of pH from pink to yellow. This colorimetric assay is potentially the easiest approach where
we can have reduced assay dependency on expensive instruments as well as highly trained
technicians.
Currently, few LAMP based kits like ID NOW COVID-19 and iAMP COVID-19 also
approved by FDA are commercially available for SARS-Cov-2 detection. ID NOW COVID-

19 (Abbott Diagnostics) target isothermal amplification of a single gene (RdRP) with fast
processing time (~13min). However, it can process one sample per run with close
dependency on reagents and consumables as per manufacturer instructions. iAMP COVID-19
(Atila BioSystems) target isothermal amplification of ORF1ab and N genes with processing
time of 1.5hrs. Based on global disease burden, availability of these kits at Pakistan would be
extremely challenging especially when export of certain kits are barred from country of
origin (like Loopamp 2019-nCOV Detection Kit of Eiken export from Japan). In the current
study, detection of SARS-Cov-2 utilizing 3 genes (ORF1ab, N and S) genes immensely
improved LAMP test detection threshold and reliability on inhouse resources. Hence, based
on fast processing time, minimal risk of specimens transfer and utilizing available resources,
LAMP based detection of COVID-19 is strongly advocated for developing countries.
