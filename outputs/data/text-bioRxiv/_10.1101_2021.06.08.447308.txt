Abstract:
There is an ongoing global effort, to design, manufacture, and clinically assess vaccines against

SARS-CoV-2. Over the course of the ongoing pandemic a number of new SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates
or variants of concern (VoC) have been identified containing mutations that negatively impact the
role of neutralising antibodies. In this study we describe the generation and preclinical assessment
of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine against the variant of concern B.1.351 (AZD2816). We
demonstrate AZD2816 is immunogenic after a single dose and when used as a booster dose in
animals primed with original vaccine AZD1222, we see no evidence of original antigenic sin but
high titre antibodies against a number of variant spike proteins. In addition, neutralisation titres
against B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta), are induced in these boost
regimens. These data support the ongoing clinical development and testing of this new variant
vaccine.

Introduction:
Since the first reports of infections caused by a novel coronavirus, there has been an
unprecedented global effort to design, manufacture and test multiple vaccines against SARS-CoV2. All authorised vaccines, to date, target the full-length spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and induce
neutralising antibodies to varying levels. COVID-19 vaccines are being deployed world-wide and

effectiveness data is now demonstrating the impact vaccination has on preventing COVID related
hospital admissions and death 1-3.
Over the course of the pandemic a number of variants of concern (VoC) have been identified, each
containing multiple mutations within the viral genome. Variants with mutations in the spike
protein and in particular the receptor binding domain (RBD), which facilitates viral cell entry via
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, are of most concern. There is the potential
for VoC to escape vaccine-induced host immunity due to the reduced ability of neutralising
antibodies to bind and prevent cell entry of the VoC, resulting in infection and disease even in
vaccinated individuals.
The B.1.351 variant (Beta)4, first identified in October 2020, contains 10 changes across the spike
protein with 3 amino acid changes in the RBD region. These changes in RBD are reported to
increase binding between spike and ACE2, leading to overall reduced ability of antibodies induced
against the original virus to block cell entry 5. Efforts are underway to produce second generation
SARS CoV-2 vaccines targeting VoC.
In this study we describe the generation and preclinical assessment of ChAdOx1 expressing
B.1.351 spike protein; AZD2816. Importantly both binding and neutralising antibodies against
B.1.351 are measured after single dose vaccination. When AZD2816 is used as a booster dose in
mice already primed with the original ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) we measure strong antibody
binding against both the original wild-type and B.1.351 spike protein, with booster doses
increasing the antibody response and neutralising ability against other variants. These data
support the clinical testing of AZD2816 either alone or in prime-boost regimens with heterologous
spike proteins.

Results:
Single dose of vaccine induces cross-reactive immunity.
Following reports of the new SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.351 expressing multiple mutations across the
spike protein and reduced ability of vaccine induced and convalescent sera to neutralise this
variant virus 5, we generated a new ChAdOx1 vector expressing spike containing the key B.1.351
mutations (Figure 1). To assess the immunogenicity, BALB/c mice were immunised with 108iu
AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), AZD2816 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 B.1.351) or with 108iu of each vaccine
mixed together prior to immunisation (Figure 2A). Comparable levels of anti-spike antibodies were
observed in all groups of vaccinated mice against both wild-type spike and B.1.351 spike protein
(Figure 2B). Mixing both vaccines together did not compromise the antibody response to either
spike protein, nor was there a difference between total ELISA Units measured on day 9 or day 16
post-vaccination (Figure 2B). This rapid onset of a measurable antibody response suggests this
vaccine is highly immunogenic. Neutralising antibodies, measured in pseudotyped virus
neutralisation assay, were detected against original wild-type and B.1.351 (Figure 2C).
T cell responses were measured by IFN ELISpot with splenocytes stimulated with peptide pools
containing peptides common to both vaccines, wild-type spike peptides or B.1.351 peptides (Table
S2). Equivalent numbers of IFN producing cells were detected against all pools of spike peptides
at both timepoints measured (Figure 2D), with responses to the common peptides dominating the
response and minimal responses observed against variant regions. Consistent with earlier studies
6, the T cell response was dominant towards the first 2 peptide pools corresponding to the S1
portion of the protein (Figure 2E) across all vaccine groups.

Antibody responses are boosted by vaccination with variant vaccine AZD2816

To determine whether a booster vaccination with a variant vaccine was impacted in the presence
of a response to the wild-type spike protein, mice were immunised with one dose of AZD1222
prior to boosting with AZD2816 and antibody responses compared across relevant groups. Total
IgG responses, measured by ELISA, showed that a booster dose of AZD2816 increased the
antibody titre against wild-type spike and B.1.351 spike (Figure 3A). In addition, boosting AZD1222
primed mice with AZD2816 increased the antibody titre against other variant proteins including
P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.429 (Epsilon) when compared with a single dose of AZD1222 (Figure 3B).
Neutralising antibody titres were also higher against the wild-type, B.1.351, B.1.617.1 (Kappa) or
B.1.617.2 (Delta) (variants of concern) in two dose regimens with AZD1222 and AZD2816 (Figure
3C and Table 1).

AZD2816 as a third dose maintains T cell responses
To maximise the vaccine induced immune response and associated vaccine efficacy against
disease, AZD1222 has been authorised for use in a 2-dose vaccination regimen. To determine the
impact of immunisation with AZD2816 after the clinically recommended dosing regimen, BALB/c
mice received two doses of AZD1222 4 weeks apart and were boosted with 108 iu of AZD2816 or
remained unboosted (Figure 4A). Although a booster dose with AZD2816 did not further increase
the frequency of antigen specific T cells (Figure 4B), the breadth of the cellular immune response
remained consistent (Figure 4B). The cellular immune response is dominated by responses to
common SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides with minimal reactivity against peptides from either original
spike WT or B.1.153 as measured after a single dose of vaccine (Figure 2). Most importantly, a
third dose vaccination with AZD2816 did not alter T cell response with CD4+ T cells shown to
produce primarily IFN, and no-significant difference in the proportion or number of T effector
(Teff), T effector memory (Tem) or T central memory (Tcm) CD4+ T cells observed, (Figure 4C).
Consistent with previous data in mice 6, the anti-spike cell-mediated response was dominated by
CD8+ T cells, with a high frequency of CD8+ T cells producing IFN and TNF was observed in both
groups of mice (Figure 4D left), with a response dominated by Teff and Tem CD8+ T cells, that was
similar between vaccine regimens.

AZD2816 as a third dose can further enhance antibody responses induced by two doses of
AZD1222
Antibody responses were also compared between mice receiving a homologous AZD1222 two
dose regimen or with a third dose AZD2816 vaccination. A significant increase in total IgG ELISA
units was observed against wild-type spike following a booster dose, while a small (albeit not
statistically significant) increase against B.1.351 protein was observed (Figure 5B). Antibody
binding was observed against all variant spike proteins (Figure 5C), with significantly higher
responses observed in AZD2816 boosted mice against variant proteins B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.429
(Figure 5C). Neutralising responses were detected in all vaccine groups against wild-type spike,
B.1.351, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (Table 1), with higher neutralisation titres against the two variant
proteins observed in AZD2816 boosted animals (Figure 5D).
Overall the data shows that a booster dose with a new ChAdOx1 against the new variant B.1.351
(AZD2816), can further enhance antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 and provide
cross-reactivity against other variant proteins.

Discussion:
In populations where vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been widely used the impact on
prevention of severe disease, hospitalisation and death has been demonstrated, but variant

viruses with mutations in the spike protein are now in circulation, and the efficacy of the original
vaccines against VoCs may be reduced.
The VoC B.1.351 was first identified in South Africa and was thought to have driven the second
wave of infection resulting in a larger proportion of young individuals being infected than
previously seen, with health officials indicating that B.1.351 spreads faster than other variants.
B.1.351 contains several mutations across the S1 portion of spike protein. In particular, three
mutations involved in binding of spike to the ACE2 receptor have been shown to increase the
strength of spike-ACE2 binding, with some antibodies from convalescent or vaccinated individuals
showing reduced ability to neutralise this variant virus 5. A number of common amino acid changes
within the RBD and NTD region of the spike protein have been identified amongst SARS-CoV-2
variants (Table S2). The D614G identified in all VoC, increases virus infectivity 7,8, potentially
through increased density of spike on the virion surface 9. The L452R change is present in B.1.429,
B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 shown to reduce sensitivity of neutralising antibodies 7. The E484K is
present in B.1.351 and P.1 isolates is believed to enhance binding affinity of RBD to ACE2 10,11 and
evasion from antibodies 12. The N501Y is present in B.1.351, B.1.1.7 and P.1 variants alone does
not appear to significantly impact neutralisation, but N501Y in combination with E484K and D614G
can affect sera neutralisation titres 13,14. A high proportion of isolated neutralising anti-spike
antibody bind to the RBD domain of spike 15-17, there is concern these cumulative changes are
leading to the reduced ability of antibodies induced against WT SARS-CoV-2 to neutralise VoCs
5,18,19.
The mRNA and viral vector technologies that allowed rapid production of vaccines against SARSCoV-2 in early 2020 can be readily employed to express the spike protein from VoCs rather than
the original virus. Here we generated AZD2816, a new ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine expressing
B.1.351 spike protein and assessed the immunogenicity in mice. As priming of the immune
response to the original wild-type spike protein may impact the ability to switch specificity of the
response to B.1.351, we measured antibody and T cell responses after one or two doses of the
original ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) followed by a single dose of AZD2816.
While a single dose of either AZD1222 or AZD2816 induces rapid T cells and antibodies capable of
binding and neutralising wild-type and B.1.351 spike protein, antibody responses can be increased
with a booster dose of either AZD1222 or AZD2816. Importantly, we saw no evidence that priming
of the immune system response was detrimental when mice received a booster dose of ChAdOx1
expressing B.1.351 expressing protein. Equivalent high levels of T cells were observed, with
equivalent cytokines produced and populations of effector and memory T cells (Figure 4). Boosting
mice with one dose of AZD2816 after a one or two doses of AZD1222 led to an increase in binding
antibody titres in addition to neutralisation against B.1.351 and both B.1.617 variants. In addition,
higher antibody titres against P.1, B.1.1.7. B.1.429 and D614G spike was also observed.
Ongoing surveillance has identified B.1.617.2 as a VoC that is spreading rapidly within the UK and
elsewhere. Two dose vaccination with AZD1222 induces antibodies capable of neutralising
B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 (Table 1), and early real-world evidence suggest that the effectiveness of
this regimen against hospitalisation and death is maintained
(https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/
file/988619/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_12_England.pdf). Encouragingly
neutralisation can be further enhanced with a 3rd dose of vaccine (Table 1), supporting the clinical
assessment of these regimens.
The data presented herein demonstrates that vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)
induces high titre cross-reactive antibodies capable of neutralising a number of SARS-CoV-2
variants of concern, B.1.351, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2. Most importantly these responses can be
further enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine expressing the spike protein from B.1.351. These

data support clinical assessment of AZD2816 in vaccine naïve individuals as well as those
previously vaccinated with AZD1222.

Methods:
Vector Construction;
AZD2816 vaccine was constructed as previously described 20. In brief, the B.1.351 glycoprotein (S)
gene 4 was codon-optimized for expression in human cell lines and synthesized with the tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence at the 5′ end by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The S gene was inserted into the Gateway® recombination cassette of the shuttle
plasmid containing a human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (IE CMV), which
includes intron A and two tetracycline operator 2 sites, and the bovine growth hormone
polyadenylation signal. BACs containing the ChAdOx1 SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 Spike protein were
prepared by Gateway® recombination between the ChAdOx1 destination DNA BAC vector 21 and
the shuttle plasmids containing the SARS CoV-2 S gene expression cassettes using standard
protocols resulting in the insertion of the SARS-CoV-2 expression cassette at the E1 locus. The
ChAdOx1 SARS CoV-2 S adenovirus genome was excised from the BAC using unique PmeI sites
flanking the adenovirus genome sequence. ChAdOx1 SARS CoV-2 S viral vectors were rescued in TRExTM cells (Invitrogen, Cat. R71007), a derivative of HEK293 cells which constitutively express the
Tet repressor protein and prevent antigen expression during virus production. The resultant virus,
ChAdOx1 nCov-19 B.1.351 (AZD2816), was purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation as
described previously. The titres were determined on T-RExTM cells using anti-hexon
immunostaining assay based on the QuickTiter™ Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay kit (Cell Biolabs
Inc).

Ethics Statement; Mice were used in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986 under project license number P9804B4F1 granted by the UK Home Office with approval from
the local Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board (AWERB) at the University of Oxford. Age
matched animals were purchased from commercial suppliers as a batch for each experiment and
randomly split into groups on arrival at our facility. Animals were group housed in IVCs under SPF
conditions, with constant temperature (20-24oC) and humidity (45-65%) with lighting on a 13:11
light-dark cycle (7am to 8pm). For induction of short-term anaesthesia, animals were
anaesthetised using vaporised IsoFlo®. All animals were humanely sacrificed at the end of each
experiment by an approved Schedule 1 method.

Animals and Immunizations; Inbred BALB/cOlaHsd (BALB/c) (Envigo) (n=5 to 7 mice per group),
were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) in the musculus tibialis with 108 infectious units (iu) of
ChAdOx1 vector. Mice were boosted with the relevant vaccine candidate 4 weeks later. All mice
were sacrificed 3 weeks (or at a time indicated on figure legend) after the final vaccination with
serum and spleens collected for analysis of humoral and cell-mediated immunity.

Antigen specific IgG ELISA; MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) were coated with 250ng/well of full-length
SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) spike (NC_045512), B.1.351 spike, B.1.1.7 spike, P.1 spike, B.1.429
spike and original wild-type spike sequence with a D to G amino acid substitution at position 614
(D614G) protein (Table S1) overnight at 4 °C, prior to washing in PBS/Tween (0.05% v/v) and
blocking with Blocker Casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT).
Standard positive serum (pool of mouse serum with high endpoint titre against original wild-type
spike protein), individual mouse serum samples, negative and an internal control (diluted in

casein) were incubated for 2 hrs at RT. Following washing, bound antibodies were detected by
addition of a 1 in 5000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour at RT and addition of p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate, Disodium Salt substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich). An arbitrary number of ELISA units (EU) were assigned to the reference pool and
optical density values of each dilution were fitted to a 4-parameter logistic curve using SOFTmax
PRO software. ELISA units were calculated for each sample using the optical density values of the
sample and the parameters of the standard curve. All data was log-transformed for presentation
and statistical analyses.

Micro neutralisation test (mVNT) using lentiviral-based pseudotypes bearing the SARS-CoV-2
Spike; Spike-expressing plasmid constructs were generated using the QuikChange Lightning Multi
Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent) on a previously described Wuhan-hu-1 template22.
Lentiviral-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses were generated in HEK293T cells incubated at
37 °C, 5% CO2 as previously described 23. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 x 105 in 6
well dishes, before being transfected with plasmids as follows: 500 ng of SARS-CoV-2 spike
(NC_045512, B.1.351, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2) (Table S1), 600 ng p8.91 (encoding for HIV-1 gag-pol),
600 ng CSFLW (lentivirus backbone expressing a firefly luciferase reporter gene), in Opti-MEM
(Gibco) along with 10 µL PEI (1 µg/mL) transfection reagent. A ‘no glycoprotein’ control was also
set up using the pcDNA3.1 vector instead of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressing plasmid. The
following day, the transfection mix was replaced with 3 mL DMEM with 10% FBS (DMEM-10%) and
incubated for 48 and 72 hours, after which supernatants containing pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2
(SARS-CoV-2 pps) were harvested, pooled and centrifuged at 1,300 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C to
remove cellular debris. Target HEK293T cells, previously transfected with 500 ng of a human ACE2
expression plasmid (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA) were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 4 in 100 µL
DMEM-10% in a white flat-bottomed 96-well plate one day prior to harvesting SARS-CoV-2 pps.
The following day, SARS-CoV-2 pps were titrated 10-fold on target cells, and the remainder stored
at -80 °C. For mVNTs, sera was diluted 1 in 20 in serum-free media and 50 µL was added to a 96well plate in triplicate and titrated 2-fold. A fixed titred volume of SARS-CoV-2 pps was added at a
dilution equivalent to 105 to 106 signal luciferase units in 50 µL DMEM-10% and incubated with
sera for 1 hour at 37 °C, 5% CO2 (giving a final sera dilution of 1 in 40). Target cells expressing
human ACE2 were then added at a density of 2 x 104 in 100 µL and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for
72 hours. Firefly luciferase activity was then measured with BrightGlo luciferase reagent and a
Glomax-Multi+ Detection System (Promega, Southampton, UK). Pseudotyped virus neutralisation
titres were calculated by interpolating the point at which there was 80% reduction in luciferase
activity, relative to untreated controls (80% neutralisation, inhibitory dilution 80, ID80).

ELISpot and ICS staining; Spleen single cell suspension were prepared by passing cells through
70μM cell strainers and treatment with ammonium potassium chloride lysis solution prior to
resuspension in complete media. Splenocytes were stimulated 15mer peptides (overlapping by 11)
spanning the length of SARS-CoV-2 protein and tpa promoter, with peptide pools subdivided into
common and variant peptide regions within the S1 and S2 region of spike (Figure 1A) (Table S2).
For analysis of IFN production by ELISpot, splenocytes were stimulated with two pools of S1
peptides (pools 1 and 2) and two pools of S2 peptides (pools 3 and 4) (final concentration of
2µg/mL) on hydrophobic-PVDF ELISpot plates (Merck) coated with 5µg/mL anti-mouse IFN
(AN18). After 18-20 hours of stimulation at 37oC, IFN spot forming cells (SFC) were detected by
staining membranes with anti-mouse IFN biotin (1mg/mL) (R46A2) followed by streptavidinAlkaline Phosphatase (1mg/mL) and development with AP conjugate substrate kit (BioRad, UK).
Spots were enumerated using an AID ELISpot reader and software (AID).

For analysis of intracellular cytokine production, cells were stimulated at 37oC for 6 hours with
2μg/mL a pool of S1 (ELISpot pools 1 and 2) or S2 (ELISpot pools 3 and 4) total original spike
peptides (Table S2), media or positive control cell stimulation cocktail (containing PMA-Ionomycin,
BioLegend), together with 1μg/mL Golgi-plug (BD) and 2μl/mL CD107a-Alexa647 (Clone 1D4B).
Following surface staining with CD3-A700 (Clone 17A2, 1 in 100), CD4-BUV496 (Clone GK1.5, 1 in
200), CD8-BUV395 (Clone 53-6.7, 1 in 200), CD11a-PECy7 (Clone H155-78, 1 in 200), CD44-BV780
(Clone IM7, 1 in 100), CD62L-BV711 (Clone MEL-14, 1 in 100), CD69-PECy7 (Clone H1.2F3, 1 in
100), CD103-APCCy7 (Clone 2E7, 1 in 100) and CD127-BV650 (Clone A7R34, 1 in 100) cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained intracellularly with IL2-PerCPCy5.5 (Clone JES6-5H4,
1 in 100), IL4-BV605 (Clone 11B11, 1 in 100), IL10-PE (Clone JES5-16E3, 1 in 100), IFN-e450 (Clone
XMG1.2, 1 in 100) and TNF-A488 (Clone MP6-XT22, 1 in 100) diluted in Perm-Wash buffer (BD).
Sample acquisition was performed on a Fortessa (BD) and data analyzed in FlowJo V10 (TreeStar).
An acquisition threshold was set at a minimum of 5000 events in the live CD3 + gate. Antigen
specific T cells were identified by gating on LIVE/DEAD negative, size (FSC-A vs SSC), doublet
negative (FSC-H vs FSC-A), CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ cells and each individual cytokine. T cell subsets
were gated within the population of “IFN+ or TNF+” responses and are presented after
subtraction of the background response detected in the corresponding media stimulated control
sample for each mouse, and summing together the response detected to each pool of peptides. T
effector (Teff) cells were defined as CD62Llow CD127low, T effector memory (Tem) cells defined as
CD62Llow CD127hi and T central memory (Tcm) cells defined as CD62Lhi CD127hi (Figure S1). The
total number of cells was calculated by multiplying the frequency of the background corrected
population (expressed as a percentage of total lymphocytes) by the total number of lymphocytes
counted in each individual spleen sample.

Statistical analysis; All graphs and statistical analysis were performed using Prism v9 (Graphpad).
For analysis of vaccination regimen against a single variable (eg IgG level), data was analysed with
a one-way anova (Kruskal-Wallis) followed by post-hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test. For
analysis of vaccination regimen against multiple variables (eg each individual cytokine or T cell
subset) the data was analysed with a two-way analysis of variance, where a significant difference
was observed, a post-hoc analysis was performed to compare the overall effect of vaccination
regimen. In graphs where a significant difference was observed between multiple vaccine groups,
the highest p value is displayed on the graph. All data displayed on a logarithmic scale was log 10
transformed prior to statistical analysis (ELISA Units, Neutralisation Titres, Total Cell Numbers).

Functional ability of antibodies to neutralise pseudotyped virus expressing original spike, B.1.351
or B.1.617 spike protein was measured in the serum of vaccinated mice. Pseudotyped virus
neutralization titres are expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that inhibited luciferase
expression by 50% (ID50) or 80% (ID80). Table shows the median (min to max) per group.

Figure 1: Schematic of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and peptide pools used in studies
Schematic is a graphical representation of spike protein indicating location of the signal sequence
(SS), N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor binding domain (RBD, receptor binding motif (RBM),
fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) regions, transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail
(CT). Peptide pools used to stimulate splenocytes were sub-divided into 4 pools to cover the S1
and S2 regions of spike. Amino acid changes between original and B.1.351 variant virus and
encoded in the AZD2816 vaccine construct are indicated.

Figure S1: Flow cytometry gating strategy
Antigen specific T cells were identified by gating on LIVE/DEAD negative, size (FSC-A vs SSC),
doublet negative (FSC-H vs FSC-A), CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ cells and each individual cytokine. T effector
(Teff) cells were defined as CD62Llow CD127low, T effector memory (Tem) cells defined as CD62Llow
CD127hi and T central memory (Tcm) cells defined as CD62Lhi CD127hi. T cell subsets were gated
within the population of “IFN+ or TNF+” responses and are presented after subtraction of the
background response detected in the corresponding media stimulated control sample (A.) from
the S1 (B.) or S2 peptide stimulated sample for each mouse, and summing together the response
detected to each pool of peptides.
