Abstract

37
38

During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein

39

emerged and became the predominant circulating variant (S-614G) of the COVID-19 pandemic1.

40

However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage

41

that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects

42

remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-

43

614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human ACE2, (ii) increased replication in primary

44

human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in

45

mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret

46

models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G

47

substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, it provides a real

48

competitive advantage in vivo, particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an

49

explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses

50

currently circulating.

Main Text

52

In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in

53

Wuhan, Hubei province, China2,3 and rapidly developed into the COVID-19 pandemic. By the

54

end of September 2020, the worldwide death toll had passed one million people with more than

55

37 million infections4. Symptoms are usually mild; however in more vulnerable groups, such as

56

aged individuals or people with comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 can cause life-threatening

57

pneumonia5. Cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the interaction of the spike glycoprotein

58

(S) and the host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)3,6. S is a

59

homotrimeric class I fusion protein consisting of two subunits S1 and S2, which are separated by

60

a protease cleavage site. The S1 forms a globular head and is essential for receptor binding,

61

while S2 is responsible for fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes. During the

62

entry process, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) within the S1 subunit binds ACE2, generating

63

conformational changes in the S2 subunit, which facilitates virus internalization7,8. S-D614G is a

64

protein variant containing a substitution in the S protein outside of the RBD and is thought to

65

cause a conformational change. It is believed to weaken the interprotomer latch in the S protein

66

trimer between the S1 and S2 domains and causes a more “open” conformation that improves

67

ACE2 binding and increases the probability of infection 1,9. Over the course of the pandemic, the

68

SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant rapidly superseded the parental S-614D variant in frequency to

69

become globally dominant. Such a shift in genotype frequency might be caused by a founder

70

effect following introduction into a highly interconnected population. However, there are

71

multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the S-614G variant may confer a fitness advantage

72

compared to S-614D: increased frequency of S-614G in distinct geographical regions, initial

73

experimental evidence with pseudotyped lentiviruses9 or vesicular stomatitis viruses 8, and

74

reports of the S-614G variant being associated with higher viral loads1. To better address the

75

role that the S-D614G substitution has played in the dissemination and predominance of this

76

SARS-CoV-2 variant during the COVID-19 pandemic, we characterized S protein binding to

77

human ACE2 (hACE2) and replication kinetics in vitro, and evaluated infection and transmission

78

dynamics in vivo using three different animal models. The data show that the S-D614G

79

substitution confers increased binding to the hACE2 receptor and increased replication in

80

primary human airway epithelial cultures. Moreover, comparison of recombinant isogenic

81

SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrates that S-614G substitution provides competitive advantage in

82

a hACE2 knock-in mouse model, and markedly increases replication and transmission in Syrian

83

hamster and ferret models.

Results

86

SARS-CoV-2 S-614G binds to hACE2 more efficiently

87

To determine whether the S-D614G substitution directly affects the binding between the S and

88

hACE2, we first used the biolayer interferometry (BLI) technology to quantify their biding

89

affinity. Because the S1 component of the S is the domain that interacts with receptor, a

90

reductionist approach was used to determine if the D614G played a role in hACE2 binding by

91

monomeric S1 proteins. Pre-biotinylated polyhistidine-tagged S1 proteins with 614D or 614G

92

(S1-614D and S1-614G, respectively) both bind efficiently to hACE2; however, S1-614G (KD =

93

1.65 nM) showed about 2-fold higher affinity than S1-614D (KD = 3.74 nM) (Figure 1A). When

94

the full-length monomeric spike ectodomain was used in the assay, the S-614G protein also

95

showed higher affinity to hACE2 than S-614D (Extended Data Figure 1A). The enhanced

96

binding to hACE2 protein rendered by the S-D614G substitution also resulted in enhanced S1

97

binding to Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells expressing exogenous hACE2 (BHK-hACE2) in a

98

different binding assay (Figure 1B, Extended Data Figure 1B). We incubated polyhistidine-

99

tagged S1-614D or S1-614G proteins with BHK-hACE2 and analyzed the binding efficiency of

100

S1 to the cells using flow cytometry. At the same S1 concentration, more S1-614G bound to the

101

BHK-hACE2 cells than S1-614D (Figure 1B, Extended Data Figure 1B). Recombinant S1

102

constructs that express two S1 molecules attached to an IgG carboxyl-terminus were generated to

103

further evaluate the impact the S-D614G substitution. An even more striking difference was

104

observed with the pair of Fc(IgG)-tagged S1-614D or S1-614G proteins used for binding studies

105

instead of polyhistidine-tagged S1 constructs (Figure 1B, Extended Data Figure 1B).

107

Increased replication of SARS-CoV-2S-614G virus in primary human epithelial cells

108

To assess the impact of S-614G in the context of virus infection we generated an isogenic

109

D614G virus pair based on our reverse genetics system for SARS-CoV-210. The molecular clone

110

is based on the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate possessing the S-614D variant (SARS-CoV-2S-614D)

111

The sequence of the isogenic S-614G variant was engineered to have an A to G nucleotide

112

change at position 23,403 to encode a glycine at the S protein position 614. The identity of the

113

resulting recombinant SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant was confirmed by full-length sequencing from

114

the passage 1 virus stock that was used for subsequent experiments. Replication kinetics of

115

SARS-CoV-2S-614D and SARS-CoV-2S-614G in Vero E6 cells marginally differed (Figure 1C). We

116

assessed replication kinetics in primary human nasal epithelial (hNE) and primary normal human

117

bronchial epithelial (NhBE) cultures that were grown under air-liquid interface conditions and

118

resemble the pseudostratified epithelial lining of the human respiratory epithelium. No

121

contrast, SARS-CoV-2S-614G displayed elevated titers in primary NhBE cells at temperatures of

122

33°C, 37°C and 39°C, that resemble temperatures of the upper and lower respiratory tract, or

variant (Extended Data Figure 1C). To refine this analysis, we performed competition

systems, the ratio of 614G:614D shifted in favor of SARS-CoV-2S-614G during five or eight days

daily in oropharyngeal swabs and in various organs and tissues by real-time PCR at days 2 and 4

143

post infection (p.i.). No significant body weight loss in hACE2-KI mice up to day 4 p.i. were

144

observed (Extended Data Figure 2B). Longitudinal analysis of daily oropharyngeal swabs

145

revealed efficient virus replication in the upper respiratory tract of hACE2-KI mice (Figure 2B).

146

Accordingly, tissue samples collected at day 2 and 4 p.i. revealed high viral RNA loads in the

147

nasal conchae, lungs and olfactory bulbs and at lower levels in the brain (Extended Data Figure

148

2C). Low to undetectable levels of virus were observed in spleen, small intestine, kidneys and

149

feces (data not shown). No overt pathological lesions were found in the lungs of hACE2-KI

150

compared to wild-type mice at day 2 and 4 p.i. (Extended Data Table 1, 2). Sequencing analysis

151

of the oropharyngeal swabs revealed a net advantage for the SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant over

152

SARS-CoV-2S-614D variant in most animals and time points (Figure 2C). In the organs, a similar

153

replication advantage was found for the SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant (Figure 2D). Collectively,

154

these results demonstrate increased replication of SARS-CoV-2S-614G in a mouse model of SARS-

155

CoV-2 infection in the context of the expression of the authentic human receptor hACE2.

156
157

SARS-CoV-2S-614G displays increased replication and transmissibility in hamsters and

158

ferrets

159

Hamsters are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and develop disease that closely

160

resembles pan-respiratory, fulminant COVID-19 disease in humans14,15. In contrast, in ferrets

161

SARS-CoV-2 primarily replicates within the upper respiratory tract, resembling mild human

162

infections. However, both animal models efficiently reflect transmission events by direct contact.

163

By using a competition experimental approach in vivo, as shown for the hACE2-KI mice,

164

numerical dominance of one recombinant variant should be the result of relevant advantages.

165

Therefore, direct “one-to-one" transmission experiments were conducted. Six donor Syrian

166

hamsters were inoculated i.n. at equal ratios with SARS-CoV-2S-614D and SARS-CoV-2S-614G

167

using 1x104.77 TCID50/animal (calculated from back titration of the original material). Analysis

168

of the mixed inoculum by amplicon sequencing and absolute quantification using allele specific

169

locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes confirmed similar viral RNA ratios of both variants (Figure 3).

170

At 24 hours after inoculation, each donor was cohoused with one naive hamster. Weight

171

changes, as well as clinical signs were monitored and nasal washes were collected daily. Viral

172

RNA load in nasal washings, and changes in body weight, were congruent to previously

173

published data14,15 (Extended Data Figure 3A, B).

174

composition of nasal washings revealed a prominent shift towards SARS-CoV-2S-614G within

175

48 hours post inoculation (Figure 3). Transmission efficiency was one hundred percent, and

176

analysis of the RNA sequence composition showed that the SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant

177

represented ˃90% of the viral RNA in the contact animals (Figure 3). In summary, hamsters

178

inoculated with both variants, SARS-CoV-2S-614D and SARS-CoV-2S-614G, in an equal ratio,

179

transmit primarily SARS-CoV-2S-614G.

180

To exclude possible differences in hamster's affinity to one variant or divergence of kinetics of

181

the replication cycle six hamsters were inoculated i.n. with either SARS-CoV-2S-614D (1x 105.1

182

TCID50/animal, calculated from back titration of the original material), or SARS-CoV-2S-614G

183

(104.5 TCID50/animal, calculated from back titration of the original material) and were monitored

184

for four consecutive days. No marked differences in body weights, titers of shed virus, or viral

185

loads in respiratory tract tissue were observed between the two groups in the acute phase

186

(Extended Data Figure 3C-E). For both variants, highest genome loads were found in the nasal

187

conchae, followed by pulmonary tissue (Extended Data Figure 3E). These observations confirm

188

that in the case of SARS-CoV-2S-614D or SARS-CoV-2S-614G infections, the S-D614G substitution

189

does not seem crucial for clinical outcomes, which again underscores the hamster as a highly

190

sensitive disease model. Rather, the advantage of the SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant over the SARS-

191

CoV-2S-614D has to be adequately large to fully suppress the latter variant within a single in vivo

192

replication cycle, which accurately reflects the evolution of SARS-CoV-2S-614G in humans during

193

the COVID-19 pandemic.

194

Since ferrets are a good transmission model 18, we performed a direct “one-to-one" transmission

195

experiment using an equal mixture of the isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants. Six animals were

196

intranasally inoculated with the mix of SARS-CoV-2S-614D and SARS-CoV-2S-614G (105.4

197

TCID50/animal calculated from back titration of the original material). For all six inoculated

198

ferrets SARS-CoV-2-infection could be confirmed, and both body weight changes and viral

199

RNA loads in nasal washings (Figure 4, Extended Data Figure 4A, B) reflected published

200

data16,17. In five of the six inoculated ferrets, SARS-CoV-2S-614G became the dominant variant

201

(Figure 4). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred in four of the six ferret pairs, and in

202

each pair with successful transmission the S-614G variant prevailed over S-614D (Figure 4). All

203

amplicon sequencing data of the ferret samples were also retested by absolute quantification

204

using allele specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes and digital PCR analysis.

205

Notably, the donor of pair one with the dominance of SARS-CoV-2S-614D did not transmit despite

206

a high viral genome peak load of more than 10 million copies per ml. In contrast, the lack of

207

transmission in pair 4 where SARS-CoV-2S-614G became the dominant variant is connected to

208

peak viral loads of below 500,000 genome copies per ml (Figure 4). In summary, the competition

209

experiment in ferrets revealed that the SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant preferentially infected and

replicated in five out of six inoculated animals, and transmission events succeeded exclusively

211

with the SARS-CoV-2S-614G variant.

212

Discussion

213

SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans has been proposed to be a non-deterministic process and

214

virus diversification results mainly from random genetic drift, suggesting that there is no strong

215

selective pressure on SARS-CoV-2 in its adaptation to humans20. However, since the

216

introduction of the S-D614G change in early 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant has become

217

globally prevalent1. A founder effect and a structural change of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

218

have been proposed as driving forces establishing the S-614G prevalence. Previous structural

219

studies and the use of pseudotyped viruses have put forward the idea that the S-614G variant

220

may confer increased infectivity, which could be a result of increased “open” RBD conformation

221

for receptor binding as suggested by one study or increased S stability as suggested by another

222

study1,9. In contrast to those studies that used recombinant trimeric S, we used a reductionist

223

approach to eliminate the complications due to the “open” or “closed” RBD conformations in

224

trimeric S. We found the S1 or the monomeric S ectodomain with D614G substitution had

225

increased affinity to hACE2, which may be another mechanism underlying the increased

226

replication and transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G variant.

227

Studies that employed isogenic SARS-CoV-2 D614G variants to assess the phenotype in the

228

context of a SARS-CoV-2 infection were only very recently reported in preprints

229

studies conclude that the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant shows increased replication in vitro and

230

one study observed earlier transmission in a hamster model. We extended these studies by

231

exploiting various in vitro and in vivo infection models of SARS-CoV-2, including primary

232

NhBE and hNE cultures, a novel hACE2 knock-in mouse model, a hamster model, and a ferret

233

model. Importantly, throughout these experimental systems we consistently observed an

234

increased fitness of SARS-CoV-2S-614G over SARS-CoV-2S-614D by applying amplicon

235

sequencing techniques as well as allele specific absolute quantification for confirmation. The

236

advantage provided by the D614G change becomes most prominent in competition and

237

transmission experiments in hamsters and ferrets and must therefore be considered as a driving

238

force leading to the global dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 614G variant.

239

Our data are also in agreement with reported functional changes conferred by the D614G

substitution in the S protein1 and infections studies using pseudotyped viruses demonstrating

increased infection9,21. Although our studies establish a phenotype of increased replication and

242

transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 S-614G variant, there is no evidence for a phenotypic change

243

in pathogenicity in an animal model. This is important to state, because infection with the SARS-

244

CoV-2 S-614G variant is not associated with the development of severe COVID-19 in humans1.

245

The ongoing pandemic will likely give rise to additional SARS-CoV-2 variants that may display

246

phenotypic changes and further adaptations to humans. The ability to rapidly trace the genetic

247

variability of emerging variants using whole-genome sequencing, reconstructing emerging virus

248

variants, and assessing their phenotypes will allow rapid response to their emergence with

249

appropriate countermeasures. The development, improvement and characterization of suitable

250

animal models that recapitulate SARS-CoV-2 replication, transmission and pathogenicity in

251

humans will provide a platform to assess the potential implications of these emerging variants.

252

The novel mouse model based on hACE2 expression under the endogenous regulatory elements

253

of the mouse Ace2 gene will be a valuable tool and will complement existing animal models of

254

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, as we have shown here, to demonstrate increased replication

255

and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2S-614G, the phenotypic assessment of future pandemic

Affinity between human ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S1-614D, S1-614G, S-614D or S-614G were

454

evaluated using Octet RED96 instrument at 30°C with a shaking speed at 1000 RPM (ForteBio).

455

Streptavidin biosensors (SA) (ForteBio) were used. S1 proteins were pre-biotinylated using EZ-

456

Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin (ThermoFisher Scientific). Following 20 minutes of pre-hydration of

457

SA biosensors and 1 minute of sensor check, 100 nM S1-614D or S1-614G in 10X kinetic buffer

458

(ForteBio) were loaded onto surface of SA biosensors for 5 minutes. After 2 minutes of baseline

459

equilibration, 10 minutes of association was conducted at 2.5 to 75 nM of human ACE2,

460

followed by 20 minutes of dissociation in the same buffer, which was used for baseline

461

equilibration. S proteins with Avi-tag were pre-biotinylated using BirA biotin-protein ligase

462

standard reaction kit (Avidity). 25 nM S-614D or 15 nM S-614G in 10X kinetic buffer

463

(ForteBio) were loaded onto surface of SA biosensors for 5 minutes. After 2 minutes of baseline

464

equilibration, 5 minutes of association was used for 2 to 32 nM hACE2, followed by 10 minutes

465

of dissociation in 10X kinetic buffer. The data were corrected by subtracting reference sample,

466

1:1 binding model with global fit was used for determination of affinity constants.

Generation of infectious cDNA clones using TAR cloning and rescue of recombinant

482

viruses

483

To introduce the 614G mutation to the Spike gene, PCR mutagenesis (Supplementary Table 1)

484

was performed on the pUC57 plasmid containing SARS-CoV-2 fragment 1010 using Q5® Site-

485

Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England BioLab). Both D614 and G614 infectious cDNA clones

486

were generated using in-yeast TAR cloning method as describe previously10. In vitro

487

transcription was performed for EagI-cleaved YACs and PCR-amplified SARS-CoV-2 N gene

488

using the T7 RiboMAX Large Scale RNA production system (Promega) as described

489

previously26. Transcribed capped mRNA was electroporated into baby hamster kidney (BHK-21)

490

cells expressing SARS-CoV N protein. Electroporated cells were co-cultured with susceptible

491

Vero E6 cells to produce passage 0 (P.0) of the recombinant S-614D and S-614G viruses.

492

Subsequently, progeny viruses were used to infect fresh Vero E6 cells to generate P.1 stocks for

493

downstream experiments.

499

infection (MOI) of 0.01. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed three times

500

with PBS followed by supply with appropriate culture medium.

501

Plaque forming unit (PFU) per ml of recombinant S-614D and S614-G viruses were determined

502

by plaque assay in a 24-well format. One day before infection, Vero E6 cells were seeded at a

503

density of 2.0 x 105 cells per ml. After washing once with PBS, cells were inoculated with

504

viruses serially diluted in cell culture medium at 1:10 dilution. After 1 h of incubation, inoculum

505

was removed, and cells were washed with PBS and subsequently overlaid with 1:1 mix of 2.4%

506

Avicel and 2X DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 200 units ml-1 penicillin and

507

200 µg ml-1 streptomycin. After 2 days of incubation at 37oC, cells were fixed in 4% (v/v)

508

neutral-buffered formalin before stained with crystal violet.

509

Statistical significance was determined by two-sided unpaired Student's t-test without adjustment

510

for multiple comparisons.

Infection of human nasal and bronchial epithelial cells

513

Primary human nasal epithelial cultures (hNE; MucilAir™ EP02, Epithelix Sàrl, Genèva,

514

Switzerland) were purchased and handled according to the manufacturer instructions. Normal

515

human bronchial epithelial (NhBE) cells were purchased (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA)

516

and cultured according to recommended protocols. The hNE cultures were inoculated with

521

experiments, NhBE cells were inoculated with 1:1 or 9:1 mixed SARS-CoV-2S-614D and SARS-

522

CoV-2S-614G at 1x105 PFU per well. After incubation at 33°C for one or two hours, for hNE or

523

NhBE cell cultures respectively, inoculum was removed, cells were washed, and subsequently

524

incubated, as indicated, at 33°C, 37°C, or 39°C. To monitor viral replication, apical washes were

525

collected every 24 hours. All titers were determined by standard plaque-assay or TCID50 on Vero

526

E6 cells.

527

For competition experiments, viral RNA was extracted from apical washes using the QIAamp 96

528

Virus QIAcube HT Kit (QIAGEN). The SARS-CoV-2 genome was amplified using a highly

529

531

modification. Briefly, primers were designed to produce overlapping 1kb amplicons

532

(Supplementary Table 2). Reverse transcriptase was performed as described in the ARTIC

533

protocol. The single cDNA reaction was carried forward by preparing two PCR reactions, one

534

each for the odd and even pools of primers. Two primer pools (odds and evens) were prepared to

535

contain 0.1 µM of each individual primer. Tiling PCR of the resultant cDNA was performed by

536

combining 12.5 µL 2x Q5 polymerase, 5.5 µL water, 2 µL of the primer pool, and 5 µL of cDNA

537

followed by incubating the reaction at 98°C for 30 seconds, 38 cycles of 98°C for 15 seconds

538

and 63°C for 5 minutes, and holding at 4°C. Corresponding odd and even amplicons were

539

normalized and pool for library preparation. Fragmented libraries were prepared using the

RNA extraction and RT-PCR

544

Preparation of viral RNA for next-generation sequencing was performed as described

545

previously10. In brief, Vero E6 cells were infected with P.1 viruses. Extraction of total cellular

546

RNA was done using Nucleospin® RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the

547

manufacturers' instruction.

548

RNA from hNE apical washes and mouse oropharyngeal swabs were prepared using QIAamp®

549

Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) and Nucleospin® RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the

550

manufacturers' protocol.

551

To determine the ratios of S-614D:S-614G in competition assays in Epithelix and hACE2-KI

552

mice, reverse transcription PCR was performed on extracted RNA using SuperScriptTM IV One-

553

step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). The sequence-specific primers were used to generate an

554

amplicon of 905 bp covering the D614G region: 5'-AATCTATCAGGCCGGTAGCAC-3' and 5'-

555

CAACAGCTATTCCAGTTAAAGCAC-3'. RT-PCR reaction was performed in a 50-µl reaction

556

using 0.01 pg to 1µg total RNA. The cycling parameters were set as follows: 50oC for 10 min,

557

98oC for 2 min; 35 cycles at 98oC for 10 sec, 55oC for 15 sec, and 72oC for 30 sec; and a 5-min

558

incubation at 72oC. DNA concentration was determined using Qubit dsDNA HS (High

559

Sensitivity) Assay (Thermo Fisher), and subsequently diluted to 200 ng in 50 µl of nuclease-free

560

water for sequencing by Nanopore sequencing MinION.

565

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2S-614D or SARS-CoV-2S-614G RNAs of P.1 stock were sequenced by

566

next-generation sequencing as described previously10. Briefly, RNA was extracted from Vero E6

567

cells infected with either recombinant SARS-CoV-2S-614D or SARS-CoV-2S-614G using the

568

NucleoSpin RNA Plus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

569

Sequencing libraries were subsequently prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA

570

Library Prep kit (Illumina, 20020595) and pooled cDNA libraries were sequenced across two

571

lanes on a NovaSeq 6000 S1 flow cell (2 x 50bp, 100 cycles) using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000

572

platform (Next Generation Sequencing Platform, University of Bern, Switzerland). For data

573

analysis, TrimGalore v0.6.5 was used to remove low-quality reads and adaptors from the raw

574

sequencing files. The resulting trimmed paired-end reads were then aligned to the SARS-CoV-2

575

genome (GenBank accession MT108784) using Bowtie2 v2.3.5. Finally, a consensus sequence

576

was generated for each virus stock using Samtools v1.10 with the -d option set to 10,000. Data

Human ACE2 knock-in mouse study.

593

Generation of hACE2 knock-in mice. The hACE2-KI(B6) (B6.Cg-Ace2tm1(ACE2)Dwnt/J) line was

594

generated by targeted mutagenesis to express human ACE-2 cDNA in place of the mouse Ace2

595

gene. Thus, in this new animal model, hACE2 expression is regulated by the endogenous mouse

596

Ace2 promoter/enhancer elements. The targeting vector (WEN1-HR) had hACE2 cDNA inserted

597

in frame with the endogenous initiation codon of the mouse Ace2 (Extended Data Figure 2A).

598

The human cDNA was flanked by an FRT-neomycin-FRT-loxP cassette and a distal loxP site.

599

WEN1-HR was used to transfect 129Sv/Pas ES cells and 837 ES cell clones were isolated and

600

screened for homologous recombination by PCR and Southern blot. Eleven properly recombined

601

ES cell clones were identified and some of them were used for blastocyst injection and

602

implantation

603

(129Sv/Pas:C57BL/6) ranging from 50 to 100%. To complete the hACE2 knock-in, we crossed

604

the chimeric males with C57BL/6J Flp-expressing females to excise the FRT flanked neomycin

605

selection cassette and generate the floxed humanised ACE2 allele (Extended Data Figure 2A).

These hACE2 knock-in mice were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern Blot and were

609

Heterozygous hACE2-KI female mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (USA) and

610

C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) female mice were from Janvier Lab (France). All mice were

611

acclimatized for at least 2 weeks in individually ventilated cages (blue line, Tecniplast), with

612

12/12 light/dark cycle, autoclaved acidified water, autoclaved cages including food, bedding and

613

environmental enrichment at the SPF facility of the Institute of Virology and Immunology,

614

Mittelhäusern, Switzerland. One week before infection, mice were placed in individually HEPA-

615

filtered isolators (IsoCage N, Tecniplast). Mice (10-12-week-old) were anesthetized with

616

isoflurane and infected intranasally with 20µl (i.e., 10µl per nostril) with a 1:1 ratio of the

617

SARS-CoV-2 variants (WT and hACE2-KI mice) or mock culture medium (WT mice only).

618

After intranasal infection, mice were monitored daily for body weight loss and clinical signs.

619

Throat swabs were collected daily under brief isoflurane anesthesia using ultrafine sterile flock

620

swabs (Hydraflock, Puritan, 25-3318-H). The tips of the swabs were place in 0.5 mL of RA1

621

lysis buffer (Macherey-Nagel, Ref. 740961) supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol and

622

vortexed. Groups of mice from two independent experiments were euthanized on days 2 and 4

623

p.i. and organs were aseptically dissected avoiding cross-contamination. Systematic tissue

624

sampling was performed: (1) lung right superior lobe, right nasal concha, right olfactory bulb,

625

part of the right brain hemisphere, apical part of the right kidney, parts of the distal small

626

intestine (ileum) were collected for RNA isolation in RA1 lysis buffer; (2) lung middle, inferior

627

and post-caval lobes, left nasal concha, left olfactory bulb, part of the right brain hemisphere,

628

part of the right kidney were collected in MEM; (3) lung left lobe, liver left lobe, left kidney, left

629

brain hemisphere and part of the jejunum and ileum were fixed in buffered formalin. Data were

630

generated from two identically designed independent experiments.

Mouse tissue samples collected in RA1 lysis buffer supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol

632

were homogenized using a Bullet Blender Tissue Homogenizer (Next-Advance). Homogenates

633

were centrifuged for 3 min at 18,000 g and stored at -70°C until processing. Total RNA was

653

Six Syrian hamsters, Mesocricretus auratus, (Janvier Labs, France) were infected intranasally

654

under a short-term inhalation anesthesia with 70 µl of SARS-CoV-2S-614D and SARS-CoV-2S-614G

655

at equal ratios using 104.77 TCID50/animal (calculated from back titration of the original

656

material). After 24 hours of isolated housing in individually ventilated cages (IVCs), six pairs,

657

each with one directly inoculated donor hamster and one sham-inoculated contact hamster were

658

co-housed. The housing of each hamster duo was strictly separated in individual cage systems to

659

prevent spill-over between different pairs. For the following seven days (day 2 until day 8 after

660

infection) and on day 12 after infection, viral shedding was monitored in addition to a daily

661

physical examination and body weighting routine.

662

To evaluate viral shedding, nasal washes were individually collected from each hamster under a

663

short-term isoflurane anesthesia. Starting with the pair’s contact hamster, each nostril was rinsed

664

with 100 µl PBS (1.0x phosphate-buffered saline) and reflux was immediately gathered. A new

665

pipet tip for every nostril and hamster was used to prevent indirect spill-over transmission from

666

one animal to another. Furthermore, in-between the respective pairs, a new anesthesia system

667

was used for each pair of animals. At day 8 post infection, one contact hamster was found dead.

668

Although having lost up to almost 20% of their body weight, every other hamster recovered from

669

disease. Under euthanasia, serum samples were collected from each hamster.

670

For a second experimental setup seven hamsters each were infected via the intranasal route with

Ferret study

679

In accordance with the hamster study, twelve ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) from in-house

680

breeding, were divided into six groups of two individuals. Ferret pairs were of equal age between

681

four and 18 months. In total, four ferrets were female (two pairs) and eight ferrets were male or

682

neutered male (four pairs). The housing of each ferret duo was strictly separated in individual

683

cage systems, to prevent spill-over between different pairs. Per separate cage, one individual

684

ferret was inoculated intranasally, by instillation of 125µl of the aforementioned inoculum

685

(1x105 TCID50/animal; calculated from back titration of the original material) into each nostril

686

under a short-term isoflurane-based inhalation anesthesia. Time points and sampling technique

687

corresponded to the methods used for the hamsters, albeit ferret nasal washing was performed

688

using two times 700µl PBS per animal. The contact-ferret was not inoculated.

698

Düren, Germany). Viral loads in these samples were determined using the nCoV_IP4 RT-PCR28

699

including standard RNAs that where absolute quantified by digital droplet PCR with a sensitivity

700

of 10 copies/reaction. The extracted RNA was afterwards subjected to MinION sequencing and

701

digital droplet PCR. For MinION sequencing, amplicons were produced with primers (WU-21-F:

702

AATCTATCAGGCCGGTAGCAC; WU-86-R: CAACAGCTATTCCAGTTAAAGCAC) using

703

SuperScript IV One-step RT-PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA USA). Amplicons

704

were sequenced on a MinION system using from Oxford Nanopore using Native Barcoding 1-12

705

(EXP-NBD104) and 13-24 (EXP-NBD114), respectively with Ligation Kit SQK-LSK109

706

(Oxford Nanopore; Oxford, UK). Libraries were loaded on R9.4.1 Flow Cells (FLO-MIN106D)

707

on a MinION coupled to a MinIT. Realtime high accuracy basecalling, demultiplexing and

708

barcode and adapter trimming was performed with MinKnow v20.06.17, running Guppy

709

vs4.0.11. Downstream

710

eliminated reads < 800 and > 1100 nt and remaining reads were mapped in subsets of 10,000

711

reads to the amplicon reference undergoing two iterations, with custom sensitivity allowing a

712

maximum of 5% gaps and maximum mismatch 30%. Variants were analyzed on specific position

713

with calculating p-values for every variant. Ratio fraction A/G was calculated from numbers of

714

reads as fraction=Areads/(Areads+Greads).

715

For rare mutation and sequence analysis based on digital PCR, the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR

716

System from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) was used. For RT-PCR, the One-Step RT-ddPCR

717

Advanced Kit for Probes (Bio-Rad) was applied according to the supplier´s instructions. For the

mice (hACE2-KI). The hACE2 cDNA was inserted in frame with the endogeneous initiation

753

codon of mouse Ace2 in exon 2, which was deleted. The hACE2 cDNA was flanked 5’ with a

754

loxP site (black triangle) and 3’ with a FRT-neomycin-FRT-loxP cassette. The targeting

755

construct included a negative selection cassette (PGK-DTA) to improve selection of clones with

homologous recombination. Chimeric male mice transmitting the targeted locus were crossed

757

with Flp-deleter female mice to generate the floxed hACE2 knock-in allele. This allele can be

758

used : (1) without further cre-mediated recombination, as shown here, to study humanized ACE2

759

mice (hACE2-KI), where the hACE2 cDNA is expressed in place of mouse Ace2; (2) after

760

crossing with a cre-deleter mouse line to generate constitutive Ace2 knock-out mice; (3) after

761

crossing with tissue-specific cre line. Ubiquitous and tissue-specific knock-out mice can be

crossed with conventional hACE2 transgenic mice to remove the endogenous mouse ACE2,

763

which could confound pathogenesis studies that may occur due to heterodimerization of ACE2.
