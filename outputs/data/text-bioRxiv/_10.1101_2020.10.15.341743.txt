Abstract:
Effective methods for predicting COVID-19 disease trajectories are urgently
needed. Here, ELISA and coronavirus antigen microarray (COVAM) analysis mapped
antibody epitopes in the plasma of COVID-19 patients (n = 86) experiencing a wide-range
of disease states. The experiments identified antibodies to a 21-residue epitope from
nucleocapsid (termed Ep9) associated with severe disease, including admission to the
ICU, requirement for ventilators, or death. Importantly, anti-Ep9 antibodies can be
detected within six days post-symptom onset and sometimes within one day.
Furthermore, anti-Ep9 antibodies correlate with various comorbidities and hallmarks of
immune hyperactivity. We introduce a simple-to-calculate, disease risk factor score to
quantitate each patient’s comorbidities and age. For patients with anti-Ep9 antibodies,
scores above 3.0 predict more severe disease outcomes with a 13.42 Likelihood Ratio
(96.72% specificity). The results lay the groundwork for a new type of COVID-19
prognostic to allow early identification and triage of high-risk patients. Such information
could guide more effective therapeutic intervention.

Introduction:
The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an ongoing global health crisis. More than
41 million confirmed cases and 1.1 million deaths have been reported worldwide as of
October 23, 2020 (1). The virus that causes COVID-19, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), belongs to the same family of viruses responsible
for respiratory illness linked to recent epidemics – severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS-CoV-1 termed SARS here) in 2002-2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) in 2012 (2). The current and previous outbreaks suggest coronaviruses will
remain viruses of concern for global health.
Many risk factors and comorbidities, including age, sex, hypertension, diabetes,
and obesity, can influence COVID-19 patient outcomes (3). Analysis of patient immune
parameters has linked disease severity to elevated levels of biomarkers for inflammation
(c-reactive protein and cardiac troponin I), organ damage (aspartate aminotransferase,
abbreviated AST, and hypoalbuminemia), immune hyperactivity (IL-6 and IL-10), and
clotting (D-dimer) (4). Mortality in COVID-19 is often caused by multi-organ injury and
severe pneumonia attributed to an excessive immune response, termed a cytokine storm
(5). Given the rapid and wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease progression, a more precise
prognostic linking disease risk factors and specific immune responses can potentially
predict disease trajectories and guide interventions.
One hypothesis to explain differences in severity of COVID-19 implicates weakly
binding, non-neutralizing antibodies (Abs) to SARS-CoV-2 proteins (6). However, the
potential harm of these suboptimal Abs in COVID-19 patient outcomes remains illdefined. Furthermore, a recent review on antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-

CoV-2 stated, “At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or
biomarkers that can differentiate any severe infection from immune-enhanced disease,
whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses (7)." This conclusion
inspired our study.
SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins – spike (S), nucleocapsid (N),
membrane (M), and envelope (E). The S, N, and M proteins from SARS elicit an Ab-based
immune response (8, 9). The Ab response and its effects on disease progression in
SARS-CoV-2 remain under investigation (10, 11). Bioinformatics has predicted >55 Ab
binding epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 (12–17). The epitopes for N, M or E proteins are less
well-characterized than for S protein. Several studies have reported comprehensive
epitope mapping of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (18–20). Here, we sought to
characterize epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 and their correlations with disease severity.
ELISAs with phage-displayed epitopes (phage ELISAs) and coronavirus antigen
microarray (COVAM) analysis (21) examined plasma samples from COVID-19 patients
(n = 86). The results demonstrate that Abs to a specific epitope from N protein plus
disease risk factors strongly correlate with COVID-19 disease severity.

Results
Design and production of candidate epitopes
Twenty-one putative SARS-CoV-2 epitopes were predicted through bioinformatics
(12–14) and structure-based analysis. The candidate epitopes span the S, N, M, or E
proteins and are on average 34 amino acids in length (Fig. 1 and Table S1). The structure
of S protein bound to a neutralizing antibody (22, 23) provided the starting point for 12 of

these antibody epitopes. Epitopes were designed to potentially isolate even suboptimal
Abs binding to small portions of these structural proteins; such suboptimal Abs were
hypothesized to provide insight into disease severity. After display of each potential
epitope on the surface of phage, the quality of the epitopes was evaluated by PCR, DNA
sequencing, and QC ELISA (Fig. S1). A total of 18 phage-displayed, putative epitopes
passed quality control, and were selected for further study.

(colored). These epitopes were phage-displayed as fragments of the full-length protein
and were likely unstructured. The depicted structural models were derived from an S
protein X-ray structure (PDB: 6VXX) (22) or computation modeling of N, M, and E proteins
(Protein Gene Bank: QHD43423, QHD43419, and QHD43418, respectively) (24). Table

Mapping epitope binding to anti-SARS-CoV-2 Abs
Plasma from COVID-19 patients was subjected to ELISAs with the phagedisplayed SARS-CoV-2 epitopes (Fig. 2A). Unless otherwise indicated (e.g., healthy
controls), plasma refers to samples from PCR-verified, COVID-19 patients. In this initial
assay, plasma was pooled, diluted 100-fold, and coated on a microtiter plate (3 pools of
n = 5 patients per pool). Nonspecific interactions were blocked (ChonBlock), and phage5

displayed epitopes were added for ELISA. The resultant data were normalized by signal
from the corresponding negative control (phage without a displayed epitope). Seven
promising epitopes from the pooled patients were further investigated with a larger
number of individual patient samples (n = 28) (Fig. 2B). The strongest binding was
observed for three epitopes from M (Ep6), N (Ep9), and S (Ep20) proteins. Additional
COVID-19 plasma samples were profiled for binding to these three epitopes (n = 86 total)
(Fig. 2B).
The Ep9 epitope from N protein demonstrated robust antibody binding in 27% of
the patient plasmas (n = 86). The other epitopes failed to produce statistically sufficient
numbers of responses. Levels of anti-Ep9 Abs (αEp9 Abs) were mapped over 43 days.
The highest levels of αEp9 Abs were observed at days 1 to 14 post-symptom onset (n =
11) and were detectable within 6 days (Fig. 2C).

The epitopes with the highest signals were then further examined by ELISA with plasma
from individual patients (n as indicated). C) With samples from individual patients
(designated as P# and by color) collected at the indicated times, αEp9 Abs were
measured. D) Ep9 orthologs from SARS, MERS, HKU-1, or NL63 (x-axis) examined the
cross-reactivity of Abs to Ep9 (3 technical replicates). Error bars represent SEM (panels
A, B, and D) or range of two measurements (panel C).
Cross-reactivity of αEp9 Abs against orthologous epitopes from other coronaviruses
Next, the cross-reactivity of αEp9 Abs was examined with Ep9-orthologs from four
phylogenetically related coronaviruses known to infect humans (Fig. S2A). Specifically,
plasma with αEp9 Abs (n = 3) and pooled plasma from healthy individuals (n = 5) were
assayed. The Ep9 epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS have 90% amino acid
sequence homology. Unsurprisingly, this high degree of similarity resulted in a crossreactive Ep9 epitope, and a strong antibody response was observed to Ep9 epitopes from
both viruses (Fig. 2D). The coronaviruses, MERS, HKU-1, and NL63 have 52%, 43%,
and 8% sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2 Ep9, respectively (Fig. S2B). These more
distantly related orthologs exhibited no cross-reactivity with the αEp9 Abs. Furthermore,
no response was observed to Ep9 in pooled plasma from healthy individuals.
COVAM analysis tests cross-reactivity with a panel of 61 antigens from 23 strains
of 10 respiratory tract infection-causing viruses. In this assay, each antigen was printed
onto microarrays, probed with human sera or plasma, and analyzed as previously
described. COVAM distinguishes between IgG and IgM Abs binding to the full-length N
protein (Fig. S3 and S4, respectively). The ELISA and COVAM data both demonstrate
that αEp9 Abs are highly specific for lineage B betacoronaviruses, and unlikely to be
found in patients before their infection with SARS-CoV-2.

More severe disease and poorer outcomes for αEp9 patients
Direct comparison of data with full-length N protein from COVAM and Ep9 phage
ELISA (n = 40 patients assayed with both techniques) reveals five unique categories of
patients (Fig. 3A). To enable this comparison, raw data from each assay was normalized
as a percentage of the negative control. Category 1 consists of patients without Abs to
the N protein. The next categories include patients with IgMs (Category 2) or IgGs
(Category 3) binding to N protein, but not Ep9, termed non-Ep9 αN Abs. Category 4
includes patients with αEp9 Abs (both IgMs and IgGs). Category 5 patients have
exclusively IgG αEp9 Abs. The αEp9 Abs are only found in patients with IgMs or IgGs
against full-length N protein from the COVAM assay; the COVAM analysis thus
independently corroborate the phage ELISAs (Fig. 3A).
Interestingly, the patients with αEp9 Abs suffer more prolonged illness and worse
clinical outcomes compared to patients with non-Ep9 αN Abs or no αN Abs. In this study,
severe COVID-19 cases are defined as resulting in death or requiring admission to the
ICU or intubation. The fraction of severe COVID-19 cases was 2.5 times higher in αEp9
Abs patients than non-Ep9 αN Abs patients (Fig. 3B, yellow panel); the differences in
proportions of severe and non-severe αN-positive patients with or without αEp9 Abs are
statistically significant (p<0.030, Fisher’s exact test). Patients without αN Abs (Category
1) had less severe symptoms. The αEp9 Abs patients also had longer durations of
symptoms and hospital stays relative to non-Ep9 αN Abs and no αN Abs patients (Figs.
3C and D). A larger data set of patient plasma analyzed by phage ELISA confirmed this
conclusion (p<0.0013, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 3B, blue panel). Our data further
demonstrates that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (n = 3) also tested negative for αEp9

Abs (Table S2). The data also reveals early seroconversion of αEp9 IgGs (Fig. 3E), but
not αEp9 IgMs (Fig. 3F).

calculations for panels C and D. E) The αN IgG appear at high levels early in the course

Strong correlation between disease severity and comorbidities in patients with αEp9 Abs
We compared risk factors, clinical parameters, and disease outcomes among
patients with αEp9 Abs (n = 23) (Figs. 4A and S5). A disease risk factor score (DRFS)
was developed to evaluate the relationship between clinical preconditions and disease

severity in patients with αEp9 Abs. The DRFS quantifies a patient’s age, sex, and preexisting health conditions associated with COVID-19 disease severity and mortality. Risk
factors include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and chronic conditions of the
following: cardiac, cerebrovascular, kidney, and pulmonary (25–28). Using the age score
from the Charlson Comorbidity Index (29) yields a patient’s DRFS as:
DRFS = Σ (# of risk factors) + (age score)
where each risk factor is valued as either 0 or 1 if absent or present, respectively. The
DRFS of patients with αEp9 Abs strongly correlates with COVID-19 disease severity
(Pearson’s r = 0.72, p-value <0.0001, and R2= 0.52) (Fig. 4A). The correlation in patients
without αEp9 Abs is weak (r = 0.30, p-value = 0.089, R2= 0.018) (Fig. 4A). Amongst
patients with αEp9 Abs (n = 23), a DRFS ≥3 can determine disease severity with 92.3%
sensitivity (1/13 false negatives) and 80% specificity (2/10 false positives) (Fig. 4B). In
the entire study cohort (n = 86), patients with αEp9 Abs and DRFS ≥3 (n = 11) have
severe disease with a high degree of specificity (96.72%) and a sensitivity of 44%.
Notably, DRFS predicts disease severity only for patients with αEp9 Abs (n = 23), and
patients without such Abs (n = 63) had no correlation with disease outcomes.
Examining key contributors to high DRFS, the presence of αEp9 Abs correlates
with more severe disease in patients who have hypertension, diabetes, or age >50 years.
Such correlation is not observed for patients lacking αEp9 Abs (Figs. 4C). Such risk
factors are prevalent at roughly the same percentages in both populations of patients
(Table S2). Thus, these risk factors are particularly acute for patients with αEp9 Abs.

(30–32). For patients with IL-6 concentrations measured in plasma, patients with (n = 8)
or without (n = 11) αEp9 Abs were compared. Interestingly, the comparison uncovered a
strong positive sigmoidal association between IL-6 and AST unique to patients with αEp9
Abs (R2 = 0.968, Spearman’s r = 1.0, p-value <0.0001, n = 8) (Blue line, Fig. S6A);
correlation of IL-6 and AST in patients with αEp9 Abs remains strong even after removal
of the data point at the highest IL-6 concentration. Conversely, a slight negative trend is
observed in patients lacking αEp9 Abs (Spearman’s r = -0.575, p-value= 0.0612, n = 13).
Thus, the presence of αEp9 Abs can disambiguate the sometimes contradictory
association of IL-6 with disease severity.

Discussion
This study introduces a two-step test as a prognostic for predicting COVID-19
disease severity and its worst outcomes. Specifically, αEp9 Abs can effectively predict
severe disease (specificity 83.6%). However, combining presence of αEp9 Abs with
DRFS ≥3 provides much higher specificity (96.72%) for predicting severe disease.
Previously, αN IgGs have been recognized as a focal site for an antibody response (18,
19, 33) and associated with disease severity and poor outcomes (11, 33, 34). The results
of our study of αEp9 Abs independently confirm exciting observations from a patient
cohort in Singapore, which focused on its use in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection (20).
The present investigation expands on previous reports. Experimental differences
include in-depth patient clinical histories, test results, and disease outcomes ranging from
asymptomatic to fatal. Such data allows calculation of the DRFS. Together with the
presence of αEp9 Abs, patient DRFS allows early discrimination of severe from non-

severe disease outcomes. Additionally, fine epitope mapping demonstrates that αEp9
Abs strongly and uniquely correlate with COVID-19 disease severity relative to other αN
Abs.
We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism relating αEp9 Abs to increased
disease severity involves an overzealous immune response. Specifically, we observe
early seroconversion and strong early upregulation of αEp9 IgGs (Fig. 3E). Similar IgG
observations have been correlated with poor viral neutralization and clearance, resulting
in increased COVID-19 severity (10, 34, 35). Also high levels of IL-6 are observed for
αEp9-positive patients with increased levels of the tissue damage marker AST; this
correlation does not exist for patients lacking αEp9 Abs (Fig. S6A). The sensitivity to IL6 concentration before AST-monitored organ damage suggests anti-IL-6 therapeutics
could be an effective management for αEp9-positive patients (30, 36–38). Further
investigation is required to determine the basis for increased disease severity in αEp9
patients.
The data demonstrate that αEp9 positive patients with DRFS ≥3 are 13.42 times
(Likelihood Ratio) more likely to have severe COVID-19 disease symptoms within the
study cohort (n = 86). The presence of αEp9 without DRFS is less effective as a
prognostic (Likelihood Ratio of 3.17). Despite its high specificity (96.7%), the sensitivity
of this two-step test is 44% (n = 86). However, this test could predict a subset of patients
with a specific immune response (i.e., early IgG response and IL-6 dependent immune
hyperactivity), and could suggest targeted treatment options (e.g., targeting IL-6 and its
pathways).

Importantly, αEp9 Abs appear early in the course of disease. Thus, such a
prognostic could outperform traditional markers for the cytokine storm such as IL-6, which
appears 6-8 days after symptom onset (30, 38); all plasma collected from αEp9 positive
patients (n = 7, Fig 2C) between 1 to 6 days post-symptoms onset demonstrate
detectable levels of αEp9 IgG (≥ 2 fold over negative control). Early detection of αEp9
Abs in patients could be used to triage and treat COVID-19 prior to the onset of its most
severe symptoms after which drugs can lose efficacy (30, 36–38) (Fig. S6B).
This study demonstrates the usefulness of fine epitope mapping, but the following
limitations should be noted. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation were
omitted for the phage-displayed S protein epitopes; COVAM antigens, however, are
produced in baculovirus or HEK-293 cells, which could include glycans. Our analysis is
based upon a population of 86 COVID-19 patients and 5 healthy individuals, with the
majority of Hispanic descent. The conclusions could be further strengthened with followup investigations in a larger population. Additionally, the population examined here only
included three asymptomatic individuals, and additional testing is required to verify
absence of αEp9 Abs in such patients. The sample size of patients with multiple antibody
targets was too limited to allow correlation analysis; future investigations could examine
associations between αEp9 and other Abs. Abs recognizing other SARS-CoV-2 structural
proteins could also exhibit similar characteristics to αEp9 Abs.
Existing diagnostic platforms could readily be adapted to test for αEp9 Abs, and
the DRFS calculation is quite simple to implement. As shown here, αEp9 Abs do not
recognize orthologous sequences from closely related coronaviruses, providing good
specificity for αEp9 as a prognostic. Previous studies have shown that the high homology

of N protein among related coronaviruses can lead to high false positive rates in
serodiagnostics with full-length N antigen (39). Thus, the two-step prognostic reported
here could mitigate the worst outcomes of COVID-19, particularly for patients at high risk.
