ABSTRACT
Rationale: Several studies have estimated basic production number of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).
However, the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the outbreak remain unclear.
Objectives: We aimed to estimate the basic and time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP across China, and
compared them with SARS.
Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official
websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and Hong
Kong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and
time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS.
Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily
confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter
than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases
nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong
(R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after
January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values
were less than 1 during the epidemic.
Conclusions:
NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective.
However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.

At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Since December 29, 2019, pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV,
now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP), occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The
disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas. As a novel virus, the time-varying transmission
dynamics of NCP remain unclear, and it is also important to compare it with SARS.
What This Study Adds to the Field: We compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS, and

found that NCP has a higher transmissibility than SARS. Time-varying production number indicates
that rigorous control measures taken by governments are effective across China, and persistent efforts
are needed to be taken for reducing instantaneous reproduction number below one.

Introduction
Eighteen years ago, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out globally, which
caused more than 8000 cases with a fatality rate of 9.6% (1). Since December 2019, a
pneumonia infection with 2019-nCoV, which was now named as Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia
(NCP), broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread throughout China and
to many other countries (2-4). As of February 9, 2020, 2019-nCoV had transmitted to 34
provinces, regions and municipal cities across China. A total of 40,235 confirmed NCP cases
with 908 deaths (2.3%) and 6,484 (16.1%) critically ill cases, and there were still 23,589
suspected cases (5).
As an emerging infectious disease, we need to quickly understand its etiological,
epidemiological and clinical characteristics to take prevention and control measures. Several
studies have described the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCP, and have
demonstrated that it can transmitted between humans (4, 6). A few studies have also estimated
the basic reproduction number (R0) of NCP (6-11). For instance, Li et al. computed the R0 of
2.2 using daily NCP data before January 4 in Wuhan. Our study using early epidemic stage data
also found reproductive number of NCP was 2.9 (11). However, most of these studies employed
daily reporting cases at very early epidemic stage or were purely based on mathematical
modeling. It has been suggested that epidemic size may be seriously under-reported due to the
unknown etiology and lack of diagnosis protocol at early epidemic stage(12), which may lead
to underestimation of R0. In addition, for control measures to be optimized during ongoing NCP
epidemics, temporal changes in reproduction number must be tracked. However, none of
previous studies have estimated time-varying instantaneous reproduction number (Rt), which is

an important parameter for assessing whether the control and prevention measures are effective
or whether additional measures are needed (13). Moreover, excerpt for Hubei Province, most
of confirmed cases reporting from other provinces were imported from Hubei Province at early
epidemic stage. With increasing secondary cases in those provinces, however, it is unknown
how much the Rt for secondary cases is in those Provinces. Knowing this information is very
helpful to assess the epidemic trend and the effects of control measures in those provinces.
As a milestone of global public health events, the transmission dynamics of SARS have been
well studied (14, 15). Comparing the transmissibility of NCP with SRAS could imply decision
making on the prevention and control of NCP. Therefore, in this study, we described the
epidemiological characteristics of NCP using the latest data across China, and estimated the
basic and time-varying reproduction numbers which were compared with SARS. Our findings
are critical to optimize prevention and control measures during the ongoing epidemic of NCP,
as well as guide clinical management.

Methods
Data Collection
Daily number of confirmed NCP cases across China and in other countries were collected as of
February 7, 2020. Confirmed NCP case was defined based on the Diagnosis and Treatment
Scheme of NCP released by the National Health Commission of China (Section 1.1 in
Supplementary materials) (16). For cases in Guangdong Province, China, individual data
including date of onset, hospitalization and diagnosis were obtained from medical records and
epidemiological investigations. We collected daily number of reported cases in other provinces
of China or other countries from official websites.
We obtained daily number of SARS cases during 2002-2003 in Guangdong Province from
Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (GDCDC). In addition, daily
number of SARS cases in Beijing (from March 5 to May 29, 2003) and Hong Kong (from
February 15 to May 31, 2003) were obtained from Pang et al.’s report (17) and WHO website
(18), respectively.
Estimating and nowcasting the daily incidence of NCP
Because only the daily number of reporting cases were obtained from regions out of Guangdong
Province, we estimated the daily number of incidences using a generalized additive model
(GAM) (Section 1.2 in Supplementary materials). First, we collected each individual onset date
and reporting date in Guangdong province which was treated as a sample of all confirmed cases
nationwide. Second, a GAM model was used to establish the relationship between onset date
and reporting date, and obtained the lagged probability distribution of daily number of
incidences for the number of reporting cases. Third, we used the lagged probability distribution

to predict the daily number of incidences based on the daily number of reporting cases in other
provinces of China, which was added up to obtain the daily incidences nationwide. In order to
test the validity of this approach, we randomly divided all cases in Guangdong into two groups
(group A and B). Cases in group A was used to establish a GAM model, which was then used
to predict the number of incidences in group B. We then estimated the correlation between the
actual incidence and the estimated incidence, and the results of cross-validation showed that
the R2 was 89.7%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 4.11 (Figure S1).
The number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases were further estimated during the study
period, which caused by reporting delays. Reasons for such delays include the time to complete
diagnosis test, logistics, and overwhelmed surveillance systems. To minimize the effects of
reporting delay, we applied a Bayesian nowcasting model (Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing)
to complement the daily total number of incidences (19). This model is characterized by its
ability to deal with the uncertainty in the delay distribution and the time evolution of epidemic
curve.
Estimation of the reproduction number
Basic reproduction number (R0)
In the early phase of an infectious disease outbreak, the initial reproductive rate approximated
an exponential growth rate (20). We selected a period of exponential growth in the epidemic
curve to calculated R0, which was defined as the expected number of secondary cases produced
by a typical primary case. Since the daily incidence data is an integer, Poisson regression was
used to fit the exponential growth rate. We used a prior Gamma distribution for the generation
time, with a shape parameter (mean generation time of 7.5 days) and a scale parameter (standard

deviation of 3.4 days) from a previous study (7). We estimated R0 of all confirmed NCP cases
nationwide and in Wuhan, and R0 of SARS cases in Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and
Beijing. We also estimated R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province.
Time-varying instantaneous reproduction number (Rt)
In contrast to R0, time-varying instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) represents the average
number of secondary cases that would be produced by a typical primary case infected at time t
if conditions remained constant after time t (13). We estimated Rt from the time series of onset
cases, with the same Gamma distribution of generation time as R0. In order to maintain the
accuracy of the prediction and without hiding the underlying time trend, Rt values were
estimated over a 10-day moving window. For the period of estimation, the end date was selected
as the latest date of the available data, and the starting date was selected as the earliest date for
which the 10-day instantaneous reproduction number estimated above could be assumed
constant. We estimated Rt for all confirmed NCP cases nationwide, and in Wuhan, and for
secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province.
Statistical analysis
We applied frequency and percentages (%) to describe categorical variables, and used mean±SD
to describe the continuous variables. The doubling time of NCP and SARS were defined and
estimated using a method proposed by Galvani et al (21).
Sensitivity analysis
A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to quantify the effect of parameters changes on
R0 value. We changed the shape parameter of Gamma distribution from 7.0 to 8.0 days for
estimating the R0 of NCP cases, and changed the same parameter from 8.0 to 9.0 for estimating

the R0 of SARS cases.

Results
Description of the outbreak
As of February 7, 2020, a total of 34,598 confirmed cases were identified in 34 provinces,
regions and municipal cities across China, and 270 confirmed cases were identified in other 24
countries (Figure 1A). Hubei Province reported the most cases (n=24,953), in which 13,603
(54.5%) cases were reported in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei. The fatality rate of NCP was
2.8% (699/24,953) in Hubei Province, and 0.24 % (23/9,645) in other provinces, China. A total
1,075 confirmed cases were reported in Guangdong Province, in which 220 (20.5%) cases were
secondary cases, 51 cases were identified with positive of 2019-nCoV but did not report any
symptoms, and 2 secondary cases were infected by sharing elevator with the index cases from
their neighbors (Figure 1B).
Figure 2 displays the epidemic trend of NCP nationwide, in Wuhan and in Guangdong Province.
Daily numbers of reporting cases continuously increased to the peak on February 4, 2020, and
slightly decreased then after nationwide and in Wuhan. The peak of daily reporting cases was
on January 31, 2020 in Guangdong Province, and then significantly decreased. The daily
incidence after nowcasting showed similar trend with the reporting data. The doubling time of
NCP was 2.4, 2.8, and 3.6 days nationwide, in Wuhan, and in Guangdong Province, respectively
(Table 1).
A total of 1,511, 1,734 and 2,521 SARS cases were reported in Guangdong Province, Hong
Kong and Beijing during 2002-2003. The peak of daily cases in the three regions were found
on February 8, March 25 and April 25, 2003 respectively (Figure S2). The doubling time of
SARS in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Beijing were 14.3, 5.7 and 12.4 days during the period

prior to the peak, respectively (Table 1).
Estimation of basic reproduction number (R0)
The R0 values of NCP were 4.5 (95%CI: 4.4-4.6) and 4.4 (95%CI: 4.3-4.6) nationwide and in
Wuhan, respectively. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province was 0.6 (95%CI:
0.4-0.7). The R0 values for SARS were 2.3 (95%CI: 2.0-2.7), 2.3 (95%CI: 2.0-2.5) and 2.6
(95%CI: 2.4-2.8) in Guangdong, Hong Kong and Beijing, respectively (Table 1).
Estimation of time-varying reproduction number (Rt)
During the epidemic, at national level, Rt values increased from 6.9 (95%CI: 5.5-8.4) before
January 9 to a peak of 8.8 (95%CI: 8.3-9.4) before January 16, and then continuously decreased
to 1.59 (95%CI: 1.57-1.61) before February 6. The Rt values in Wuhan continuously decreased
from 6.2 (95%CI: 4.9-7.6) by January 9 to 2.10 (95%CI: 2.07-2.14) before February 6. By
contrast, Rt values for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province was kept at a low-level
ranging from 0.8 (95%CI: 0.6-1.1) to 0.2 (95%CI: 0.2-0.3) during the epidemic (Figure 3).
Sensitivity analyses
The results of sensitivity analyses showed the R0 values of NCP and SARS were robust to the
changes of GT (Figure S3). For example, the R0 of NCP cases nationwide changed from 4.0
(95%CI: 3.9-4.1) using GT=7.0 to 4.9 (95%CI:4.8-5.1) using GT=8.0.

Discussion
The 2019-nCoV is a novel coronavirus, which is different from SARS and other SARS-like
viruses(3). However the time-varying transmission dynamics of NCP during the epidemic
remain unclear(22). In this study, we estimated the R0 of NCP infected with 2019-nCoV
nationwide, and found that the R0 was 4.5, which means an average of 4.5 secondary cases
generated by a primary case in the early stage. An approaching R0 of 4.4 was found in Wuhan.
Our estimated R0 was larger than that (R0=2.2) reported by Li et al. who employed the data in
Wuhan between December 10, 2019 and January 4, 2020, the very early stage of this epidemic
(7). It was debated that the number of NCP cases might be seriously underreported in the early
stage (10, 23), since 2019-nCoV was confirmed on January 7, and the official diagnosis protocol
was released by WHO until January 17 (12). In addition, the surveillance was not widely
conducted, and many infections may be missed. Read et al. estimated that only 5.1% of
infections in Wuhan were identified in the early period (23). Zhao et al. estimated that the R0 of
NCP was larger than 5.0 using national reported data from January 10 to January 24, 2020,
under the scenario that the reporting rate was not changed during that period(12).
Although the fatality rate of NCP cases was much lower than SARS(1), we observed higher R0
and much shorter doubling time of NCP than SARS (14, 24, 25), indicating the higher
transmissibility of 2019-nCoV. These differences can be due to two reasons. First,
epidemiological and clinical evidences suggest that asymptomatic or mild NCP cases during
their incubation periods could effectively transmit 2019-nCoV, which was different from SARS
because most SARS cases were infected by “super spreaders”, and SARS cases in incubation
period and mild cases could not infected susceptible (26). The average incubation period of

NCP was 4.8 days, ranging from 1 to 14 days, and the average period from onset to isolation
was 2.9 days (11), which indicates a long transmission period of NCP. Second, NCP epidemic
coincided with the approaching of Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, during which, under
normal circumstances, an estimated 3 billion trips would be made, and 15 million trips occurred
in Wuhan (27), which dramatically increased population mobility and accelerated the spread of
NCP. Although Wuhan prohibited all transport in and out of the city as of 10:00 on January 23
2020, millions of citizens have left Wuhan before that time, and they may have become the
major exporter of 2019-nCoV infection in other regions in China and other counties. Fortunately,
the intervention of travel restriction was effective in slowing the 2019-nCoV invasion of new
locations (28).
We observed significant decrease in the time-varying Rt values of NCP nationwide and in
Wuhan particularly after January 16. More importantly, the daily reporting cases began to
decline after February 4. These results indicate that the rigorous measures of prevention and
control taken by Chinese governments are taking into effect (Figure S4). For example,
following the Wuhan travel restriction, most provinces and cities also implemented travel
restriction, and conducted quarantine on all outpatients in fever, close contracts, and especially
in persons travelling from Hubei Province. The Chinese Lunar New Year holiday was extended,
and all gathering and public activities were restricted to prevent the transmission of 2019-nCoV.
More importantly, almost all provinces and regions in China have initiated the highest level of
public health emergency response. Risk communication and health education on NCP were
broadly conducted through various channels, which has improved the general public to
understand the risk of NCP, and take voluntary actions to detect, diagnose and treat cases

infected 2019-nCoV earlier. This can be verified by decreasing period from onset to diagnosis
during the epidemic in Guangdong Province (Figure S5).
We also observed that the R0 was less than 1, and the Rt values continuously declined after
January 23 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong Province, which demonstrates that the
implemented prevention and control measures have significantly reduced the risk of indigenous
outbreak of NCP, and that the increasing NCP cases were dominated by imported cases.
Meanwhile, we found that two secondary cases were infected through sharing the public
elevator with cases from their neighbors, which indicates the higher risk of transmission of NCP
in community. Similar cases were also reported in other regions. For example, Wang et al.
reported that 57 (including 40 healthcare workers and 17 patients) out of 138 hospitalized
patients were presumed to have been infected with 2019-nCoV in a Wuhan hospital (29).
Therefore, more efforts are needed to prevent the transmission in communities and other public
places.
This study has several strengths. First, this is the first study, to date, to assess the time-varying
transmission dynamics of NCP based on incidence data nationwide. We also estimated
instantaneous reproduction number for secondary cases in Guangdong Province. Secondly, we
compared the transmission dynamics of NCP with SARS using the same methods. Third, we
initially assessed the effects of control measures previously taken by the governments. These
findings could provide important information for optimizing control measures.
Our study has several limitations. First, the incidence date of confirmed cases in provinces
except for Guangdong Province were estimated by a GAM modeling, which may lead to
misclassification bias. However, the cross-validation test indicated a good performance of our
13

GAM modeling. In addition, the R0 (3.8, 95%CI: 3.4-4.2) estimated for imported cases in
Guangdong Province, as a sample of the total confirmed cases nationwide, was comparable
with the R0 estimated nationwide, indicating that our results are robust. Second, we are still in
the early stage of this outbreak, and there is much uncertainty in epidemiological parameters
that affects transmissibility of NCP. Sequential studies are urgently needed to fill-in these
knowledge gaps.
In summary, NCP may have a higher pandemic risk than SARS in 2003, and the efforts of
containing the outbreak are taking into effect. Our findings indicate that rigorous control and
prevention measures taken by Chinese governments on early detection, diagnosis and treatment
of NCP cases are still needed to uphold until the time-varying reproduction number below one.
