Receptor recognition and subsequent membrane fusion are essential for the

35

establishment of successful infection by SARS-CoV-2. Halting these steps can cure

36

COVID-19. Here we have identified and characterized a potent human monoclonal

37

antibody, HB27, that blocks SARS-CoV-2 attachment to its cellular receptor at sub-nM

38

concentrations. Remarkably, HB27 can also prevent SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion.

39

Consequently, a single dose of HB27 conferred effective protection against SARS-

40

CoV-2 in two established mouse models. Rhesus macaques showed no obvious adverse

41

events when administrated with 10-fold of effective dose of HB27. Cryo-EM studies

42

on complex of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S with HB27 Fab reveal that three Fab fragments

43

work synergistically to occlude SARS-CoV-2 from binding to ACE2 receptor. Binding

44

of the antibody also restrains any further conformational changes of the RBD, possibly

45

interfering with progression from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. These results

46

suggest that HB27 is a promising candidate for immuno-therapies against COVID-19.

disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

67

(SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of this pandemic continues to ravage the global

68

population, causing millions of infections. Losses in lives, declining wellbeing, and

69

disruption of economic activities as a result of the infections have strained societies and

70

significant impacted on people’s normal life. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the

71

betacoronavirus

72

alphacoronaviruses, endowed with an ability to infect humans (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et

73

al., 2020). Among these, infections caused by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and Middle

74

East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are known to culminate into

75

more severe clinical manifestations (Gao et al., 2020). To date, no specific drugs or

76

vaccines effective against these highly pathogenic coronaviruses have been approved.

77
78

Like, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes its protuberant S glycoprotein to engage with

79

its cellular receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for forging

80

membrane fusion in order to enter host cell (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Hoffmann

81

et al., 2020). Each monomeric S protein can be cleaved by host proteases, such as

82

TMPRSS2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020) into two functional domains, the

83

distal globular S1 domain and the membrane-proximal S2 domain, which mediate

84

receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively (Li, 2016). The S1 subunit consists

85

of an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal domain, which often functions as the

86

receptor binding domain (RBD). Conformational transitions are triggered upon release

87

of the S1 subunit after receptor binding and subsequent priming of the protein by host

88

cell proteases. These two key events advance the life-cycle of the virus from the

89

prefusion to the postfusion stage, leading to the fusion of the viral membrane with that

90

of the host cell (Li, 2016; Walls et al., 2017).

91
92

Such important roles played by S during viral infection make them valuable targets for

93

antibody-based drug and vaccine design (Pallesen et al., 2017). Previous structural

94

studies have revealed that the S trimer can switch between a receptor-accessible state

95

where one or more RBDs are in the open conformation and a receptor-inaccessible state

96

where all the RBDs are in the closed conformation. This switch is accomplished

through a hinge-like movement of the RBD, indicative of a dynamic and complicated

98

protein-protein interaction mode with host cells (Gui et al., 2017; Kirchdoerfer et al.,

99

2016; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020; Zhe Lv, 2020). Although numerous

100

neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting the RBDs of SARS-CoV or MERS have been

101

reported (Corti et al., 2015; Du et al., 2009; Walls et al., 2019), the immunogenic

102

features and key epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 remain poorly characterized. Recently, a

103

cross-binding mAb, CR3022, was demonstrated to neutralize SARS-CoV, but it failed

104

to efficiently prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting the challenges posed by

105

conformationally flexible virus-specific neutralizing epitopes in conferring protection

106

against infection (Yuan et al., 2020). More recently, a number of NAbs have been shown

107

to block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 and another RBD-targeting NAb, S309,

108

acted by inducing antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) which surprisingly did

109

not involve the blocking of virus-receptor interaction (Pinto et al., 2020; Wu et al.,

110

2020). This raises the possibility of existence of hitherto undiscovered neutralization

111

mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeting NAbs. A detailed understanding of the

112

mechanisms underlying the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to help provide new

113

guidance for the development of antiviral therapeutics and rational vaccine design.

Results

116

Phage display identifies a potent SARS-CoV-2 specific NAb

117

We previously identified a set of NAbs from an antibody library which was generated

118

from RNAs extracted from peripheral lymphocytes of mice immunized with

119

recombinant SARS-CoV RBD protein (Zhe Lv, 2020). In this study, we constructed

120

another antibody library by immunizing mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD,

121

which yielded a chimeric anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAb, named mhB27. mhB27 was able to

122

strongly bind to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and exhibited potent neutralizing activities against

123

SARS-CoV-2 when tested in a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyping system

124

(PSV) (Figure S1). A humanized antibody HB27 was generated based on the sequences

125

of mhB27. To investigate the viral specificity of HB27, we performed binding assays

126

measuring the ability of HB27 to bind the RBDs of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and

127

MERS-CoV. Analysis of the data obtained from real-time quantitation and kinetic

128

characterization of biomolecular interactions using OCTET system demonstrated that

129

both immunoglobulin G (Ig G) and Fab fragments of HB27 bind tightly to SARS-CoV-

130

2 RBD with affinities of 0.07 nM and 0.27 nM, respectively. However, this antibody

131

exhibits undetectable interactions with the RBDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,

132

suggesting that HB27 is SARS-CoV-2-specific (Figure 1A-1C). HB27 showed potent

133

neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC50)

134

value of 0.04 nM. Perhaps correlated with the inability to interact with SARS-CoV

135

RBD, HB27 possessed no inhibition activity against SARS-CoV in PSV-based

136

neutralization assays (Figure 1D-1E). Classical plaque reduction neutralization test

137

(PRNT) conducted against an authentic SARS-CoV-2 strain (BetaCoV/Beijing/IME-

138

BJ01/2020) further verified its neutralizing activity with a PRNT50 value of 0.22 nM

139

(Figure 1F).

140
141

Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of HB27 in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice

142

Given the excellent neutralizing activities at sub-nM concentrations, we next sought to

143

assess the correlation between in vitro neutralization and in vivo protection. The HB27

144

produced in the CHO cell line was first tested in a newly established mouse model

145

based on a SARS-CoV-2 mouse adapted strain MASCp6 (Gu et al., 2020). Upon

146

MASCp6 intranasal challenge, adult BALB/c sustained robust viral replication in the

147

lungs at 3-5 days post inoculation. To evaluate the protection efficacy of HB27, BALB/c

148

mice challenged with MAScp6 were administered a single dose of 20 mg/kg of HB27

149

in prophylactic as well as therapeutic settings (Figure 2A). As expected, high levels of

150

viral RNAs were detected in the lungs and trachea at 3 and 5 days post infection in the

151

control group of mice treated with PBS (Figure 2B-2C). Remarkably, a single dose of

152

HB27 administered either before or post SARS-CoV-2 exposure resulted in >99.9%

153

reduction of the viral RNA loads in the lungs and trachea (Figure 2B-2C).

154
155

Furthermore, we validated the in vivo protection efficacy of HB27 in a human ACE2

156

(hACE2) humanized mouse model that was susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Sun

157

et al., 2020). Similar to the studies with the MASCp6 strain of mice, either prophylactic

158

or therapeutic administration of HB27 conferred a clear benefit on the hACE2

159

humanized mouse model as indicated by a significant reduction in viral RNA loads in

160

the lungs and trachea at day 5 post SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Prophylactic administration

161

of HB27 showed a more potent antiviral effect, resulting in >1,000- fold reduction in

162

lung viral levels (Figure 2D-2E). A direct challenge via administration of excessive (up

163

to 5 × 105 PFU) SARS-CoV-2 through the intranasal route, where the IgG antibodies

164

may not be able to directly engage the target, could lead to virus particles gaining access

165

to the lung and trachea. Such experimental observations in the prophylactic and

166

therapeutic settings for many other protective human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

167

have been reported (Zhe Lv, 2020; Zost et al., 2020). However, it’s worthy to note that

168

no infectious virions could be detected in the lung at day 3 and day 5 as measured by a

169

plaque assay of lung tissue homogenates (Figure 2F). These results suggest that the low

170

levels of viral RNA copies detected in the lung/trachea might be the remnants of the

171

viral genomes from the infection at the very early stage. Histopathological examination

172

revealed moderate interstitial pneumonia, characterized by inflammatory cell

173

infiltration, alveolar septal thickening and distinctive vascular system injury developed

174

in hACE2 humanized mice belonging to the PBS control group at day 5 (Figure 2G).

175

In contrast, the lungs in mice from the HB27 treated group only showed minimal or

176

very mild inflammatory cell infiltration, and no obvious lesions of alveolar epithelial

177

cells or focal hemorrhage (Figure 2G). Collectively, these results clearly demonstrated

178

the utility of HB27 for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes against SARS-CoV-2.

179
180

Evaluation of the safety of administration of HB27 in non-human primates

181

As part of the non-clinical safety studies prior to the conduction of human clinical trials

182

for pharmaceuticals, we systematically evaluated the safety of administration of HB27

183

in rhesus macaques. Two groups of 4 animals (n=4) were administered a single

184

intravenous high dose (500 mg/kg, 10-fold of estimated effective dose in human) of

185

HB27 or placebo. HB27 serum concentrations, clinical observations and biological

186

indices were monitored closely for 16 days (Figure 3). Neither fever nor weight loss

187

was observed in any macaque after the infusion of HB27, and the appetite and mental

188

state of all animals remained normal. The toxicokinetics of HB27 in rhesus macaques

189

was evaluated by measuring HB27 levels in serum pre-infusion and at indicated time

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.393629; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

190

intervals after administration. A mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) of 12.8

191

mg/mL (± 0.8) of HB27 could be achieved and the average half-life of the antibody was

192

10.0 days (± 2.2) (Figure 3A and Table S1). Notably, prophylactic and therapeutic

193

efficacy of HB27 in animal models revealed that >99.9% of the viral RNA loads in the

194

lungs and trachea could be reduced at 5 days post infection (Figure 2), suggesting that

195

a half-life of 10 days for HB27 is probably sufficient for deriving therapeutic benefit.

196

Details of the results of the measurements of toxicokinetic parameters are presented in

197

Table S1. These results suggest that HB27 probably has pharmacokinetic properties

198

consistent with a typical human IgG1. Hematological and biochemical analysis,

199

including biochemical blood tests and lymphocyte subset percent (CD4+ and CD8+)

200

showed no notable changes in the HB27 administrated group when compared to the

201

placebo group (Figure 3B-3D). Taken together, the results of our animal studies indicate

202

that HB27 is generally safe in non-human primates.

203
204

HB27 prevents the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells by blocking its binding

205

to ACE2

206

To evaluate the ability of HB27 to inhibit binding of RBD to ACE2, we performed

207

competitive binding assays at both protein and cellular levels. Results of the enzyme-

208

linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that HB27 could prevent the binding of

209

soluble ACE2 (monomer in solution) to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with an EC50 value of 0.5

210

nM (Figure S2A). To verify the ability of HB27 to block the binding of ACE2 to

211

trimeric S, we expressed and purified stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer.

212

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays indicated that HB27 interacts with SARS-

213

CoV-2 S trimer with a slightly stronger binding affinity (~0.04 nM) (Figure S2B), which

214

was about 1000-fold higher than that of soluble ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure

215

S2C) (Shang et al., 2020). For the competitive SPR, two sets of assays: exposing the

216

trimeric S to HB27 first and then to soluble ACE2, or the other way around, were

217

conducted. As expected, binding of HB27 completely blocked the interaction between

218

soluble ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S. Moreover, soluble ACE2 that had already

219

bound to trimeric S could be replaced by HB27 because of the ~1000-fold difference in

220

binding affinities of these ligands to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S (Figure 4A). Cell-

221

based immunofluorescent blocking assays demonstrated that HB27 could block both

222

the binding of soluble ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S expressing 293T cells and the

223

attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 expressing 293T cells in a dose dependent

224

manner albeit with relative high EC50 values of about 5-50 nM (Figure 4B and Figure

225

S2D). Overexpression of ACE2/ S trimer on the 293T cell surface and the presence of

226

the dimeric form of ACE2 on cell surface are probably the reasons for the substantially

227

higher concentration of HB27 needed to prevent attachment of the virus to the cell

228

surface. To further verify these results in cell-based viral infection model, we used real-

229

time reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT–PCR) to quantify the amount of virus remaining

230

on the surface of cells that were treated with HB27 pre- and post-viral attachment at

231

4 °C. In line with the results of the competitive binding assays, HB27 efficiently

232

prevented SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cell surface at sub-nM and could displace

233

the virions that had already bound to the cell surface at ~2.5 nM (Figure 4C).

234
235

HB27 prevents SARS-CoV-2 membrane fusion

236

A common way to determine whether the antibody inhibits virus-receptor binding or a

237

post-attachment step of the infection is to compare neutralization curves deduced from

238

mixing antibody with the virus before or after binding to cells at 4 °C. The assumption

239

is antibodies that inhibit receptor binding will not have a neutralizing effect on virus

240

that has already bound to its receptor. However, this assumption may not be true,

241

because high-affinity antibodies could possibly displace the virus that is already

242

complexed to a low-affinity receptor, as observed for HB27 (Fig. 4B-4C). Thus,

243

deriving the mechanism of neutralization by just conducting neutralization assays may

244

not yield the complete picture, although pre- and post-attachment neutralization assays

245

suggested that HB27 inhibits a post-attachment step of the infection (Figure 5A). In

246

coronaviruses, receptor binding and proteolytic processing act in synergy to trigger a

247

series of conformational changes in S, bringing viral and cellular membranes in

248

proximity for fusion, leading to establishment of infection (Walls et al., 2017).

249

TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage is capable of activating the fusion potential of

250

coronavirus S proteins, inducing receptor-dependent syncytium formation, which was

251

recently observed in natural SARS-CoV-2 infections as well (Ou et al., 2020; Xia et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.24.393629; this version posted November 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this

252

2020). To explore whether HB27 could interfere with syncytium formation, we

253

established the S-mediated cell-cell fusion system using 293T cells that express SARS-

254

CoV-2 S with a GFP tag as the effector cells and Vero-E6 cells as the target cells (Figure

255

5B). After co-incubation of effector and target cells for 48 h, hundreds of cells fused

256

together into one large syncytium with multiple nuclei (Figure 5B). Remarkably, HB27

257

could completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion at the concentration of

258

0.5 μM. Notably, this result is comparable with the inhibition efficiencies of some pan-

259

coronavirus fusion inhibitors (Figure 5B) (Xia et al., 2020). Neither SARS-CoV-2

260

RBD-targeting neutralizing antibody, H014 nor the isotype control antibody (anti-

261

H7N9) could prevent membrane fusion under similar conditions (Figure 5B).

262

Furthermore, we performed live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay in a post-binding

263

manner in Huh7 cells. Briefly, Huh7 cells were infected with 100 PFU of SARS-CoV-

264

2 for 1 h at 4 ℃. Unbound viral particles were washed away using buffer. After that

265

cells were further cultured in the presence of a series of concentrations (0, 4, 20 and

266

100 nM) of HB27, or 100 nM of H014 at 37 ℃ for 48 h. Similar to S-mediated cell-

267

cell fusion, the large syncytiums formed by live SARS-CoV-2 infected Huh7 cells were

268

observed in the absence of HB27 and the presence of 100 nM H014 (Figure 5C).

269

Expectedly, HB27 could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mediated formation of the

270

syncytiums in a dose dependent fashion and completely block the cell-cell fusion at 100

271

nM (Figure 5C). Notably, such inhibition, to some extent, can possibly be attributed to

272

the ability of HB27 to strip SARS-CoV-2 off the cell surface. To further characterize

273

the molecular basis for fusion inhibition by HB27, we established an in vitro membrane

274

fusion assay that treatments of purified SARS-CoV-2 virions by trypsin and ACE2

275

could trigger viral membrane fusion with liposome at acidic environment. Liposome

276

fusion results show that HB27, but not H014, is capable of efficiently blocking pH-

277

dependent fusion of SARS-CoV-2 with liposomes in a dose dependent manner (Figure

278

5D). The blockage of membrane fusion by HB27 is likely another important mechanism

279

of neutralization. However, given the relatively higher concentration of HB27 needed

280

to block viral membrane fusion, blocking viral attachment to its host cell receptor is

281

likely to be the main mechanism of neutralization.

283

Structural basis for the SARS-CoV-2 specific binding of HB27

284

To delineate the structural basis for HB27-mediated specific neutralization, we

285

determined the cryo-EM structure of a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain

286

trimer in complex with the HB27 Fab fragment using single particle reconstruction.

287

Similar to previously published studies on apo SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, two distinct

288

conformational states referred to as the “close” and “open” RBDs were observed in the

289

structure of the complex (Figure 6A). Cryo-EM characterization of the complex showed

290

full occupancy with one Fab bound to each RBD of the homotrimeric S. We

291

asymmetrically reconstructed the complex structure at an overall resolution of 3.5 Å,

292

which represents two “open” and one “close” RBDs (Figure 6A, Figure S3-S4 and

293

Table S2). The initial maps for the binding interface between RBD and HB27 were

294

relatively weak due to conformational heterogeneity, which is in line with the structural

295

observations of stochastic RBD rotations at different angles while switching from the

296

“closed” to “open” states (Figure 6B-6C). In order to improve the local resolution, we

297

employed a “block-based” reconstruction approach, which resulted in a 3.9 Å resolution,

298

enabling reliable analysis of the interaction interface (Figure S3-S4).

299
300

HB27 binds to the apical head of RBD, partially overlapping with the edge of the RBM

301

core. This binding was independent of glycan recognition (Figure 6D-6E). The head of

302

RBD inserts into the cavity constructed by five complementarity determining regions

303

(CDRs, CDRL1, CDRL3 and CDRH1-3), involving extensive hydrophobic interactions

304

(Figure 6F). The heavy and light chains bury ~500 Å2 and ~210 Å2 of the surface area

305

of the epitope, respectively. Tight binding is further facilitated by 5 hydrogen bonds

306

(Figure 6G and Table S3). HB27 epitope includes 12 residues, of which only 7 residues

307

are conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, explaining its specificity for

308

SARS-CoV-2 for binding and neutralization (Figure S5A). Although a number of point

309

mutations in the RBD have been reported in currently circulating strains, none of these

310

mutations lie within the HB27 epitope (Figure S5A). To test the spectrum of

311

neutralizing activities of HB27 against currently circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2,

312

RBD mutants bearing various amino acid substitutions reported were expressed and

313

evaluated for their binding affinities to HB27. In line with structural analysis, all the

314

RBD mutants exhibited comparable binding abilities (Figure S5B). More recently,

315

SARS-CoV-2 isolates encoding a D614G mutation in the C-terminal region of the S1

316

predominate (Korber et al.). To investigate the neutralizing activities against this more

317

contagious isolate, SARS-CoV-2 PSV harboring the D614G mutation was constructed.

318

Compared to the wild type, HB27 showed similar binding affinities and neutralizing

319

activities against the D614G mutant (Figure S6), indicating that HB27 possibly exhibits

320

broad neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 strains currently circulating

321

worldwide.

322
323

Structural dissection of the mechanism of neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by HB27

324

Results of our functional studies revealed that HB27 could completely block the

325

interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 (Figure 4). To decipher the structural basis for

326

this ability of HB27, the complex structures of SARS-CoV-2 trimer/HB27-Fab and

327

SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 were superimposed. The superimposition of the structures

328

revealed that HB27 could sterically hinder ACE2 binding (Figure 7A). Out of the 12

329

residues in the HB27 epitope, 7 residues are involved in tight contacts with ACE2

330

(Figure 6E and Figure S7). In addition, the three HB27 Fabs act in synergy to abolish

331

ACE2 binding, in which binding of any one ACE2 molecule is sterically hindered by

332

two adjacent HB27 (Figure 7A). Unlike most structural studies of the apo SARS-CoV-

333

2 S trimer or complexes with a major configuration corresponding to one ‘open’ RBD

334

and the other two RBDs in ‘closed’ states (Walls et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2019; Wrapp

335

et al., 2020; Zhe Lv, 2020), only one conformational state with one ‘closed’ RBD (mol

336

A) and two ‘open’ RBDs (mol B and C) was observed in our complex structure.

337

Interestingly, Fab-A that binds the closed RBD lies between two open RBDs, forming

338

contacts with the mol B-RBD and the Fab-C located in proximity to the mol C-RBD

339

(Figure 7B). Probably acting as a bridge, the Fab-A, to some extent, anchors links of

340

all three RBDs and restrains their conformational transitions (Figure 7B). Perhaps

341

correlated with this, HB27 possesses the ability to disrupt the membrane fusion event

342

through restraining the conformational changes playing out during the progression from

343

the prefusion to the postfusion state. Collectively these data suggest that HB27 might

344

prevent both the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells and viral fusion with

345

endosomal membrane. However, fusion blockade by HB27 might be dependent on the

346

uptakes of antibodies into the endosome.

347
348

Discussion

349

SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV, implying that both

350

these viral strains share a similar mechanism of establishing an infection, including

351

targeting a similar spectrum of host cells, employing a similar entry pathway and

352

hijacking the same cellular receptor (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Both

353

cross-reactive and virus-specific human NAbs have been identified, despite around 77%

354

of amino-acid sequence identity between the S of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

355

(Brouwer et al., 2020; Hansen et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020; Wec et al., 2020; Wu et

356

al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020; Zhe Lv, 2020). It is important to decipher the immunogenic

357

mechanism to discover patterns of different patches comprising different residues

358

eliciting cross-reactive or virus-specific NAbs with various neutralization mechanisms.

359

Currently, several cross-reactive mAbs, including CR3022, H014 and S309, screened

360

from convalescent SARS patients or via immunization using SARS-CoV RBD, show

361

distinct neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 (Pinto et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020;

362

Zhe Lv, 2020). Structural analysis reveals that all these mAbs recognize conserved

363

patches either distal from or proximal to the edge of the RBM, but not in the RBM.

364

Interestingly, the corresponding epitope in both open and closed RBDs is accessible to

365

S309, but accessible to H014 only in open RBDs, and can only be accessed by CR3022

366

when at least two RBDs are in the open conformation. The stoichiometric binding of

367

Fab to the S trimer might correlate with the neutralizing activities, probably explaining

368

the weak neutralization efficiency observed for CR3022. HB27 targets the less

369

conserved edge of the RBM core with a full occupancy for all RBDs. This structural

370

observation supports the observed specificity of HB27 for SARS-CoV-2 and its highly

371

potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

372
373

Our results indicate that HB27 probably inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection at multiple

374

steps during the viral entry process. First, viral infection can be stalled by hindering the

375

attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to host cells by preventing interactions between the RBD

376

and ACE2, which is the major neutralization mechanism for most RBD-targeting NAbs.

377

Upon virus attachment and entry into host cells, proteolytic activation at the S1/S2

378

boundary leads to S1 dissociation and a dramatic structural change in S2, which triggers

379

viral membrane fusion (Shang et al., 2020). To date, antibodies that are capable of

380

interfering with coronavirus fusion have not been reported. HB27 may be involved in

381

restraining the conformational changes required for the progression of the life cycle of

382

the virus from the prefusion to the postfusion stage. Furthermore, recent studies suggest

383

that the SARS-CoV-2 entry depends on ACE2 and cell surface protease TMPRSS2

384

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020). A blockage of viral attachment to host cell

385

surface by HB27 possibly affects the colocalization of SARS-CoV-2 S with TMPRSS2

386

on the cell membrane. This may be yet another way employed by HB27 to prevent viral

387

membrane fusion where the cleavage of S by TMPRSS2 is averted. Therefore, the

388

potent neutralizing activity of HB27 probably results from its intervention at two steps

389

of viral infection, locking away attachment of the virus to its receptor and blocking

390

membrane fusion; resulting in a double lock.

391
392

Most importantly, the in vivo protection efficacy of HB27 was confirmed in two

393

established mouse models. The results of these studies consistently showed that a single

394

dose of HB27 either before or post SARS-CoV-2 exposure not only blocked viral

395

replication in the lungs and trachea, but also prevented the pulmonary pathological

396

damage. To date, only a few neutralizing antibodies have been tested in animal models

397

(Cao et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Previously, we have shown that H014 reduced

398

pulmonary viral loads by ~100-fold in human ACE2 mice (Zhe Lv, 2020). HB27

399

exhibits a more potent protective efficacy in reducing viral RNAs (~11,000-fold) with

400

a much lower administration dose (20 mg/kg v.s. 50 mg/kg). The preliminary results on

401

the efficacy of the antibody as well as the safety profile of HB27 in Rhesus macaques

402

support testing of its potential in curing COVID-19 in clinical trials. In fact, while this

403

manuscript was under review, HB27 entered clinical trials in China (registration

In summary, our results not only show how increasing access to panels of authentic

408

neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will facilitate structure-function studies to unpick

409

the underlying biological processes of virus-host interactions, but also provide

410

molecular basis for applying HB27 for potential COVID-19 treatment, highlighting the

promise of antibody-based therapeutic interventions.

667

of SARS-CoV RBD (residues 306–527, GenBank: NC_004718.3), SARS-CoV-2 RBD

668

(residues 319-541, GenBank: MN908947.3), and SARS-CoV-2 S trimer (residues 1–

669

1208, GenBank:MN908947.3), respectively, into the mammalian expression vector

670

pCAGGS with a C-terminal 2×StrepTag. Proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987,

671

a “GSAS” instead of “RRAR” at the furin cleavage site were performed on the gene

672

encoding S protein based on the research of Jason S. McLellan (Wrapp et al., 2020).

689

Generation of humanized anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody HB27

690

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were screened from a phage-display scFv library constructed

691

from the spleen mRNA of mice immunized with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD

692

protein. SARS-CoV-2 RBD was used as the bait to select for specific anti-RBD scFvs

693

by biopanning and the scFvs exhibiting potent binding for SARS-CoV-2 RBD were

694

generated as chimeric antibodies. The chimeric antibodies were expressed using HEK-

695

293T transient transfection production system and examined for competition activities

696

with ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizing activities against SARS-

697

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses. The chimeric antibody mhB27 exhibited high

698

binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potent neutralizing activity against SARS-

699

CoV-2 pseudoviruses, therefore its humanized version-HB27 (Fc modified IgG1

700

subtype) was further generated.

701

Generation of Fab fragment

702

The HB27 Fab fragment was prepared using Pierce FAB preparation Kit (Thermo

703

Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, following removal of the

704

salt with a desalting column, the antibody was mixed with papain and incubated for

705

digestion at 37 ˚C for 3-4 h. The HB27 Fab was separated using protein A affinity

706

column and concentrated for further applications.

707

Generation of mutant RBDs

708

Genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains were obtained from GISAID

709

(https://platform.gisaid.org), selected site mutants within the RBD domain (residues

710

306-527) were conducted. The mutated RBD genes with His-tag were cloned into

712

supernatants were collected and purified using IMAC resins.

713

Protein-protein interaction identified by Octet

714

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His was biotinylated and loaded onto SA sensor (Pall

715

corporation), and then HB27 antibody or HB27 Fab fragments were added for real-time

716

association and dissociation analysis using Octet96e (Fortebio). Data was processed

717

with Data Analysis Octet.

718

ELISA

719

The competition between HB27 and ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and the

720

binding of HB27 antibody to mutant SARS-CoV-2 RBDs are examined by ELISA.

721

Recombinant RBD protein was coated on 96-well plates using CBS buffer over night

722

at 4℃. The plates were blocked in BSA at room temperature for 1 h. Recombinant

723

ACE2 with an His-tag and serial diluted HB27 antibody were then added and incubated

724

at room temperature for 1 h. After washing away the unbound proteins and antibodies,

725

secondary antibody against His-tag with HRP labeling were added and incubated for 1

726

h before washed away. Developing buffer was added and incubated for 5-30 min, 1%

727

H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction and absorbance at 450 nm was detected with a

728

microplate reader. Recombinant RBD mutant proteins were coated on 96-well plates

729

using PBS buffer at 4 °C for 12 h. After that BSA solution was used for blocking at

730

25 °C for 1 h. Serial diluted antibodies were then added and incubated at room

731

temperature for 1 h. After washing away the unbound antibodies, secondary antibody

732

against human IgG with HRP labeled was added and incubated for 1 h before washed

733

away. For color development, TMB mixture solution was added and incubated for 5-30

734

min, then 1% H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction and absorbance at 450 nm was

735

detected with a microplate reader.

743

Production of pseudoviruses

744

Pseudoviruses were prepared as previously described (Nie et al., 2020). In brief, 293T

745

cells were transfected with the plasmids of SARS-CoV S or SARS-CoV-2 S,

746

respectively. 24 hours later, transfected 293T cells were infected with VSV G

747

pseudotyped virus (G*ΔG-VSV) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 4. Two hours

748

post infection, cells were washed three times using PBS, followed by adding complete

749

culture medium. Twenty-four hours post infection, SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2

750

pseudoviruses were harvested, 0.45-μm filtered and stored at −80 °C.

751

Pseudovirus neutralization assay

752

Aliquots of a 100 μL of ~40,000 Vero-E6 cells/well were added into 96-well plates. 60

753

μL of SARS-CoV/ SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses and 60 μL of serial diluted antibody

754

samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, after which the pseudovirus-mAb mixtures

755

were added into the wells containing Vero-E6 cells. The 96-well plates were then

756

incubated for 24 hours in a 5% CO2 environment at 37°C, then the luciferase

757

luminescence (RLU) was measured using luciferase assay system following the

758

manufacturer’s manual with a luminescence microplate reader. The neutralization

759

percentage was calculated by the formula: Inhibition (%) = [1- (sample RLU- Blank

760

RLU)/ (Positive Control RLU-Blank RLU)] (%). Neutralization titers of the antibodies

761

were presented as 50% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).

762

Immunofluorescence

763

293T cells were transfected with SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP or ACE2-GFP. 48h later, cells

764

were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature and

765

stained for nuclei with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). HB27 antibody was

766

incubated for 1h, followed by incubation of RBD-His and anti-His-PE，or APC labelled

767

ACE2-Fc for 20 min. The fluorescence images were recorded using a Nikon A1

ChemicalCo.) were mixed in a 84.5:15:0.5 molar ratio and prepared as previously

774

reported (Qiu et al., 2018). The dried lipid film was hydrated at room temperature with

775

100 mM calcein (Sigma) in buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, pH 7.4), and then

776

the vesicles were extruded 25 times using the Mini-Extruder device (Avanti Polar

777

Lipids) through Nuclepore filters (Whatman) with a pore size of 0.1 μm.

778

Unincorporated calcein was separated from the liposomes using a Sephadex G-50

779

column. Liposomes (10 mM lipid on the basis of the input lipid) were stored at 4°C and

780

used within 1 week.

781

Liposome-binding and Calcein-leakage assays

782

SARS-CoV-2 (~20 μg) was incubated with 0.1 μM trypsin (Sigma) at 37°C for 20 min.

783

Then the virus was mixed with 0.3 μM ACE2 and HB27 antibody with the final

784

concentration of 2.5 μM, 0.5 μM, 0.1 μM or 0.02 μM. The mixture was added to 0.1

785

mM liposomes in a total volume of 90 μl in a 96-well plate, and the fluorescence

786

(excitation at 460 nm, emission at 509 nm) was monitored at 37 °C using a SpectraMax

787

M5 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). At t = 0 sec, the pH of the medium were

788

adjusted to 5.6 by addition of 10 μl of 1 M MES (morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pH

789

5.6) as F0. The emission fluorescence was recorded as Ft at 10 sec intervals. After 500

790

sec, 10 μl of 10% Triton X-100 was added to achieve complete release of the maximum

791

fluorescence as F100. The fusion scale was calibrated such that 0% fusion corresponded

792

to the initial excimer fluorescence value. The percentage of calcein leakage at each time

793

point is defined as: leakage (%) = (Ft - F0) ×100 / (F100 - F0).

794

Cell–cell fusion assay

795

The establishment and detection of cell–cell fusion assay was performed as previously

796

described (Xia et al., 2020). In brief, Vero-E6 cells were used as target cells and 293T

797

cells transfected with SARS-CoV-2 S-GFP protein expression vectors were served as

798

effector cells. Effector cells and target cells were co-cultured in the absence or presence

799

of antibodies in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 48 h. After incubation, cells were

800

fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature for 20 min and stained for

801

nuclei with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The fluorescence images were

802

recorded using a Leica SpeII confocal microscope. S-mediated cell-cell fusion was

803

observed by the formation of multi-nucleated syncytia. Five fields were automatically

804

collected in each well to count the number of fused and unfused cells and the antibody

805

inhibition rate was calculated as following: fusion rate (FR) = (fused cell number) /

806

(fused cell number+ unfused cell number), Inhibition%= (Positive Control (FR) –

807

Sample (FR)) / (Positive Control (FR)) %. The experiment was performed three times.

808

Negative stain

809

Samples were diluted to a desired concentration (~0.02 mg/mL) and deposited onto

810

freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated grids. After rinsing twice with deionized water,

811

the grids were stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) and loaded onto a 120-

812

kV transmission electron microscope (FEI) for inspection.

813

Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection

814

HB27 Fab fragments and SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (1mg/ml) were purified and

815

incubated at a ratio of 9 Fab molecules per S trimer. 3μL aliquots of the mixture were

816

applied onto freshly glow-discharged C-flat R1.2/1.3 Cu grids. The grids were blotted

817

for 3 s in 100% relative humidity for plunge-freezing (Vitrobot; FEI) in liquid ethane.

818

The Cryo-EM data sets were collected at 300 kV with a Titan Krios microscope

819

(Thermo Fisher) fitted with a Gatan K2 detector. Movies (32 frames, each 0.2 s, total

820

dose 60 e−Å−2) were recorded at defocuses of between 1.25 and 2.7 μm using SerialEM,

821

yielding a final pixel size of 1.05 Å.

822

Image processing

823

Micrographs of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer-HB27 Fab complex were recorded. The defocus

824

values for each micrograph was determined using Gctf (Zhang, 2016). Then particles

825

were picked and extracted for 2D alignment and 3D classification by using the apo

826

structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer (Walls et al., 2020) as the initial model in Relion

827

(Scheres, 2016). The best classes were selected and used for 3D refinement and

828

postprocessing (estimate the B-factor automatically), yielding the final resolution of 3.5

829

Å based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (threshold = 0.143) (Scheres and

830

Chen, 2012). However, the densities for the binding interface between RBD and HB27

831

are weak due to the conformational heterogeneity of the RBD. To solve this problems,

832

we utilized the block-based reconstruction strategy (Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al.,

833

2019; Yang et al., 2020) for focusing classification and refinement. Details on parameter

834

settings can be found in structural determinations for the binding interface between

835

RBD and H014 (Zhe Lv, 2020). In addition, local averaging of the RBD-Fab equivalent

836

copies present in different classes further improves the resolution to 3.9 Å. All

837

procedures were performed with Relion (Scheres, 2016). The local resolution was

838

evaluated by ResMap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014).

839

Model building and refinement

840

The structures of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer and a human Fab fragment (Protein Data Bank

841

ID: 6VSB and 5N4J, respectively) were manually fitted into the refined map of SARS-

842

CoV-2 S trimer-HB27 complex in Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and then improved

843

by manual real-space refinement in COOT (Brown et al., 2015). The atomic model was

844

further subject to real-space positional and B-factor refinement using Phenix (Afonine

845

et al., 2012). The final models were evaluated using Molprobity (Chen et al., 2010).

846

Detailed informatin of the data sets and refinement statistics are summarized in Table

847

S2.

848

Surface plasmon resonance

849

The SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor to ~500 response units

850

(RUs) using Biacore 8K (GE Healthcare). Serial diluted HB27 or Fab fragments or

851

recombinant ACE2 flowed through the sensor. For competitive binding assays, the first

852

sample was allowed to flow over the chip at a rate of 20 μl/min for 120 s, and then the

853

second sample was injected at the same rate for another 120 s. The response units were

854

recorded and analyzed.

855

Plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT)

856

The neutralization activity of HB27 against SARS-CoV-2 were examined by standard

857

plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) in Vero cells. In brief, 5-fold serial

858

dilutions of HB27 were mixed with ~100 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 and incubated at 37 °C

859

for 1 hour. The mixture was then added to Vero-E6 cell monolayers in a 12-well plate

860

in duplicate and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. After which the mixture was removed,

861

and 1 ml of 1.0% (w/v) LMP agarose (Promega) in DMEM supplemented with 4% (v/v)

862

FBS was layered onto the infected cells. Following a two-day incubation at 37 °C, the

863

wells were stained with 1% (w/v) crystal violet in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde for plaque

864

Protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in hACE2 mice

867

The in vivo protection efficacy of HB27 antibody was evaluated using a newly

868

established mouse model based on a SARS-CoV-2 mouse adapted strain MASCp6 (Gu

869

et al., 2020) and a humanized hACE2 mouse model (Sun et al., 2020), respectively.

870

Briefly, a group of 6 to 8-week-old hACE2 humanized mice or BALB/c mice were

871

intraperitoneally administrated with HB27 (20 mg/kg) before (prophylactic) and/or

872

after (therapeutic) challenge with 5 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 or 1.6×104 PFU of

873

MASCp6 via intranasal route, respectively. All mice were monitored daily for

874

morbidity and mortality. The lung tissues of mice were collected at 3 and 5 dpi for viral

875

RNA loads assay and HE staining.

876

Viral RNA quantitation

877

Viral RNA quantification was performed by RT-qPCR aplying One Step PrimeScript

878

RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Japan). The primers and probe targeting against the gene of

879

SARS-CoV-2 S used for RT-qPCR were CoV-F3 (5’-TCCTGGTGATTCTT

880

CTTCAGGT-3’); CoV-R3 (5’-TCTGAGAGAGGGTCAAGTGC-3’); and CoV-P3 (5’-

881

FAM-AGCTGCAGCACCAGCTGTCCA -BHQ1-3’), respectively.

882

Pre- and post-adsorption inhibition assay

883

Pre- and post-adsorption inhibition assays were performed as described previously

884

(Wang et al., 2017). For the post-adsorption assay, SARS-CoV-2 was first added to Vero

885

cells for 1 hour at 4 °C, and then the cells were washed three times, following which

886

the mAb was added and incubated for 1 hour at 4 °C. For the pre-adsorption assay, the

887

mAb was firstly incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 4 °C before the mAb-virus

888

mixture was added to Vero cells. After three washes using PBS, the PRNT was

889

performed as described above. And the detection of the remaining amount of SARS-

890

CoV-2 RNA on the surface of Vero cells after HB27 treatment was carried out with

891

quantitative RT-PCR.

892

Histology and Immunostaining

893

Mouse tissues were excised and fixed with 10% neutral buffered formaline, and then

894

dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 4 μm thickness were obtained and

895

stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) following standard histological procedures.

896

Images were recorded using Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a DP72 camera.

Toxicokinetics of HB27 in Rhesus Monkeys

898

Rhesus macaques were randomly grouped into two groups, one group was given

899

placebo and one group was given a single dose of HB27 at 500 mg/kg intravenously.

900

Blood samples were collected at pre-dose, immediately after completion of dosing (± 1

901

minute), and 1h, 2h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h (Day 2), 48 h (Day 3), 72(Day4), 120 h (Day 6), 168

902

h (Day 8) and 336 h (Day 15) after beginning of infusion. Serum concentration of HB27

903

was measured using ELISA.

904

Clinical pathology of HB27 in Rhesus Monkeys

905

Blood samples were collected via forelimb or hindlimb subcutaneous vein at predose

906

and 3, 8 and 16 days postdose. Hematology parameters including white blood cells

907

(WBC), lymphocytes (Lymph), red blood cells (RBC) and hemoglobin concentration

908

(HGB) were measured using an ADVIA Hematology system. Clinical chemistry

909

parameters including AST (aspartate transaminase), ALT (alanine transaminase) and

910

ALP (alkaline phosphatase) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) were measured using

911

TBA-120FR. BD FACS Calibur Flow Cytometry was used for determinations of CD4+,

912

CD8+ T percentages.
