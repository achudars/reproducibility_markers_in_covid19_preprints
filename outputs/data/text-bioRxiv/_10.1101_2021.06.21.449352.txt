ABSTRACT

24

The high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 requires it to be handled under biosafety

25

level 3 conditions. Consequently, Spike protein pseudotyped vectors are a useful tool to

26

study viral entry and its inhibition, with retroviral, lentiviral (LV) and vesicular stomatitis

27

virus (VSV) vectors the most commonly used systems. Methods to increase the titer of

28

such vectors commonly include concentration by ultracentrifugation and truncation of the

29

Spike protein cytoplasmic tail. However, limited studies have examined whether such a

30

modification also impacts the protein’s function. Here, we optimized concentration

31

methods for SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped VSV vectors, finding that tangential flow

32

filtration produced vectors with more consistent titers than ultracentrifugation. We also

33

examined the impact of Spike tail truncation on transduction of various cell types and

34

sensitivity to convalescent serum neutralization. We found that tail truncation increased

35

Spike incorporation into both LV and VSV vectors and resulted in enhanced titers, but

36

had no impact on sensitivity to convalescent serum inhibition. In addition, we analyzed

37

the effect of the D614G mutation, which became a dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant early

38

in the pandemic. Our studies revealed that, similar to the tail truncation, D614G

39

independently increases Spike incorporation and vector titers, but that this effect is

40

masked by also including the cytoplasmic tail truncation. Therefore, the use of full-length

41

Spike protein, combined with tangential flow filtration, is recommended as a method to

42

generate high titer pseudotyped vectors that retain native Spike protein functions.

IMPORTANCE

45

Pseudotyped viral vectors are useful tools to study the properties of viral fusion proteins,

46

especially those from highly pathogenic viruses. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been

47

investigated using pseudotyped lentiviral and VSV vector systems, where truncation of its

48

cytoplasmic tail is commonly used to enhance Spike incorporation into vectors and to increase

49

the titers of the resulting vectors. However, our studies have shown that such effects can also

50

mask the phenotype of the D614G mutation in the ectodomain of the protein, which was a

51

dominant variant early in the COVID-19 pandemic. To better ensure the authenticity of Spike

52

protein phenotypes when using pseudotyped vectors, we therefore recommend using full-length

53

Spike proteins, combined with tangential flow filtration methods of concentration, if higher titer

54

vectors are required.

INTRODUCTION

56

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory

57

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was first reported in Wuhan, China, in

58

December 2019 (1). The disease rapidly spread worldwide, causing over 150 million

59

confirmed cases and more than 3 million reported deaths by May 2021 (2). The

60

accompanying worldwide research effort has resulted in a large number of vaccine

61

candidates, and both national and international clinical trials to assess novel and

62

repurposed drug regimens (3). In the United States, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein

63

has been a primary target of such efforts. Spike is a major viral antigen that induces

64

protective immune responses in COVID-19 (4–6) patients and mediates cell entry by

65

binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1, 7, 8) or other receptors (9, 10).

66

ACE2 is expressed in the human respiratory system (11), especially on type II

67

pneumocytes (12), which are the main target cell for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Expression

68

of ACE2 in other organs also allows infection outside the lung (11).

69

Due to the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, biosafety level 3 (BSL3) labs are

70

required for studies that involve replication-competent virus. Therefore, investigators

71

often use Spike protein pseudovirus vector systems, based on replication-incompetent

72

vector particles and attenuated or conditional viruses. Identification of an optimal

73

pseudovirus system for any particular viral entry glycoprotein typically involves comparing

74

the most commonly used systems: replication-incompetent lentiviral (LV) or retroviral (RV)

75

vectors, or conditional vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) viruses that are deleted for the

76

VSV glycoprotein (G) (13, 14). SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein can pseudotype all three

77

vector systems, which have been used to investigate viral entry (15–18), neutralization

78

by monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma (4, 5, 15, 19–27), entry inhibitors (15,

79

23, 28, 29), and to characterize surging viral variants (30–44). In approximately one third

80

of these studies, deletions of 18-21 amino acids from the cytoplasmic tail of Spike were

81

used to enhance vector titers and thereby facilitate the study.

82

Cytoplasmic tail truncation of viral glycoproteins is a common strategy to enhance

83

pseudovirus formation since this can remove steric interference that may occur between

84

the heterologous viral glycoproteins and the vector matrix or capsid proteins (45–50). Also

85

employed are cytoplasmic tail swaps, whereby the tail from the natural viral glycoprotein

86

is used to create a chimeric glycoprotein with enhanced incorporation properties (46, 51).

87

However, we and others have shown that tail modifications can also have functional

88

consequences, for example, removing endocytosis signals that lead to increased cell

89

surface levels and enhanced incorporation into vector particles (52, 53), alterations of the

90

ectodomain conformation (52, 54), changes to fusogenicity (46, 54–56) and altered

91

antigenic characteristics (57, 58).

92

SARS-CoV-2 Spike contains a putative ER retention signal (KLHYT) at its C-

93

terminus, which is removed by the tail truncations of 13 amino acids (59) or 18-21 amino

94

acids that are frequently employed (24, 60–63). Compared to the full-length Spike, such

95

truncations were reported to generate ~10-20-fold higher titers of both LV vectors (59–61,

96

63) and VSV vectors (24, 60, 62). Truncated Spike also enhances RV vector titers, albeit

97

with a smaller effect when compared side by side with LV and VSV vectors (60). Havranek

98

et al. (62) and Yu et al. (59) investigated the mechanism for such an effect for VSV and

99

LV pseudoviruses, and found that tail truncation enhanced both Spike incorporation into

100

the viral particles and cell-cell fusion for Spike-expressing cells, but without altering cell

101

surface expression levels. However, the impact of Spike tail truncations on any other

102

ectodomain functions remains unclear.

103

In this report, we compared the practicality and functionality of using Spike

104

pseudotyped vectors based on LV and VSV, and pseudotyped with either full-length or

105

tail truncated proteins. We compared methods to prepare such vectors and identified

106

tangential flow filtration as a facile method that is superior to ultracentrifugation and allows

107

efficient production at a larger scale. An optimized system based on VSV vectors was

108

used to assess the impact of the Spike mutation D614G (34), and to assess neutralizing

109

activity in convalescent serum. Our studies determined that although Spike tail truncation

110

boosts incorporation into vectors and enhances the titers achieved for unconcentrated

111

supernatants, it also blunted the ability to observe differences caused by this specific

112

Spike mutation. We therefore recommend that studies using Spike pseudotyped vectors

113

retain the natural full-length cytoplasmic tail and use other strategies, such as

114

concentration method and vector system choice, to achieve the required vector titers.

115
116

RESULTS

117
118

Spike cytoplasmic tail truncation facilitates vector incorporation and enhances titer

119

Cytoplasmic tail truncation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike has been reported to enhance

120

the transduction efficiency of pseudotyped LV and VSV vectors (59–61, 63) with the effect

121

suggested to be the result of enhanced incorporation and/or fusogenicity of Spike (59,

122

62). Using both the full-length Spike (S) and an 18 amino acid cytoplasmic tail truncation

123

(SΔ18), we generated pseudotyped LV and VSV vectors carrying reporter GFP or

124

luciferase genes, respectively. We compared the ability of the two Spike proteins to be

125

incorporated into the vectors and to transduce HeLa cells expressing human ACE2

126

(HeLa-ACE2). Transduction by LV-GFP vectors was analyzed at 48 hours post-

127

transduction, while VSV-Luc vectors were analyzed as early as 16-24 hours post-

128

transduction.

129

Consistent with previous findings, we found that the cytoplasmic tail truncation

130

increased vector transduction efficiency on HeLa-ACE2 cells, by approximately 4- and

131

30-fold for the LV-GFP and VSV-Luc vectors, respectively (Fig. 1A). We also observed a

132

significant increase in incorporation for the truncated Spike protein in both vector systems

133

(Fig. 1B), while having no impact on other viral particle proteins (Fig. 1B) or vector

134

genome copy number (Fig. 1C). Together, these results suggest that cytoplasmic tail

135

truncation increases Spike incorporation into both LV and VSV particles and this results

136

in higher infectivity per particle. Since the VSV-Luc vectors have a faster read-out time,

137

we chose this pseudovirus system for the rest of our studies.

138
139

Susceptibility of different cell lines and lung organoids to Spike protein

140

pseudovectors

141

Next, we tested the permissivity of different cell lines and a lung organoid model

142

to SΔ18 pseudotyped VSV vectors. In agreement with previous finding, several ACE2-

143

expressing cells were found to be susceptible to the vectors (1, 18), while ACE2 over-

144

expression was required to support transduction of HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). We also

145

evaluated an alternative transduction protocol with a shortened timeline, whereby

146

trypsinized cells are incubated with the vectors simultaneously with seeding (64).

147

Although this method shortened the overall process compared to a typical protocol that

148

first seeds the cells in a tissue culture plate for 24 hours before incubation with vectors, it

149

resulted in significantly lower transduction rates (Fig. 2B). Examination of cell surface

150

ACE2 levels by flow cytometry revealed that newly trypsinized cells had 1.5-fold lower

151

ACE2 levels compared to cells allowed to recover for 6 hours post-trypsinization (Fig. 2C),

152

suggesting the reason for the lower titers.

153

Finally, we tested the susceptibility of a 3D lung bud organoid model to SΔ18 VSV

154

pseudovectors carrying a GFP reporter. Compared to cell lines, lung organoids provide

155

more physiologically relevant models of virus infection and have been used to identify

156

candidate COVID-19 therapeutics (29). SΔ18 pseudotyped VSV-GFP vectors were able

157

to efficiently transduce the cells, with GFP expression observed throughout the organoid

158

by 24 hours (Fig. 2D).

To identify an optimal method for concentration of Spike protein pseudovectors

suitable for a research laboratory, we compared ultracentrifugation through a 20% w/v

sucrose cushion with tangential flow filtration (TFF). Ultracentrifugation is limited by the

165

capacity of a rotor, for example SW28 rotors have a maximum capacity of ~230 ml of

166

vector supernatant per 2 hours run. In contrast, TFF can process much larger volume

167

(65, 66) and a single TFF filter with 1000 cm2 surface area can process up to 3000 ml in

168

2 hours. Larger filter systems with capacities up to 15 L are also available. In addition,

169

VSV-G pseudotyped LV vectors produced by TFF are reported to have a higher recovery

170

rate than when prepared by ultracentrifugation (66).

171

To compare these approaches, 100 ml of SΔ18 pseudotyped VSV-Luc vector

172

supernatants were subjected to either ultracentrifugation (Ultra) or TFF and concentrated

173

into a 8ml final stock (12x, v/v). Vector genome copies in the unconcentrated and 12x

174

concentrated vector stocks were measured by ddPCR, which revealed slightly better

175

recovery rates following TFF (~70%) compared to ultracentrifugation (~60%) (Fig. 3A and

176

3B). At the same time, the transduction efficiencies of the three vector stocks were

177

measured on HeLa-ACE2 cells, using serially diluted vectors (1:5 to 1:450 dilutions) (Fig.

178

3C). At the higher dilution points, both 12x Ultra and 12x TFF vector preparations

179

produced about a 10-fold higher luciferase signal compared to the unconcentrated

180

vectors. Interestingly, at the lower dilutions (1:5 and 1:15), the 12x Ultra vector stock

181

showed no enhancement over unconcentrated vectors, while the 12x TFF vector stocks

182

retained their 10-fold higher transduction rates. This observation is suggestive of the

183

presence of an inhibitory factor that is concentrated during ultracentrifugation but was not

184

retained following TFF.

185

In summary, we found that TFF facilitates large-scale processing of vector stocks,

186

with similar genomic copy number recovery rates as the more typical ultracentrifugation

187

method. More importantly, TFF results in vector stocks that retain a more consistent titer

192

Cytoplasmic tail truncation alters Spike protein functional properties

193

We used the VSV pseudovirus system to examine the impact of the D614G

194

mutation of Spike protein. This mutation was first detected in China and Germany in late

195

January and became the dominant circulating variant of SARS-CoV-2 globally by April

196

2020 (34). The mutation has functional consequences for the virus, resulting in higher

197

viral loads in the upper respiratory tract (34, 67). In vitro studies with SARS-CoV-2

198

revealed that the D614G mutation enhanced replication on human lung epithelial cells

199

and primary airway tissue (41), and increased replication or transmissibility in human

200

ACE2 transgenic mice and hamster models (41, 68, 69). Effects were also observed using

201

Spike protein pseudoviruses, where the D614G mutation was reported to enhance Spike

202

incorporation into vector particles, despite minimal or no effect on Spike expression in

203

vector-producing cells (43, 70), and to increase transduction rates on various cell lines

204

(30, 32, 34, 37, 43, 63, 71).

205

Since we had noted that the cytoplasmic tail truncation of Spike protein also

206

increased incorporation rates and transduction efficiencies (Fig. 1), we next examined the

207

impact of the D614G mutation in the context of both full-length and truncated Spike

208

proteins. For the full-length Spike protein, we observed up to 18-fold higher transduction

209

rates for the G614 variant on HeLa-ACE2 cells, with less striking effects on the other cell

210

lines we tested. In contrast, transduction rates for the variants in the SΔ18 backbone

211

showed minimal to no differences across the range of cell types tested (Fig. 4A). The

212

discrepancy between the behavior of the full-length S and SΔ18 vectors occurred despite

213

similar genome copy numbers (Fig. 4B), ruling out an effect on vector production. We

214

also observed no differences in cell surface expression levels of Spike when comparing

215

the different variants in vector-producing cells (Fig. 4C). Instead, in agreement with

216

previous studies using full-length Spike pseudotyped RV and LV vectors, we found that

217

the D614G mutation enhanced Spike incorporation, albeit with a much larger effect for

218

the full-length Spike versus the truncated protein (~9-fold versus ~2-fold effect) (Fig. 4D,

219

E). Together, these observations suggest that a primary effect of both the tail truncation

220

and the D614G mutation is on Spike protein incorporation, which in turn leads to

221

enhanced titers, and that an upper limit for these effects likely reduces the impact of the

222

D614G mutation when combined with a tail truncation.

223
224

D614G mutation or cytoplasmic tail truncation does not alter Spike protein

225

sensitivity to convalescent serum

226

Spike protein pseudovectors are a useful tool to measure antibody neutralizing

227

activity in COVID-19 patient or convalescent sera (4, 5, 15, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 61).

228

We examined whether the D614G mutation or the cytoplasmic tail truncation altered

229

sensitivity to neutralization by a panel of convalescent sera. VSV-Luc vectors displaying

230

the four different Spike proteins were incubated with serially-diluted sera for 30 minutes

231

before being applied to HeLa-ACE2 cells. After normalizing values to the luciferase

232

signals obtained from cells transduced in the absence of sera, we observed that all four

233

Spike proteins exhibited similar sensitivities to each serum (Fig 5). This suggests that

234

neither the D614G mutation nor the cytoplasmic tail truncation alter the sensitivity of the

235

Spike protein to neutralization.

DISCUSSION

239

Pseudotyped vectors are a useful system to study the entry glycoproteins from

240

highly pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, as they remove the need for BSL-3

241

laboratory conditions. We confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was able to

242

pseudotype both LV and VSV vectors, and determined that the combination of using a

243

conditional VSV vector and a luciferase reporter gene had the advantage of allowing titers

244

to be read at 16 hours post-transduction. Such Spike pseudotyped VSV vectors

245

supported entry into a variety of mammalian cell types, including lung organoid systems,

246

making them a useful system with which to study SARS-CoV-2 entry under standard

247

laboratory conditions.

248

Optimization of pseudotyped vectors includes selection of an appropriate

249

concentration method, such as centrifugation, PEG precipitation or ultrafiltration. For VSV

250

pseudovectors, we found that concentration by TFF produced vector stocks with higher

251

recovery rates and more consistent titers throughout a dilution series than those produced

252

by ultracentrifugation. TFF also has the advantage of providing a partial purification due

253

to the selective loss of potential contaminants below the cut-off value of the filter, and

254

provides a larger processing capacity than ultracentrifugation. As a result, TFF is

255

frequently used to facilitate large-scale vector production, including for clinical use (65,

256

66, 72). In our own experience, 3L of supernatant can be concentrated down to 50ml in

257

2 hours.

258

Since pseudovector titers can be impacted by incompatibilities between a viral

259

fusion protein and the heterologous viral particle (45–50), an additional strategy to

260

enhance vector titers has been to truncate the fusion protein’s cytoplasmic tail. We found

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.21.449352; this version posted June 22, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

261

that this approach increased the titers of Spike protein pseudovectors based on both LV

262

and VSV, in agreement with previous reports (24, 59–63). Furthermore, as others have

263

also noted (59, 62), the enhanced vector titers correlated with increased levels of Spike

264

protein incorporation that were not simply the result of higher levels of cell surface

265

expression following tail truncation, and tail truncation has also been reported to enhance

266

the fusogenicity of Spike (59, 62). Together, this suggests that truncation of the

267

cytoplasmic could also alter the conformation or function of the protein’s ectodomain, as

268

has been reported for viral fusion proteins in HIV (57), measles virus (56), simian

269

immunodeficiency virus (55) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (46), where truncation of the

270

cytoplasmic tail impacted ectodomain conformation or functions such as receptor binding,

271

or fusogenicity.

272

Our comparison of techniques to enhance vector titers also identified an area for

273

caution; although cytoplasmic tail truncation enhanced pseudovector titers, they can also

274

have unintended functional consequences. Specifically, we found that the impact of the

275

D614G mutation on Spike protein incorporation and vector titer was obscured by the

276

cytoplasmic tail truncation. A similar lack of effect of the D614G mutation on titer was also

277

reported in another study using a 21 amino acid deletion of the Spike protein cytoplasmic

278

tail in VSV pseudovectors (62). These findings suggest that tail-truncated Spike proteins

279

should be used with caution for studies analyzing the impact of Spike mutations, or to test

280

potential therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 entry.

281

The mechanism for enhanced incorporation and/or titer by D614G is not entirely

282

understood but structural analyses have suggested that it could impact Spike protein

283

structure and stability, both within and between Spike monomers. For example, it has

284

been suggested that a glycine at this location could strengthen the association between

285

the S1/S2 subunits through an impact on the epistructure that decreases the

286

intramolecular wrapping in the S1 subunit but promotes intermolecular wrapping between

287

S1 and S2 (73). In an alternative model, the D614G mutation could alter the structure

288

and/or stability of the Spike trimer by abrogating the hydrogen bond connecting D614 in

289

the S1 subunit of one monomer with T859 in the S2 subunit of a neighboring monomer

290

(34). These alterations were hypothesized to result in a greater tendency of the G614

291

monomers to form stable trimers which, in turn, could facilitate their incorporation into

292

virions. As evidence, a mixture of equal amounts of D614 and G614 Spike variants

293

expressed in vector-producing cells resulted in a higher level of G614 proteins in the

294

incorporated Spike trimers (70).

295

Finally, we also used the VSV pseudovectors to evaluate the impact of the D614G

296

mutation on infectivity of different cell types and sensitivity to antibody neutralization.

297

Consistent with previous findings using pseudoviruses (32–34, 37, 43, 44) or SARS-CoV-

298

2 virions (41, 68), we found that the G614 variant exhibited enhanced transduction of

299

various cell lines when compared to the D614 variant, and that this correlated with

300

increased Spike incorporation into the VSV particles (43, 70). As previously noted, these

301

effects were significantly abrogated when tail truncated variants were used, consistent

302

with an upper limit for the enhancement of Spike incorporation.

303

In contrast, the serum neutralization studies revealed no differences in sensitivity

304

for either residue at position 614, and in either of the cytoplasmic tail configurations. This

305

is in agreement with the majority of reports testing the impact of the D614G mutation with

306

full-length Spike

pseudovectors or SARS-CoV-2 virus against human convalescent

307

serum (30, 34, 43, 68), serum from convalescent animals (41), or vaccinated human or

308

animals (44, 68, 74).

309

In summary, we found that although cytoplasmic tail truncations enhance SARS-

310

CoV-2 Spike protein incorporation into both LV and VSV vectors, and enhance the titers

311

of unconcentrated vectors, they can also mask the phenotype of the D614G mutation.

312

Pseudotyped vectors are increasingly being used to study newly emerging SARS-CoV-2

313

variants, where both full-length (42, 75) and truncated Spike proteins (25, 35, 39) have

314

been used in studies investigating the impact of mutations on Spike protein properties

315

such as ACE2 binding, transduction efficiency or sensitivity to neutralization. To better

316

ensure the authenticity of the Spike protein functions being investigated in such vectors,

317

we recommend using a full-length Spike protein, and combining vector production with

318

TFF if higher titer vectors are required.

METHODS

321

Plasmids. Full-length (S) and 18 amino acid cytoplasmic tail truncated (SΔ18) Spike

322

proteins for the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3) were

323

provided by Dr. James Voss (The Scripps Research Institute) in a plasmid pcDNA3.3

324

backbone. D614G mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. A VSV G

325

protein expression plasmid was obtained from Addgene (Watertown, MA; Cat.# 8454).

326
327

Cell lines. 293T, HeLa, HeLa-ACE2, Vero, VeroE6 and Huh7.5 cells were maintained in

328

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM), and Calu-3 cells were maintained in Eagle's

329

Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM). All media were supplemented with 4 mM glutamine

330

and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HeLa-ACE2 cells were provided by Dr. James Voss,

331

and were generated by transduction of HeLa cells with a lentiviral vector packaging a

332

CMV-ACE2 expression cassette. The Huh7.5 cell line was provided by Dr. Jae Jung

333

(Cleveland Clinic). All other cell lines were obtained from ATCC.

334
335

VSV vector production, concentration and transduction. Replication-deficient

336

VSVΔG vectors (76), containing expression cassettes for firefly luciferase or GFP in place

337

of the VSV G protein, were provided by Dr. Jae Jung and Dr. Oscar Negrete (Sandia

338

National Laboratories), respectively. To generate Spike pseudotyped VSV vectors, 4 x

339

106 293T cells were seeded in DMEM plus 10% FBS in a 10cm plate and transfected with

340

15 μg of Spike expression plasmid 24 hours later, using the calcium-phosphate

341

transfection method (76). Media was replaced 16 hours later with 10 ml fresh media, and

342

after a further 8 hours, 5 ml was removed and 2x108 vector genomes of VSVΔG particles

343

were added for one hour at 37 °C. Following this incubation, cells were washed three

344

times with PBS and incubated for a further 24 hours before harvesting supernatants.

345

For larger scale production, quantities were adjusted to seed 3x107 cells in 500cm2

346

plates, transfection with 124.5 μg of Spike expression plasmid and infection by 1.7x109

347

vector genomes of VSVΔG particles per 500cm2 plate. To propagate VSVΔG particles,

348

the same protocol was followed but replacing the Spike expression plasmid with the same

349

quantity of a VSV G expression plasmid, and no PBS washes were performed after

350

infection by VSVΔG.

351

Vector supernatants were harvested and filtered through 0.45 μm syringe filters,

352

and either aliquoted or concentrated by ultracentrifugation using 20% (w/v) sucrose

353

cushions for 2 hours at 25,000 rpm in an SW41 or SW28 rotor (Beckman, Indianapolis,

354

IN). Alternatively, large-scale supernatant preparations were concentrated by tangential

355

flow filtration (TFF) using a polyethersulfone membrane hollow fiber unit with 100 kDa

356

molecular weight cut off and 155cm2 filtration surface (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho

357

Dominguez, CA) and a KR2i peristaltic pump (Spectrum Laboratories). To perform buffer

358

exchange and prevent filter blockage, every 100 ml of vector supernatant was followed

359

by 100 ml PBS. A 10- to 12-fold concentration from the original volume to approximately

360

8 ml final volume was achieved. All vectors were stored at -80oC in aliquots.

361

VSV-luciferase vector transductions were performed on tissue culture treated, 96-

362

well half-area white plates (Corning, Corning, NY), seeded with various cells lines to

363

achieve 50%-75% confluency at the time of transduction. Vectors were serially diluted

364

and added to the culture to achieve final dilutions of 1:5, 1:15, 1:45, 1:135, and 1:405 and

365

incubated at 37 °C for 16-24 hours. Transduction efficiency was quantified by measuring

366

luciferase activity in cell lysates using Britelite Plus (Perkin Elmer, Richmond, California)

367

and following the manufacturer’s protocol. To calculate the fold-change in transduction

368

efficiency between D614 and G614 mutants, data from the 1:45 dilution points was used.

369

To titer VSV-GFP vectors, HeLa-ACE2 cells were seeding as 1x104 cells per well

370

in 96-well plates, and the following day, 50 μl of serially-diluted unconcentrated vector

371

stocks were added. The final dilutions in the cultures were 1:2, 1:6, 1:18, and 1:27.

372

Transduction efficiency was determined by GFP expression 16-24 hours after

373

transduction using flow cytometry (Guava easyCyte, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA). and

374

transducing units (TU) per ml calculated from the dilutions showing a linear relationship

375

between the dilution factor and the number of GFP-positive cells.

Lentiviral vector production, concentration and transduction. Lentiviral vectors were

378

generated by transfection of 10 cm plates of 293T cells at 75% confluency with 2 μg of

379

Spike expression plasmid, 10 μg of packaging plasmid pCMVdeltaR8.2 (Addgene Cat.#

380

12263) and 10 μg of a GFP-expressing vector genome plasmid FUGW (Addgene Cat.#

381

14883). Media was removed 16 hours later and replaced with 10 ml fresh DMEM plus

382

10% FBS. Supernatants were harvested 48 hours after transfection and filtered through

383

0.45 μm syringe filters, and either aliquoted or concentrated by ultracentrifugation using

384

20% (w/v) sucrose cushions for 2 hours at 25,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman).

385

HeLa-ACE2 cells were transduced with Spike pseudotyped LV by seeding 1x104

386

cells per well in 96-well plates and adding 50μl of unconcentrated vector stocks the next

387

day. Transduction efficiency was determined by GFP expression 48 hours after

388

transduction using flow cytometry, as described above, and reported as transducing units

plated onto fibronectin-coated, six-well tissue culture plates (80,000–105,000 cells/cm2).

423

Cells were incubated in SFD medium supplemented with 100ng/ml human Noggin (R&D

424

Systems) and 10μM SB431542 for 24 hours followed by switching to SFD media

425

supplemented with 10 μM SB431542 and 1 μM IWP2 (R&D Systems) for another 24

430

suspended by gently pipetting around the wells to form lung bud organoids, which were

431

maintained in Ultra-Low Attachment multiple well plates (Corning) and fed every other

432

day, and used for vector transduction after day 35.

433

To transduce lung bud organoids, 10 to 20 organoids were picked manually and

434

transferred to 96-well U-bottom plates and transduced with 50 μl of GFP-expressing VSV

Convalescent serum neutralization. Convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients or

475

healthy donors (collected before April 30, 2020) was obtained from Children’s Hospital

A suitable dose of Spike pseudotyped VSV-Luc vectors was used in the

480

neutralization assays to produce approximately 105 relative light unit (RLU) of luciferase

481

activity on HeLa-ACE2 cells in the absence of serum. Five x103 HeLa-ACE2 cells were

482

seeded in tissue culture-treated, 96-well half-area white plates (Corning) to achieve 50%-

483

75% confluency the following day. Convalescent or control sera were 3-fold serially

diluted from 1:10 to 1:7290 and 50 μl incubated with the predetermined dose of the VSV-

485

Luc vectors for 30 mins at 37°C, before addition of the mixture to HeLa-ACE2 cells. Cells

486

were incubated at 37 °C overnight for 16-24 hours. Vector transduction efficiency was

quantified by measuring luciferase activity as described above and neutralization (%)

488

calculated by normalization to the values obtained on cells transduced without serum.
