Abstract: Rapid and widespread implementation of infectious disease surveillance is a critical

10

component in the response to novel health threats. Molecular assays are the preferred method to

11

detect a broad range of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. The implementation of

12

molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency can be hindered by resource

13

availability or technical constraints. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of

14

a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited

15

resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have

16

different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data.

17

Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of

18

disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases

19

in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a

20

viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19.

22

Emerging infectious diseases pose a global hazard to public health, as exemplified by the COVID-

23

19 pandemic. Key epidemiologic strategies for control of community spread include contact tracing,

24

case isolation, ring containment, and social distancing (1–7). The use of microbiological testing to

25

identify disease cases is a crucially important element of these strategies. Some countries, including

26

the US, experienced a shortage of kits needed for COVID-19 diagnosis, which resulted in the

27

imposition of restrictive criteria to manage the selection of patients for testing. Constraints in the

28

supply of kits had a particularly significant impact on testing of mildly symptomatic individuals, as

29

well as asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases. For some facilities that have been overwhelmed

30

by demand for testing as the pandemic progressed, test throughput continues to be a limiting factor

31

(8–10). Strategies for screening more individuals with a reduced burden on resources are highly

32

desirable. Using a Bayesian formalism, a hierarchical testing protocol based on sample pooling is

33

discussed. Anticipated benefits include easing the demand of constrained resources and enabling

34

more efficient detection of a larger number of cases.

35

Molecular assays are the predominant testing method for viral and bacterial pathogens (11–14).

36

Specifically, nucleic acid detection assays typically employ real-time polymerase chain reaction

37

(RT-PCR) for DNA targets and reverse-transcription real-time PCR (rRT-PCT) for RNA targets

38

(15, 16). The popularity of such testing platforms is due to 1) their high sensitivity and specificity,

39

2) the widespread access to sequencing and synthesis technologies for the identification of nucleic

40

acid target sequences and probes, and 3) the development of fast, user-friendly, and cost-effective

41

equipment. While nucleic acid assays have powered a revolution in diagnostics and delivery of care

42

for individual patients, their application in large-scale infectious disease surveillance is hampered

43

partly by low throughput at a population level.

44

The information content of a diagnostic test can be evaluated with a Bayesian probability formalism

45

in the context of an individual sample or for repeated sampling from the same patient (17–19) by

46

taking into account the probability of detecting a positive case (assay sensitivity, or identification

47

rate 𝑃 ) and the probability of a positive result from healthy samples (false positive rate 𝑃 ).

48

Bayesian inference requires the assessment of a “prior” probability to the presence of disease in a

49

sample, 𝑃(𝐷), which is updated to a “posterior” probability given a positive or negative test result

50

with conditional probabilities 𝑃(𝐷|+) or 𝑃(𝐷|−) (Eq. 1.a-b).

51

𝑃(𝐷|+) =

(Eq. 1a)

𝑃(𝐷|−) =

( )

( )∙(

( )

(Eq. 1b)

52

where 𝑃(+) and 𝑃(−) are the overall probabilities of the test yielding a positive or negative result,

53

respectively. These tools can be extended to the somewhat counterintuitive situation where a

54

diagnostic test is conducted on a sample pooled from multiple individuals. The motivation for

55

sample pooling is to screen multiple patients simultaneously and reduce the burden on testing

56

facilities working with limited resources. Pooling schemes have been developed since their

57

introduction in the 1940s for syphilis testing, and have been applied to screen for and estimate

58

prevalence rates of a variety of diseases (20-24). Here, a simple two-step hierarchical protocol first

59

introduced by Dorfman is considered: Samples from 𝑁 patients are collected and randomly pooled

60

into groups of 𝑛 individual samples each. Pooled samples are interrogated with the diagnostic test.

61

If pooled testing yields a negative result, no further testing is conducted. If pooled testing yields a

62

positive result, all patients in that pool are tested individually.

63

While statistical approaches have been focused on characterizing the performance of various

64

pooling schemes, not all of them include non-ideal test parameters (25). Moreover, testing

65

characteristics at the pooled- and individual-sample levels can be different. Here, the Bayesian

66

inference approach in Eq. 1.a-b is modified to include differences in the assay sensitivity and

67

overall probability of a positive result in pooled vs. individual tests (Eq. S1-2). Sensitivity loss is

68

included as a reduction in the identification rate of pooled-sample tests by a scaling factor 𝛾. Due to

69

the exceptional specificities of nucleic acid assays, the false positive rate is assumed to remain

unaffected. Importantly, the posterior probability assessed from a positive pooled test is used as a

71

prior for follow-up individual tests, which yields additional information and enhances the Bayesian

72

inference assessment of those cases (Eq. S3).

73

For a population of 𝑁 patients divided into sample pools of size 𝑛, the average number of tests is

74

the number of initial pooled tests plus the expected number of follow-up tests (Eq. S4). Throughput

75

increase 𝜒 is expressed as the effective number of individuals screened by each diagnostic test (Eq.

76

S5). The individual- and pooled-sample test characteristics determine the pool size that optimizes

77

screening throughput as a function of average disease prevalence in the tested population.

78

The advantages of pooled-sample screening are discussed in the context of the rapidly evolving

79

COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) (8, 26). A recent rRT-PCR

80

assay for COVID-19 reports an identification rate of 95% and no false positives after testing 310

81

samples including other respiratory pathogens (27). Given reported specificities of commercially-

82

available respiratory panel assays (>99%), an estimated 1% false positive rate was included in the

83

model results reported here. A moderate reduction in the identification rate for a pooled sample

84

(𝛾 = 0.9) was assumed – this variable is discussed in detail below. Consistent with similar

85

implementations of Dorfman-type testing algorithms (28), substantial increases in testing

86

throughput are predicted for low disease prevalence rates (𝑃(𝐷) ≤8%, Fig. 1), where throughput

87

more than doubles and optimal pool sizes are 4 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 12. At intermediate prevalence rates 0.1 ≤

88

𝑃(𝐷) ≤ 0.2, the increase in throughput is moderate yet substantial (>30% increase in throughput)

89

and pool sizes are small (𝑛 = 3). For high prevalence rates, pooling yields no improvement

90

(optimal pool size 𝑛 = 1). Average disease prevalence can be re-assessed as information is gained

91

for the tested population to re-optimize pool size. Dynamic self-tuning is a feature of Bayesian

92

inference, a significant asset when a close feedback loop is desirable.

93

Besides testing throughput, it is informative to assess the increased ability to detect cases using a

94

pooled-sample vs individual-sample scheme, which can be accomplished by comparing the ratio of

95

detected to missed cases in each protocol. Importantly, resource constraints are incorporated into

96

this comparison by accounting for unscreened cases in the standard 1:1 scheme (Eq. S6-8). The

97

relative increase in the detection-to-miss ratio between the pooled and standard 1:1 schemes

98

exhibits even more significant gains than those observed for testing throughput (Fig. 1).

prevalence. Gray line is the no-pooling scheme reference.

103

Loss in screening power associated with sample pooling is assessed by 1) estimating the portion of

104

cases that would have been identified in an individual test but missed by pooled screening, and 2)

105

determining the information gained for patients whose pooled screening result was negative.

106

A reduction in overall pathogen concentration due to pooling in conditions of low disease

107

prevalence can decrease the test’s identification rate, although it is manageable when targeting

108

infectious diseases for which typical pathogen concentrations are non-negligible (23). This concern

109

is examined with a set of 186 positive rRT-PCR diagnostic test results for COVID-19 (Fig. 2),

110

which include nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, and bronchoalveolar lavage (29). Tests

111

have a mean cycle threshold value of 〈𝐶 〉 = 24.6, and a positive test result is defined as a rRT-PCR

112

reaction with 𝐶 ≤ 42 – in agreement with early reports for nasal swab COVID-19 rRT-PCR tests

113

with 〈𝐶 〉 = 24.3 and viral loads of 1.4 × 10 copies/mL (30). From these data, the portion of

114

samples that would have had a positive test result even if pooled with an entirely healthy population

115

is estimated using a pool size 𝑛 = 12 and rRT-PCR geometric efficiencies of 𝜖 = 1.7 − 2 per

116

cycle. A pooled screening protocol would have detected 95.7-96.8% of these cases (178-180 out of

117

186). Further support for moderate sensitivity loss can be achieved by dividing the distribution of 𝐶

118

values for the test-positive samples into three subpopulations. For the same pooling and rRT-PCR

119

efficiencies stated previously, >95% of the broadest, lowest-load population would be detected.

124

The main benefit of hierarchical pooled-sample testing protocols is the ability to screen a larger

125

portion of the population and detect more positive cases. The relative increase in case detection is

126

given by the ratio of the number of cases detected in a pooled setting and the number of cases

127

detected if the same number of tests were used on single patients – the multiplicative factor in

128

testing throughput scaled by the loss in sensitivity, 𝜒 ∙ 𝛾. Loss in sensitivity also leads to more

129

screened-yet-missed cases – even in the absence of pooling, diagnostic tests yield false negatives

130

and increasing those odds should not be considered lightly. In the range of disease prevalence with

131

moderate to high increase in throughput and compared to individual testing of every patient, a 𝛾 =

132

0.9 sensitivity loss leads to a relatively low increase in posterior probability of disease after a

133

negative test outcome, 𝑃(𝐷|−) (Fig. 3). While sensitivity losses decrease the ability to confidently

134

screen healthy individuals, the threshold for this tradeoff depends on the situation where the

135

screening protocol is deployed. Effective risk communication to screened individuals is needed to

136

prevent an outsized sense of security after a negative pooled-test result – e.g., vigilance to symptom

137

development triggers individual testing.

145

population sampling and prior probabilities will provide further screening improvements. From an

146

epidemiological surveillance standpoint, increased detection of positive cases in a larger portion of

147

the population denotes that a greater fraction of infectious individuals can be isolated. However,

148

pooled testing in less useful in an inpatient clinical setting where the highest sensitivity is needed to

149

minimize risk of hospital transmission from non-isolated patients. As with any change in the

150

delivery of medical care, a discussion including community stakeholders is paramount.

151

In summary, a pooled testing strategy has the potential to enhance comprehensive surveillance of

152

SARS-CoV-2 particularly when test kits are in short supply. The benefits of surveillance are

153

greatest in the early phases of community spread. Thus, improving the capacity for high-throughput

154

testing has the highest impact when prevalence is low enough that pooled sampling is most

155

beneficial. The ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases to tests performed varies by country, but it

156

appears that aggressive testing strategies yield a low enough prevalence to benefit from pooled-

157

sample screening – e.g., South Korea’s is 3% (8.3k/270k as of 3/16/2020) (32). While the

158

development of clinical prediction rules and non-testing screening are critical to any

159

epidemiological response, dealing with a novel disease for which data is still sparse and testing

160

capabilities are limited means that maximizing the impact of each individual test can benefit the

161

continued refinement of our strategy.

Full vs. partial optimization. In a fully optimized scheme a pooled-sample’s positive result triggers

a cascade of smaller-sized pools, minimizing the number of tests performed. However, an

intermediate improvement is chosen due to possible adverse outcomes of a lengthier process with

several pooling and Bayesian inference steps – e.g., possible delay of necessary care, increased

Advantages in testing throughput and case detection
We can estimate the ratio of detected-to-missed (including unscreened) cases for each protocol

In the pooled scheme, the number of detected cases are the total number of screened individuals

To further illustrate this, consider a disease including asymptomatic-yet-infectious individuals

319

and for which clinical predictions are at an early stage, preventing effective triage against conditions

320

presenting similar symptoms. A screening point must decide how to use limited resources (e.g.,

321

4,000 available tests) to detect the maximum number of cases in a population at 5% risk. Using the

322

test characteristics described in the main text (𝑃

compare the pooled-sample screening protocol vs. standard 1:1: testing. On average, a pooled-

324

sample approach allows testing 10,000 individuals, detecting 406 cases while missing 94 and

325

yielding 18 false positives; conversely, a standard 1:1 approach would test 4,000 individuals and

undetected.

What if the rRT-PCR test sensitivity is much lower than expected – say 𝑃

= 0.70? Let us

329

also consider a much more pessimistic estimate for sensitivity loss, 𝛾 = 0.8 and no change in the

pooling scheme (for these new parameters, optimal pool size is 𝑛 = 7). It would detect 246 and

surprisingly, the number of false negatives increases substantially in both scenarios due to the lower

starting point for the test’s sensitivity. However, in a pooled scheme 381 infected individuals are

336

still at risk of spreading the disease in the community, while in the 1:1 scheme 487 infected

individuals remain at risk of further community spread. As mentioned in the main text, effective
