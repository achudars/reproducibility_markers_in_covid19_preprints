Abstract
Background: Aerosolization of respiratory droplets is considered the main route of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, reducing the viral load of Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shed via respiratory droplets is potentially an ideal strategy to prevent the
spread of the pandemic. The in vitro virucidal activity of intranasal Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) has been
demonstrated recently to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titres. This study evaluated the virucidal activity of
the aqueous solution of Iodine-V (a clathrate complex formed by elemental iodine and fulvic acid) as
in Essential Iodine Drops (EID) with 200 µg elemental iodine/ml content against SARS-CoV-2 to
ascertain whether it is a better alternative to PVP-I.
Methods: SARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020 strain) virus stock was prepared by infecting Vero 76 cells
(ATCC CRL-1587) until cytopathic effect (CPE). The virucidal activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 was
tested in three dilutions (1:1; 2:1 and 3:1) in triplicates by incubating at room temperature (22 ± 2°C)
for either 60 or 90 seconds. The surviving viruses from each sample were quantified by a standard
end-point dilution assay.
Results: EID (200 µg iodine/ml) after exposure for 60 and 90 seconds was compared to controls. In
both cases, the viral titre was reduced by 99% (LRV 2.0). The 1:1 dilution of EID with virus reduced
SARS-CoV-2 virus from 31,623 cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCCID50) to 316 CCID50 within 90
seconds.
Conclusion: Substantial reductions in LRV by Iodine-V in EID confirmed the activity of EID against SARSCoV-2 in vitro, demonstrating that Iodine-V in EID is effective at inactivating the virus in vitro and
therefore suggesting its potential application intranasally to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from
known or suspected COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
The global pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China during late 2019
(1). It has since spread rapidly globally, with over 26 million confirmed cases to date and over 865000
deaths. The rapid spread of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is enhanced by the shading of viral particles
from infected or symptomatic individuals through bodily secretions, especially respiratory droplets
including saliva, and nasal fluid. It has been demonstrated that tiny droplets of 0-10 μm diameter
produced during speech-making, sneezing, coughing, and panting contain SARS-CoV-2 viral particles
(2), which remained substantially viable and infectious in aerosols for up to 3 hours, similar to SARSCoV-1 (3). Thus, it is presumed that the most effective infection mechanism is the aerosolization of

viral particles in respiratory droplets (4), which is easily inoculated directly into the airway during
breathing or indirectly by contact transfer via contaminated hands (5). The aerosolized microscopic
infectious viral particles can linger in the air circulating in poorly ventilated rooms or spaces long
enough to cause multiple infections to individuals who inhale them (6). A raft of recommended
preventive measures including wearing face masks, eye protection, washing hands and keeping social
distance on > 1 m have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing COVID-19 transmission (7). The
goal of face masks is to reduce the transmission of respiratory droplets from infected individuals and
shield non-infected individuals from transmitted droplets. Face masks as vital Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE) against COVID-19 disease is not fully accepted and has remained controversial from
perspectives of attitude, effectiveness, and necessity (8).
In the initial stage of COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2 viral titres of > 107/ml in saliva and nasal mucous
have been reported; and therefore, reduction of these titres should help to reduce disease
transmission from known COVID-19 patients to individual who is uncomfortable using masks (9). This
can be achieved using oral and nasal sprays with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Intranasal
saline sprays containing elemental iodine as an active ingredient has been used for nasal moisturizing
and prevention and/or treatment of sinusitis or rhinitis (10). Iodine-containing intranasal/oral
moisturizing saline sprays are being explored as drug agents against coronaviruses. Their potential use
has been supported by a recent clinical safety trial that demonstrated that intranasal Povidone-Iodine
(PVP-I; 1.25%) spray had no adverse effects for up to five months and therefore, could be used against
coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1/2 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - MERS) (11). Regarding the
antiviral efficacy of iodine-containing nasal/oral sprays, nasal and oral formulations containing PVP-I
have been reported to inactive SARS-Cov-2 in vitro (12, 13). Thus, PVP-I oral antiseptic is potentially
efficacious in reducing the transmission risk of coronaviruses in dental practice (13). SARS-CoV-2 is
internalized into the host cells via two viral receptors of host cell infection: Angiotensin-Converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and CD147 (a highly-glycosylated transmembrane protein) by binding to them using
virus spike proteins (SP) (14). The mechanism of action of PVP-I mouth rinse/nasal spray involves
targeting of the host’s ACE2 for inhibition. It inactivates the activity of Haemagglutinin Esterase (HE),
a fifth important structural protein of beta-coronaviruses and diminishes the ACE2 receptors in
lymphocytes by promoting their absorption from host epithelial tissue (14). This reduces the
concentration of SARS-CoV-1/2 shed in saliva and nasal fluid.
Enthused by promising findings from a recent study by Pelletier and colleagues (12), the present study
was interested in Essential Iodine Drops (EID) for oral/nasal decontaminant in known or suspected
cases of COVID-19 as a potentially better alternative to PVP-I. Iodine-V is a novel complex derivative
of fulvic acid in a clathrate complex by elemental iodine (I2) molecule. Essential Iodine Drops (EID) is
an aqueous solution of Iodine-V containing 200 µg elemental iodine/ml. EID is currently used as an
oral dietary supplement to support a healthy thyroid function and is non-toxic, non-allergic and lends
itself to prolonged continuous use if kept within the daily recommended upper limit of 1100 µg. Its
potential for use in protecting against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus during elective surgical
procedures in ophthalmology, otolaryngology and dental has been demonstrated recently using PVPI solutions (12). Whilst steps are already being made to make Essential Iodine Drops (EID) available for
nasal administration, the present study was conducted to ascertain whether the EID solution is
effective in deactivating SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, as demonstrated with PVP-I. Therefore, this research
aims to evaluate the in vitro virucidal efficacy of Essential Iodine Drops (EID) on SARS-CoV-2 to
ascertain whether it is a better alternative to PVP-I.

Materials and Methods
The present study tested the virucidal efficacy of Essential Iodine Drops (EID) against SARS-CoV-2
using similar materials and protocol by Pelletier and colleagues (12). Importantly, the present study
was conducted in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories at The Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah
State University, USU (Logan, UT) following established Standard Operating Procedures approved by
the USU Biohazards Committee.

Cell lines and virus
Before testing, a virus stock of SARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020 strain) sourced from the CDC following its
original isolation from an infected patient in Washington state, USA (WA-1 strain BEI #NR-52281
strain), was prepared according to Pelletier and colleagues (12). The virus stock was prepared by
infecting Vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587) until cytopathic effect (CPE) was visible at two days postinoculation. The Vero 76 cells were cultured in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (Quality Biological),
supplemented with 2% (v/v) Fetal Bovine Serum (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Gemini Bioproducts)(12).

Drug testing
The test drug was Essential Iodine Drops (EID), obtained from IOI Investment Zrt. (Budapest, Hungary).
It is the aqueous solution of Iodine-V. The Iodine-V is a water-soluble elemental iodine in fulvic acid
clathrate complex. Physical and chemical properties of Iodine-V are as follows: iodine content as
determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) was 10.01%; the melting
point was 157°C, the maximum ultra-violate/visible (UV/VIS) absorption in the water at 340 nm was
96 µg/ml); the spectral signature of Iodine-V as analysed by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectra (FTIR)
in KBr pastille contained the following wavenumbers (ν; cm-1) of key signals: 3404, 2927, 2359, 2341,
1718, 1635, 1558, 1418, 1383, 1151, 1076, 1024, 668. The melting point was determined in an SRS
100 OptiMelt apparatus (Stanford Research Systems, Sunnyvale, CA, US). Ultraviolet was measured in
a DLab SP1100 system. FT-IR was measured in FTIR650 (Labfreez Instruments Group Co., Ltd.).
The virucidal activity of Essential Iodine Drops against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in three dilutions; 1:1;
2:1 and 3:1. The original concentration of Essential Iodine Drops as supplied by IOI Investment Zrt was
200 µg elemental iodine/ml. This was subsequently diluted with SARS-CoV-2 virus solution to 1:1 for
90 seconds, 2:1 for 60 seconds and 3:1 for 60 seconds.

Virucidal Assay
Briefly, the three dilutions of Essential Iodine Drops (EID) containing SARS-CoV-2 virus solution (1:1;
2:1 and 3:1) were tested in triplicates for virucidal activity as described by Pelletier and colleagues
(12). The undiluted drug as supplied (without virus solution) in two tubes was used as toxicity and
neutralization controls. Ethanol (70%) was used as the positive control while water was used as a virus
control. The test solution and virus were incubated together at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) for either
60 seconds and 90 seconds and the solution were then neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in MEM with FBS
(2%) and gentamicin (50μg/ml).

Virus Quantification
The survived viruses from each sample were quantified by a standard end-point dilution assay
according to Pelletier and colleagues (12). Briefly, neutralized samples were pooled and serially diluted
using eight log dilutions in the test medium. Subsequently, 100 μL of each dilution was plated into
quadruplicate wells of 96-well, plates containing 80-90% confluent Vero 76 cells. The toxicity controls
were added to an additional 4 wells of Vero 76 cells and 2 of those wells at each dilution were infected
with the virus to serve as neutralization controls, ensuring that the residual sample in the titre assay
plate did not inhibit growth and detection of the surviving virus. Plates were incubated (37 ± 2°C with
35% CO2) for 5 days. Each well was then scored for the presence or absence of the infectious virus.
The titres were measured using a standard endpoint dilution 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50)
assay calculated using the Reed-Muench (1938) equation and the log reduction value (LRV) of each
compound compared to the negative (water) control was calculated(12).

Results
Infectious SARS-CoV-2 viruses were quantified by endpoint dilution virus titration on Vero cells and
the results were expressed as log10 cell culture of 50% infectious dose (log10 CCID50). Virus titres and
log reduction value (LRV) of SARS-CoV-2 when incubated with a single concentration of the test drug
for each time point are shown in Table 1. After 90 seconds of incubation, 1:1 EID reduced viral titre by
99% from 4.5 log10 CCID50/0.1 ml to 2.5 log10 CCID50/0.1 ml giving an LRV of 2.0. It reduced the virus
from 31,623 CCID50 to 316 CCID50 per 0.1ml. After 60 seconds, 3:1 EID reduced viral titre by 99% from
4.0 log10 CCID50/0.1 ml to 2.0 log10 CCID50/0.1 ml giving an LRV of 2.0. No cytotoxicity was observed in
any of the test wells and both positive and neutralization controls performed as expected.

Discussion
Iodine is established as having a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacterial, viral, fungal
and protozoal pathogens and has been used as an antiseptic for the prevention of infection and the
treatment of wounds for decades. PVP-I currently has the best antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV (9), and its virucidal in vitro activity against the novel, SARS-CoV-2 virus has been
demonstrated recently (12). This paper aimed to demonstrate that the novel Iodine-V in EID as an
active virucidal ingredient is as efficacious as PVP-I and potentially safer. In vitro virucidal assay in the
present study has indeed demonstrated that 75% and 50% of Essential Iodine Drops (EID) solution
reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus titre after 60 seconds and 90 seconds of incubation by an LRV of 2.0 (99%).

These findings indicate that Iodine-V in EID lends itself as a drug with dual benefits, a mineral
supplement to maintain a healthy thyroid functioning and reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2
virus. When applied orally or intranasally, Iodine-V in EID is potentially beneficial against the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients. This means that the health benefits of EID are
superior to that of PVP-I or Lugol's iodine (iodine and potassium iodide in water alone forming mostly
triiodide).
Although PVP-I was reported to be non-cytotoxic (12), this formulation may cause serious rashes that
are similar to chemical burns observed in a few rare cases. It has been implicated in late-onset allergic
contact dermatitis when used as a pre-operative antiseptic in oral and maxillofacial surgery (15). This
has been attributed to the presence of free iodine (I2), which has a strong oxidizing effect on the skin
or mucosa, hence, the reported allergic reaction. Free iodine concentrations in PVP-I (1.25% dilution)
and Lugol's iodine are regarded as low and safe. The virucidal activity of EID was lower than an LRV
of 4.6 for PVP-I (99.99%) as demonstrated by Pelletier et al. (12), however, 1-5% PVP-I containing
1000-5000 µg/ml iodine compared to 200 µg/ml iodine in EID. Elemental iodine in Iodine-V within the
fulvic acid clathrate complex forming a solid stable material that can be easily formulated into a tablet
form for slow, extended release of elemental iodine. This means that even EID tablet formulation
would be less likely to cause iodine-induced allergies in oral and nasal mucosae. Furthermore, EID is
formulated with Iodine-V without excipients unlike PVP-I and therefore, has a potentially better
virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, PVP-I excipient has been reported, in rare
cases, to induced immediate (type 1) hypersensitivity reactions in children (16). Therefore, EID can be
considered a safer alternative to PVP-I as it can be used in children.
Unlike PVP-I, which is routinely used in surgical settings as a pre-operative antiseptic in oral and
maxillofacial surgery (15), EID is currently used in the general populace as a mineral supplement and
can be readily accepted as a drug to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Being already on
the market as a mineral supplement to help people with iodine deficiency, data on its potential
adverse effects are already known or available and therefore, safe when used routinely orally or
intranasally in known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Conclusion
Iodine-V (currently only available in EID formulation) inactivated 99% of SARS-CoV-2 after 60 and 90
seconds; quite similar to Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) (99.99% at 60 seconds) reported elsewhere. Being
excipient-free, this data also suggests that Iodine-V in EID is likely to have better stability and an
enhanced potency in vivo when compared with PVP-I. Therefore, Iodine-V offers an advantage as a
nasal or oral antiseptic to reduce viral transmission from known or suspected COVID-19 patients. With
the increasing home-based care approach for COVID-19 patients, the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2
virus among family members and the immediate community can be reduced using intranasal/oral
Iodine-V, which has the potential to remove or inactivate shed virus from respiratory secretions of
known or suspected COVID-19 cases.
