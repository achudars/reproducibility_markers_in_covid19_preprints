Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has raised global public health concerns
regarding the current situation and its future evolution. Here we propose an
integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region
and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of
sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model
integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the
zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood
estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic
(R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI
0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region
appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with
possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in
the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of
flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of
importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security,
this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates,
suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for
increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.

  modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the
feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical
feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive
infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell
tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP
progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have
shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation
site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike
(S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and
to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our
larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2
are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease
cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the
viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across
the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or
altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for
virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of
non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.
These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its
ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.

Raman spectroscopy. Both techniques use free space bench-top geometries. Here,
we propose miniaturized on-chip MIR photonics-based aerosol spectroscopy

made of a chalcogenide glass material (Ge23Sb7S70) which shows a broad

will readily complement existing photonic resonator-based particle sizing and

changed. These statements are frequently based on longitudinal data, and the
change in trend is typically found to have occurred at the most recent data
collection time point - if no change had occurred the story is less likely to
be reported. Such claims may potentially influence public health decisions on a
national level.
  We propose two measures for quantifying the trendiness of trends. Assuming
that reality evolves in continuous time we define what constitutes a trend and
a change in trend, and introduce a probabilistic Trend Direction Index. This
index has the interpretation of the probability that a latent characteristic
has changed monotonicity at any given time conditional on observed data. We
also define an index of Expected Trend Instability quantifying the expected
number of changes in trend on an interval.
  Using a latent Gaussian Process model we show how the Trend Direction Index
and the Expected Trend Instability can be estimated in a Bayesian framework and
use the methods to analyze the proportion of smokers in Denmark during the last
20 years, and the development of new COVID-19 cases in Italy from February 24th

States attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies hope to
reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies
affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a
hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to
evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency using passenger count data from
Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and 2018. In
every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the
variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other
words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive. When observing
the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is
inelastic; each additional vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership
than the average bus already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the
elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that
low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to frequency change. This paper can
help transit agencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service
throughout the network. As the quality and availability of passenger count data
improve, this paper can serve as the methodological basis to explore the
dynamics of bus ridership.

  of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a
distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases during the
early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected
for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate.
Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland
China, the scaling law $t^{\mu}$ is surprisingly universal, with a range of
exponents $\mu=2.1\pm0.3$. The universality of this behavior indicates that
despite social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical
heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by
fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological
models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of
containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To
this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of
symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in
response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of
parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases
and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit
the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or
oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of
local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the
observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective
contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a
substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the
implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19
secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent
infectious diseases.

the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of disease? (Q4) What is the
ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity?

time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time
series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at
time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models
and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by
China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed
cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely
predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission
rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that
day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend
our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and
undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is
characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related
to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least
1-1/$R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5) and (Q6), we analyze
the independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration
random graph. By relating the propagation probabilities in the IC model to the
transmission rates and recovering rates in the SIR model, we show 2 approaches
of social distancing that can lead to a reduction of $R_0$.

the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions represents a key chal-lenge. Herein, we
introduce COVID-19 Docking Server, a web server that predicts the binding modes
between COVID-19 targets and the ligands including small molecules, peptides
and anti-bodies. Results: Structures of proteins involved in the virus life
cycle were collected or constructed based on the homologs of coronavirus, and
prepared ready for docking. The meta platform provides a free and interactive
tool for the prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and following
drug discovery for COVID-19.

well-known macroscopic growth laws, the Gompertz law, and the logistic law. We
also propose here a generalization of Gompertz law. Our data analysis permits
an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data
must be compared with the obtained fits, to verify if the spreading is under
control. From our analysis it appears that the spreading reached saturation in
China, due to the strong containment policy of the national government. In
Singapore a large growth rate, recently observed, suggests the start of a new
strong spreading. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the next data on new
infections will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for
lower or higher numbers of infected individuals.

  Meteorological Factors","In this paper, we propose a dynamical model to describe the transmission of
COVID-19, which is spreading in China and many other countries. To avoid a
larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of
strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine
is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to
estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into
seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and
officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model
is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the
transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend
of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role
in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The
control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and
discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is
in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human
transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may
become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the
virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index
is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high
and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail
vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the
effectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the
numerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.

  Prospective","Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in late 2019 and 2020 comprises a serious and
more likely a pandemic threat worldwide. Given that the disease has not
approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or
clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and
creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the
newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and
thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as
ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1
protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based
on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active
site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of
interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory
potency of candidates are as follows
Tipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1
protease inhibitors and Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin for
anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and
the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their
metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for
their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey
by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus

coming summer in the northern hemisphere will reduce the transmission intensity
of COVID-19 with increased humidity and temperature. In this paper, we
investigate this problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates
from January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities, and cases with
confirmed dates from March 15 to April 25 for 1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical
analysis is performed to assess the relationship between the transmissibility
of COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for various
demographic, socio-economic, geographic, healthcare and policy factors and
correcting for cross-sectional correlation. We find a similar influence of the
temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values)
of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries:
one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023
(0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311,
-0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value
by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI
[-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.). If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent
increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the
northern hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by
temperature and 0.20 by humidity). Given the notion that the non-intervened R
values are around 2.5 to 3, only weather factors cannot make the R values below
their critical condition of R<1, under which the epidemic diminishes gradually.
Therefore, public health intervention such as social distancing is crucial to
block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer.

How
different is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become more
virulent? Which animals may be its original host? In this study, we collected
and analyzed nearly thirty thousand publicly available complete genome
sequences for COVID-19 virus from 79 different countries, the previously known
flu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1) and
the lethal, pathogenic viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola,
and Dengue. We found strong similarities between the current circulating
COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins.
On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causing
coronaviruses and the other known viruses. Strikingly, we observed that the
divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased
from December 2019 to May 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in
human hosts. In this paper, we first propose a novel MLCS algorithm NP-MLCS1
for the big sequence analysis, which can calculate the common model for
COVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide important information for vaccine
and antibody development. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolution
trees of the human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strains
from 79 countries. This finding has important implications to the management of
COVID-19 and the development of vaccines and medications.

applied to Italy and South Korea, and forecasts for the forthcoming weeks are

  disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy","Official freely available data about the number of infected at the finest
possible level of spatial areal aggregation (Italian provinces) are used to
model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level.
Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the
first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern
Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series
mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been
implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the
phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide
reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three
subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the
evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission
of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the
effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of
nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in
Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on
the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an
error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level,
instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces
first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the
effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are
currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the
spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed
model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while
controlling for delayed reporting.

mediates its entry through its spike (S) proteins interacting with ACE2
receptors in lung epithelial cells, and may promote an inflammatory response by
means of inflammasome NLRP3 activation and unfolded protein response (these are
possibly consequence of the envelope E protein of COVID-19 virus). Efforts have
been made worldwide to prevent further spread of the disease, but in March 2020
the WHO declared it a pandemic emergency and Mexico started to report its first
cases. In this paper we attempt to summarize the biological features of the
virus and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of its disease, as well as
a stochastic model characterizing the probability distribution of cases in
Mexico by states and the estimated number of cases in Mexico through a
differential equation model (modified SIR model), thus will we be able to
characterize the disease and its course in Mexico in order to display more
preparedness and promote more logical actions by both the policy makers as well
as the general population.

Transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers rendered
intervention and containment of the disease extremely challenging. Based on
reported infection case studies, we construct an epidemiological model that
focuses on transmission around the symptom onset. The model is calibrated
against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the
initial outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical
interventions. Mathematical treatment of the model yields explicit expressions
for the size of latent and pre-symptomatic subpopulations during the
exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic growth rate as input. We then
explore reduction of the basic reproduction number R_0 through specific disease
control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing
masks and sheltering in place. When these measures are implemented in
combination, their effects on R_0 multiply. We also compare our model behaviour
to the first wave of the COVID-19 spreading in various affected regions and
highlight generic and less generic features of the pandemic development.

quarantine has been usually applied between cities, more insight about the
temporal evolution of the disease can be obtained by analyzing the epidemic
within cities, especially the time evolution of the infection, death, and
recovery rates which affected by policies. We study and compare the infection
rate in different cities in China and provinces in Italy and find that the
disease spread is characterized by a two-stages process. At early times, at
order of few days, the infection rate is close to a constant probably due to
the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection symptoms are
observed. Then at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to
quarantines. The time evolution of the death and recovery rates also
distinguish between these two stages and reflect the health system situation
which could be overloaded.

decontamination of locations the infected individual has visited. Achieving
containment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual's

susceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the
recent almost ubiquitous availability of smart phones, many people carry a tool
which can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual's contacts
during an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus crisis.
Unfortunately, the very same first-generation contact tracing tools have been
used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most
private details about individuals. We seek to outline the different
technological approaches to mobile-phone based contact-tracing to date and
elaborate on the opportunities and the risks that these technologies pose to
individuals and societies. We describe advanced security enhancing approaches
that can mitigate these risks and describe trade-offs one must make when
developing and deploying any mass contact-tracing technology. With this paper,
our aim is to continue to grow the conversation regarding contact-tracing for
epidemic and pandemic containment and discuss opportunities to advance this
space. We invite feedback and discussion.

  Case Fatality Rate","The relative case fatality rates (CFRs) between groups and countries are key
measures of relative risk that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical
resource allocation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the middle of an
active outbreak when surveillance data is the primary source of information,
estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time
series of deaths, cases, and recoveries. These include time- and severity-
dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes.
In the context of COVID-19 CFR estimation, we survey such biases and their
potential significance. Further, we analyze theoretically the effect of certain
biases, like preferential reporting of fatal cases, on naive estimators of CFR.
We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that
accounts for time lag and imperfect reporting of deaths and recoveries. We show
that collection of randomized data by testing the contacts of infectious
individuals regardless of the presence of symptoms would mitigate bias by
limiting the covariance between diagnosis and death. Our analysis is

transforms into another metastable phase with a similar free energy as observed

quantitative measure of the efficiency and speed of the adopted containment
policy, which is very helpful not only to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic spread
but also for other countries to choose the best containment policy. The results
show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking

recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access

performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces.
Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep
learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present,
there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end,
this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face
Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD)
and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best
of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face
dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on
which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The
multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95%
accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are

  in Wuhan, China","In a move described as unprecedented in public health history, starting 24
January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a
city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass
quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its
scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using
a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show
that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down
the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) > 1 to
R(t) <1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in
Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected
case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health
policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down
the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in
other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail
spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in
the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March
2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction
number at R(t) <1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures
in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent
increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) >1. Thus, it may be wise
to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which
maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.

  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction","In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

2003.10532v3.txt,0,,1,,python script for fitting the parameters for the reader’s convenience the complete python script for the optimisation of the single parameter α of the simple model is provided on the following page.,2003.10532v3,2020-03-23T20:21:47Z,2020-04-16T15:49:10Z,A simple iterative map forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic,"We develop a simple 3-dimensional iterative map model to forecast the global
spread of the coronavirus disease. Our model contains at most two fitting
parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health
organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that
our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data,
which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down
measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts
exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world
health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$
day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect
approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people,
taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number
of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020),
with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures
can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such
growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades
before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population)
have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down
measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak
in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any
interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the
disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth
pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be
carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world
economy.

  Coronavirus (COVID-19) Detection","Deep Learning has achieved state of the art performance in medical imaging.
However, these methods for disease detection focus exclusively on improving the
accuracy of classification or predictions without quantifying uncertainty in a
decision. Knowing how much confidence there is in a computer-based medical
diagnosis is essential for gaining clinicians trust in the technology and
therefore improve treatment. Today, the 2019 Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infections are a major healthcare challenge around the world. Detecting
COVID-19 in X-ray images is crucial for diagnosis, assessment and treatment.
However, diagnostic uncertainty in the report is a challenging and yet
inevitable task for radiologist. In this paper, we investigate how drop-weights
based Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNN) can estimate uncertainty in
Deep Learning solution to improve the diagnostic performance of the
human-machine team using publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and
show that the uncertainty in prediction is highly correlates with accuracy of
prediction. We believe that the availability of uncertainty-aware deep learning
solution will enable a wider adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a
clinical setting.

  of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak","Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many
lives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime
so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing
borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such
curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being
able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important
but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high
uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence
the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another
factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often
scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand,
finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big
challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been
proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel
selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3)
fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest
possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three
virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed...

  and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with a starting point in
China, has spread rapidly among people living in other countries, and is
approaching approximately 34,986,502 cases worldwide according to the
statistics of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. There are a
limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the
increasing cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic
detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19
spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural
network based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and
Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus
pneumonia infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented
three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal
(healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using 5-fold cross
validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has seen that the
pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance
(96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy
for Dataset-3) among other four used models.

  Analysis Could Contribute in the SARS-CoV-2 Corona Crisis","At the time of writing, the world population is suffering from more than
10,000 registered COVID-19 disease epidemic induced deaths since the outbreak
of the Corona virus more than three months ago now officially known as
SARS-CoV-2. Since, tremendous efforts have been made worldwide to counter-steer
and control the epidemic by now labelled as pandemic. In this contribution, we
provide an overview on the potential for computer audition (CA), i.e., the
usage of speech and sound analysis by artificial intelligence to help in this
scenario. We first survey which types of related or contextually significant
phenomena can be automatically assessed from speech or sound. These include the
automatic recognition and monitoring of breathing, dry and wet coughing or
sneezing sounds, speech under cold, eating behaviour, sleepiness, or pain to
name but a few. Then, we consider potential use-cases for exploitation. These
include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their
development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and
its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide
further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come
to the conclusion that CA appears ready for implementation of (pre-)diagnosis
and monitoring tools, and more generally provides rich and significant, yet so
far untapped potential in the fight against COVID-19 spread.

  disease (COVID-19) and environmental factors based on study of four mostly
  affected places of China and five mostly affected places of Italy","COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated in China in the
month of December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On
31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health
Organization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries
around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing
that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly
investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity
(RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max),
considering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for
four of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai,
Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona,
Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative
humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with

  CoVid-19","The CoVid-19 is spreading pandemically all over the world. A rapid defeat of
the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to
separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of
productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the
common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources,
is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be
examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of
potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad
slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality
rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of
Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate
sample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the
joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients
and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the
first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional
correlation case in function of the infection probability. The
multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered.
Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their
outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or
thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable.
Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular
international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is
growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the
better.

  Anomaly Detection","Cluster of viral pneumonia occurrences during a short period of time may be a
harbinger of an outbreak or pandemic, like SARS, MERS, and recent COVID-19.
Rapid and accurate detection of viral pneumonia using chest X-ray can be
significantly useful in large-scale screening and epidemic prevention,
particularly when other chest imaging modalities are less available. Viral
pneumonia often have diverse causes and exhibit notably different visual
appearances on X-ray images. The evolution of viruses and the emergence of
novel mutated viruses further result in substantial dataset shift, which
greatly limits the performance of classification approaches. In this paper, we
formulate the task of differentiating viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia
and healthy controls into an one-class classification-based anomaly detection
problem, and thus propose the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model,
which consists of a shared feature extractor, an anomaly detection module, and
a confidence prediction module. If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly
detection module is large enough or the confidence score estimated by the
confidence prediction module is small enough, we accept the input as an anomaly
case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage of our approach over binary
classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia classes
explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to reinforce
the one-class model. The proposed model outperforms binary classification
models on the clinical X-VIRAL dataset that contains 5,977 viral pneumonia (no
COVID-19) cases, 18,619 non-viral pneumonia cases, and 18,774 healthy controls.

have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon
catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator
to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are
obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients
with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs
of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but
that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different
compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility
of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments
expanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different
ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs
connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were
measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances,
modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found
discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional
with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway
resistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also
change the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume
controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP
settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test
lungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to
identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the
hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for
mitigating risks.

is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this
study, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks

complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving

findings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business
risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to
distinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on

perceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are
summarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the
industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through

Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different

delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment
is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We
compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a
different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a
Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient
features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients
initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the
best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available
works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but
instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which
allows us to compare both methods. Although the conclusion is reached through
mathematical modeling and is stable upon any reasonable model, this is a
proof-of-concept that should be studied within other expertises before
confronting a real scenario. All calculations, tools and scripts have been made

spread in a given population is developed. It enables the identification of the
key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in
terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended
to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by
Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the
initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of
infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a
`retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the
effectiveness of the control policies adopted.
  The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python
code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They
substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and
adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing
individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as `social/physical
distancing' and population density reduction by strict quarantining are
essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the
pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection
rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart
the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available
available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to

that two nodes are connected decays with their distance as a power law. As the
exponent of the distance dependence grows, model networks smoothly transition
from the random network limit to the regular lattice limit. We show that
despite keeping the average number of contacts constant, the increasing
exponent hampers the epidemic spreading by making long-distance connections
less frequent. The spreading dynamics is influenced by the distance-dependence
exponent as well and changes from exponential growth to power-law growth. The
observed power-law growth is compatible with recent analyses of empirical data
on the spreading of COVID-19 in numerous countries.

  single test on multiple patients","In pandemics or epidemics, public health authorities need to rapidly test a
large number of individuals, both to determine the line of treatment as well as
to know the spread of infection to plan containment, mitigation and future
responses. However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck,
especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where
the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills
and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost
of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for
poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a
test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single
test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample
likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It
thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore,
requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat
increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two
patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test
kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.

  Evidence from Pooled Literature Analysis and Insights from Integrated
  Bioinformatic Analysis","Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of current studies that examined sex
differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify
potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a
systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19. The
objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in
unprecedented fashion. This paper represents a first initiative to achieve this
goal, and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus.
The contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive
models that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of
extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at
answering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world?
What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent,
region, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic
outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a
correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a

further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct

binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly
influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development
of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through
melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other
applications of audible coding of matter include material design by
manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to
broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a

of social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions and lock-downs. Such
measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain for
extended periods. As an alternative, we propose here an alternating quarantine
strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under
lock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of
weekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime affords a dual
partition:\ half of the population interacts for only half of the time,
resulting in a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achieved
by a population-wide lock-down. All the while, it enables socioeconomic
continuity at $50\%$ capacity. The proposed weekly alternations also address an
additional challenge, with specific relevance to COVID-19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2
exhibits a relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience
no symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. Unable to selectively
isolate these invisible spreaders, we resort to population-wide restrictions.
However, under the alternating quarantine routine, if an individual was exposed
during their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will,
in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the
majority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leading
to a rapid decline in the viral spread, thus addressing one of the main
challenges in COVID-19 mitigation.

public health interventions. Our results indicate that public health measures
undertaken in China reduced R from 1.5 in January to 0.4 in mid-March 2020.
They also suggest, however, the limitations of isolation, quarantine, and
large-scale attempts to limit travel. While the world-wide reproduction number
briefly dropped below 1 as China implemented extensive public health measures,
the introduction of the virus to other nations swiftly led to an increasing
world-wide average value of R. In Italy, the nation hardest-hit following
China, social distancing measures brought the local value of R down from 3.71
to 2.51. Nonetheless, the value of R in Italy persisted at levels well above 1,
allowing for ongoing transmission. By mid-March 2020, as COVID-19 spread in
areas without extensive public health interventions in place, the world-wide
value of R increased to a level similar to that of late January.

total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission.
However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for
France). By setting the end of intervention as the day when hospital capacity
is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up
to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results
pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after

  Package with Consideration for Ageing Population and Time Delay for Control
  Action and Resusceptibility","The current global health emergency triggered by the pandemic COVID-19 is one
of the greatest challenges mankind face in this generation. Computational
simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the
current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future
projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control
action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a
well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral
diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola,
SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with
additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility,
where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the
current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death,
recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also
considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time
delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as
well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge
variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims
to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the
spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be
better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for
verification and prediction studies, based on the real-world data in South
Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.

high infection rate, leaving more than one million infected people around the

compared to the SARS-CoV-1, in order to suppress this high infection rate. Some
of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein
might be responsible for its higher affinity to the ACE2 human cell receptor.
In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling
to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger
than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The
major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from
the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417
and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution
from a single mutant to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce
sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies. Our results
also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely a lab engineered virus.

computed tomography (CT) plays an essential role in the global fight against
COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical
specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical
imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image
acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also
reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best
protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by
accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating
subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help
radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking,
and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of
medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image
acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on
the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the
frontline hospitals, in order to depict the latest progress of medical imaging
and radiology fighting against COVID-19.

  among COVID-19 cases in Germany: evidence of lesser adherence to social
  distancing practices?","Background: There is uncertainty about the role of different age groups in
propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries. Methods: We used
the Koch Institute data on COVID-19 cases in Germany. To minimize the effect of
changes in healthcare seeking behavior and testing practices, we included the
following 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each
age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g
among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period),
as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period),
and the relative risk RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a
higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2) is interpreted as the relative
increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 for g1 compared to g2 for
the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk was highest for
individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals
aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged
25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y

(RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y)
among COVID-19 cases is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood
of seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups
compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the
German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among
individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age
groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.

public policy to mitigate the pandemic is \emph{social and physical
distancing}: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home,
closing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal
evidences suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease
mitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social
distancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound
manner.

varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these

  Cases at the Era of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first
symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly
spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus
pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary
infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates
deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with
the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the
COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets,
deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from
publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are
proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is
assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context
have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply
health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting
patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show
possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest
X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of
COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models
retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators
is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections
and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.

large-scale action by many actors across sectors, to mobilise resources,

innovations from complex epidemiological models, AI, to open data platforms for
prevention, diagnostic and treatment. Amongst the many challenges during a
pandemic, innovation and manufacturing stakeholders find themselves engaged in
new relationships, and are likely to face intellectual property (IP) related
challenges. This paper adopts an IP perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic to
identify pandemic related IP considerations and IP challenges. The focus is on
challenges related to research, development and urgent upscaling of capacity to
manufacture CC-Products in the huge volumes suddenly in demand. Its purpose is
to provide a structure for steering clear of IP challenges to avoid delays in
fighting a pandemic. We identify 4 stakeholder groups concerned with IP
challenges: (i) governments, (ii) organisations owning existing Crisis-Critical
IP, described as incumbents in Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), (iii)
manufacturing firms from other sectors normally not producing CC-Products
suddenly rushing into CC-Sectors to support the manufacturing of CC-Products
(new entrants), and (iv) voluntary grassroot initiatives that are formed during
a pandemic. This paper discusses IP challenges related to the development and
manufacturing of technologies and products for (i) prevention (of spread), (ii)
diagnosis of infected patients and (iii) the development of treatments. We

by fitting the parameters of a compartmental model to empirical data, and
running the model forward with modified parameters that account for a specific
measure. This approach has several drawbacks, stemming from biases or lack of
availability of data and instability of parameter estimates. Here we take the
opposite approach -- that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we
reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess
the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process.
This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the
evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on
parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using
this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing
outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy. This gives an estimate of how many infected
could have been avoided had preventive quarantine been enforced at a given
time.

  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by
various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2
causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social
distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this
end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized
(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and
analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous
complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is
necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is
insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with
the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy
at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees
to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that
stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the
outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for
the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus
reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find
that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the
adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a
region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an
understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our
investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into
understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak
infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to
understand and control over an extended period of time.

importantly, how the public reacts to them. Here, we examine informationseeking

an eventstudy framework, we show that such news increases collective attention
to the crisis right away, but the elevated level of attention is short-lived,
even though the initial announcements were followed by increasingly strong
measures. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their
state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by
searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms and hand sanitizer. On the other
hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g.,
quarantine, school closures, testing), or personal health strategies (e.g.,
masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be
immediately triggered by first reports. These results are encouraging given our

responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis will
track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.

Previous studies showed both virus and host-derived MicroRNAs (miRNAs) played
crucial roles in the pathology of virus infection. In this study, we use
computational approaches to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome for putative miRNAs and
predict the virus miRNA targets on virus and human genome as well as the host
miRNAs targets on virus genome. Furthermore, we explore miRNAs involved
dysregulation caused by the virus infection. Our results implicated that the
immune response and cytoskeleton organization are two of the most notable
biological processes regulated by the infection-modulated miRNAs. Impressively,
we found hsa-miR-4661-3p was predicted to target the S gene of SARS-CoV-2, and
a virus-encoded miRNA MR147-3p could enhance the expression of TMPRSS2 with the
function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut. The study may
provide important clues for the mechisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep
Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19
cases using chest X-rays.
  Methods
  In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model
to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The
proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet
dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and
other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available
databases.
  Results and Conclusion
  CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the
experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy
of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases
are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia
viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal),
the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary
results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more
training data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially
advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic,
it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid
them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.

  factors in developing human embryos","To predict if developing human embryos are permissive to coronaviruses, we
analyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell,
8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm
for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein
cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes
involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2,
BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst
including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are
co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the
trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for
proteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We
identified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are
enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are
common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid
metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
Together our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive
to coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they
also express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and
replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient
management for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  will help COVID-19 containment","The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of
virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the
phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are
progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence.
For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale
adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the
app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens'
privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the
need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We
advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both
contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens'
""personal data stores"", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily,
only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy
preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal
sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed
information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and,
in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak
hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is
two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light
touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the
device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when
they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second,
we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision,
giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure
they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for
rebuilding society.

spread to multiple countries and infected thousands of people. Such diseases
spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities
recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast
population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace
contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information
such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third
party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known
locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile
contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of
infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other
personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to
allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short
distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected,
and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees
provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace
dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows
that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an
infected user by turning on the app during active times.

  For droplet sizes larger than $100\,\mu m$, computing the time of decay to

  Patterns Detection in X-ray Images","Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, is nowadays one of the most prominent
challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus
propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The
standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to
the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening
methods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing
promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these
methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and
availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet
efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of
COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective
we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural
networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other
applications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a
hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed
approaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the
three classes were used to assess the quality of the methods. Results: The
results show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality
model, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and
positive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters
than other than the other tested architectures. Larger and more heterogeneous
databases are still needed for validation before claiming that deep learning
can assist physicians in the task of detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images.

worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out
jointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative
case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only demands
collecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the
tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with
population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population
controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that
test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population
controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic
persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory
infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal
magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be
identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to
compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional
case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups:
one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn
from existing country-wide health care databases. We also describe other
possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population
controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures
that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and
exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be
applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of non-epidemic disease.

  complex network analysis to the successful case of Greece","Within the context that Greece promises a success story in the fight against
the disease, this paper proposes a novel method to study the evolution of the
Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation to the anti-COVID-19 policies
applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of COVID-19 and
the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis
builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19
infection-curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization
algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining
periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal
a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting
with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern
intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending
up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek
COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also
illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes,
implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and
high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The
overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel
method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better
forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices
and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the
war against COVID-19.

  Classification from CT Images","An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded
in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic
around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also
be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in
Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness
may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and
progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden
standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.
Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources
may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such
circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis
and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly
supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of
manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection
detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the
promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a
wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.

for the U.S. economy associated with the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of
individual occupations and industries. To analyze the supply shock, we classify
industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labor Index,
which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand
shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic
developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID
period, these shocks would threaten around 22% of the US economy's GDP,
jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry
level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by
demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are
more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and
tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show
that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and
demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We
should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks -- we expect them
to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.

  Respiratory Infections such as COVID-19 on Portable Device","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global epidemic in
the past few months and caused huge loss to human society worldwide. For such a
large-scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers
is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that
one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by
viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce
the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable
non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks
through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists
of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those
potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection
in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through
the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode
camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data
capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a
bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the
respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of
validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on
respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal
respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin
Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other
normal respiratory data are obtained from healthy people around our
researchers. This work demonstrates that the proposed portable and intelligent
health screening device can be used as a pre-scan method for respiratory
infections, which may help fight the current COVID-19 epidemic.

desirable owing to adverse social, psychological, and economic consequences of
a complete or near-complete lockdown. Adopting a social network approach, we
evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to
'keep the curve flat' and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are
limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts, seeking similarity across
contacts, and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate
stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection
models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event
models. We demonstrate that strategic reduction of contact can strongly
increase the efficiency of social distancing measures, introducing the
possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. This
approach provides nuanced insights to policy makers for effective social
distancing that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.

  and Segmentation","Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic
disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the
infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial
step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high
enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a
valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the
patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan
test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This
paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to
perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS
system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation
(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and
350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with
fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased
attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,
opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is
very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an
average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification
test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS
dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at

prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that
facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally
identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app
allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with
no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for

verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and
digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive

in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For
the test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and

  in CT Scans","Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for
regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution
neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are
still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of
convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their
borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways,
and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a
critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are
affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD.
  In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages
structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network
module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships
among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights.
  With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we
initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the
COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models
pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate
RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).
Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and
performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.

  Pandemic: An Autonomous Logistic Vehicle for Contactless Goods Transportation","Since early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly
across the world. As at the date of writing this article, the disease has been
globally reported in 223 countries and regions, infected over 108 million
people and caused over 2.4 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/, accessed
on Feb. 17, 2021). Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an effective
approach to control and prevent the pandemic. However, many daily activities,
such as transporting goods in our daily life, inevitably involve
person-to-person contact. Using an autonomous logistic vehicle to achieve
contact-less goods transportation could alleviate this issue. For example, it
can reduce the risk of virus transmission between the driver and customers.
Moreover, many countries have imposed tough lockdown measures to reduce the
virus transmission (e.g., retail, catering) during the pandemic, which causes
inconveniences for human daily life. Autonomous vehicle can deliver the goods
bought by humans, so that humans can get the goods without going out. These
demands motivate us to develop an autonomous vehicle, named as Hercules, for

  Measures in the Presence of Infection Hotspots","Multiple lines of evidence at the individual and population level strongly
suggest that infection hotspots, or superspreading events, where a single
individual infects many others, play a key role in the transmission dynamics of
COVID-19. However, most of the existing epidemiological models either assume or
result in a Poisson distribution of the number of infections caused by a single
infectious individual, often called secondary infections. As a result, these
models overlook the observed overdispersion in the number of secondary
infections and are unable to accurately characterize infection hotspots. In
this work, we aim to fill this gap by introducing a temporal point process
framework that explicitly represents sites where infection hotspots may occur.
Under our model, overdispersion on the number of secondary infections emerges
naturally. Moreover, using an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how
to apply Bayesian optimization with longitudinal case data to estimate the
transmission rate of infectious individuals at sites they visit and in their
households, as well as the mobility reduction due to social distancing.
Simulations using fine-grained demographic data and site locations from several
cities and regions demonstrate that our framework faithfully characterizes the
observed longitudinal trend of COVID-19 cases. In addition, the simulations
show that our model can be used to estimate the effect of testing, contact
tracing, and containment at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, and
reveal that these measures do not decrease overdispersion in the number of
secondary infections.

quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and

technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help
limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and
enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures. In this paper, we

confirmed that this virus has taken over 126,607 lives until today. Since the
beginning of its spreading, many Artificial Intelligence researchers developed
systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the
infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to
COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large
number of patients in hospitals, it would be time-consuming and difficult to
examine lots of X-ray images, so it can be very useful to develop an AI network
that does this job automatically. In this paper, we have trained several deep
convolutional networks with the introduced training techniques for classifying
X-ray images into three classes: normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19, based on two
open-source datasets. Unfortunately, most of the previous works on this subject
have not shared their dataset, and we had to deal with few data on covid19
cases. Our data contains 180 X-ray images that belong to persons infected to
COVID-19, so we tried to apply methods to achieve the best possible results. In
this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network
learn better when we have few cases of COVID-19, and also we propose a neural
network that is a concatenation of Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This
network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by
two robust networks. In this paper, despite some other researches, we have
tested our network on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy our network
can achieve in real circumstances. The average accuracy of the proposed network

  Locations to Identify Susceptible Infections in Simulated Epidemics","Amidst an increasing number of infected cases during the Covid-19 pandemic,
it is essential to trace, as early as possible, the susceptible people who
might have been infected by the disease due to their close proximity with
people who were tested positive for the virus. This early contact tracing is
likely to limit the rate of spread of the infection within a locality. In this
paper, we investigate how effectively and efficiently can such a list of
susceptible people be found given a list of infected persons and their
locations. To address this problem from an information retrieval (search)
perspective, we represent the location of each person at each time instant as a
point in a vector space. By using the locations of the given list of infected
persons as queries, we investigate the feasibility of applying approximate
nearest neighbour (ANN) based indexing and retrieval approaches to obtain a
list of top-k suspected users in real-time. Since leveraging information from
true user location data can lead to security and privacy concerns, we also
investigate what effects does distance-preserving encoding methods have on the
effectiveness of the ANN methods. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that the top-k retrieved lists of susceptible users
retrieved with existing ANN approaches (KD-tree and HNSW) yield satisfactory
precision and recall values, thus indicating that ANN approaches can
potentially be applied in practice to facilitate real-time contact tracing even
under the presence of imposed privacy constraints.

  from the fatality time series in COVID-19 outbreaks","In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures,
including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of
immense interest. Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic
errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of
empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In
this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a
master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic
reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection
rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable
differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities.
We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows
this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic
growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic
reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the
outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The
difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the
separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal
variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model
remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.

how this model can provide an insight of what the level of infection in the

probably higher due to the change in the possibilities of performing massive
number of tests to the general population. The number of forecasted deaths for
that date is 46,000 +/- 15,000. The model also predicts the level of infection
at the different Spanish regions, providing a counterintuitive result in the
cases of Madrid and Catalonia as the result shows a higher the level of

of these results can be used to guide policy makers in order to optimize

the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results
can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their

networks. Here, the real-space urban life of people is modeled as a scale-free
network with constraints. A scale-free network has been adopted for modeling
on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent
peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted
reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three
findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the
peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get
reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all
members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other
people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its
effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group
meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may
temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but
it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy
is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W
to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is
set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of
infections according to the result.

new COVID-19 infections (the most important information in order to establish
the effect of containment strategies) from available aggregated data, such as
number of deaths and hospitalizations. The method, that was used for HIV-AIDS
and was named `back-calculation', relies on good estimates of the distribution
of the delays between infection and the observed events; assuming that the
epidemic follows a simple SIR model with a known generation interval, we can
then estimate the parameters that define the time-varying contact rate through
maximum likelihood. We show the application of the method to data from Italy
and several of its region; it is found that $R_0$ had decreased consistently
below 1 around March 20, and in the beginning of April it was between 0.5 and
0.8 in the whole Italy and in most regions.

  purely non-pharmaceutical interventions","When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine and
far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies to
prevent the spread of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and continuous-time optimal
control theory, we compute the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy
for the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment
(eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal control
must meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related
deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural
immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave.
Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at a
minimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a
single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated
interventions and simple ""flattening of the curve."" Careful analysis of the
computed control strategy reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in
fact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where
socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced
against one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial
exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

  education","This study explores the effects of COVID-19 confinement in the students
performance in higher education. Using a field experiment of 458 students from
three different subjects in Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain), we study
the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of
the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect
of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also
significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in
their learning performance.

Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently
spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and
citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States
healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm
the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and
states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social
distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the
curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people
hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given
that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we
model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the
theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates.
With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the
peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how
aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the
capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve
impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time
of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical
evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the
insights from the model.

strengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)
it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical
deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private

suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide

  disordered multiplex networks","The frequent emergence of diseases with the potential to become threats at
local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently
COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease
propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations.
Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context,
especially in human contact networks, here we examine the
susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex
network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a
fraction $q$ of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through
weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or
disordered); weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using
branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing
strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the
intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find
that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic
can be prevented, increase with the overlap $q$. Also we study the effect of
the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals,
which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find
that for relatively small values of the overlap $q$, social distancing policies
might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.

  respiratory droplets and their role in Covid-19 outbreaks","One of the many unresolved questions that revolves around the Covid-19
pandemic is whether local outbreaks can depend on ambient conditions like
temperature and relative humidity. In this paper, we develop a model that tries
to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of
respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral
outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the
infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of
which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the
pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound
physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision
rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In
the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for
disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation
time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally
crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the
experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of
pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model.
Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature
and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions. Since
the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient

  interventions on COVID-19 in European countries: technical description update","Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread
outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many
European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical
interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and
universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most
recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns.
  In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of
infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive
number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these
interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in
behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from
temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of
transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic
time lag between infection and death.
  In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al
2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation
effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more
balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown
intervention covariate. We also (e) included another 3 countries (Greece, the
Netherlands and Portugal).

  pandemic, March 2020 to May 2020","Official counts of COVID-19 deaths have been criticized for potentially
including people who did not die of COVID-19 but merely died with COVID-19. I
address that critique by fitting a generalized additive model to weekly counts
of all deaths registered in England and Wales during the 2010s. The model
produces baseline rates of death registrations expected without the COVID-19
pandemic, and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths
exposes the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. By April's end,
England and Wales registered 45,300 $\pm$ 3200 excess deaths of adults aged
45+. Through 22 May, the last day of available all-deaths data, 56,600 $\pm$
4400 were registered (about 53% of which were of men). Both the ONS's
corresponding count of 43,205 death certificates which mention COVID-19, and
the Department of Health and Social Care's count of 33,671 deaths, are
appreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated, not
overestimated, the pandemic's true death toll. If underreporting rates have
held steady during May, about 59,000 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might
have been registered through the end of May but not yet publicly reported in
full.

changing trends and provide extremely accurate predictions of confirmed cases
at the level of countries and states of the United States. We show that during
the earlier part of the epidemic, using travel data increases the predictions.
Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics of the
epidemic. In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can
help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic.
The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such
as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.

  Screening for COVID-19","Background: Rapid testing for an infection is paramount during a pandemic to
prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample
pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2.
  Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six
different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate,
test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations
in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19
outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and
testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised
prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of
cases identified; and number of false positives.
  Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input
parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen
one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when
prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised
testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the
US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight
times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are
considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex
pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also
reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%.
  Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for
adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of
testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily
wastes valuable time and resources.

of the epidemic and another model for an interpretation of the entire data set.
Both models agree reasonably with the data. It is shown by the first model that
during the fast phase, the number of new infected cases depends on the total
number of cases by a power-law relation with a scaling exponent equal to 0.82.
The second model gives a duplication time in the range 1 to 3 days early in the

plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the
existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are
impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists
are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare
current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different
datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics.
Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in
this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based
on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas,
e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a
fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard
training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the
corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide
more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as
out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for
researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We
achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3\%, 97.7\%, and
67.3\% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6\%, 91.4\%, and
70.0\% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. Conclusions: To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning
benchmark for medical image segmentation and the largest number of pre-trained
models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays
the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for
efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.

focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose
models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it
can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared,
especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason
for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different
regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical
area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social
coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the
epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an
important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model
for epidemics, which especially takes into account pandemic situations. To the
best of our knowledge, this model is first of its kind, which takes into
account the population distribution and connectivity of different geographic
locations across the globe. In addition to presenting the mathematical proof of

large human group worldwide and the assessment of the infection rate in the
lung is essential for treatment planning. This research aims to propose a

multi-thresholding, image separation using threshold filter,
feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion and classification. The
initial part implements the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA+KE)
thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into
two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these
images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures.
Finally, a two-class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen
CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID-19 group. In
this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with

  infection-dependent mitigation strategies","Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks may vary over time depending on the
societal response. Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social
distancing and the adoption of protective equipment aim precisely at reducing
transmission rates by reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects
of mitigation strategies on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission
rates that are influenced by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries
have been included in many variants of the classical SIR model. This class of
models is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the
population behavior has been affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid
distribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This
manuscript revisits a SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is
due to knowledge of infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes
individuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a
time-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through
a negative feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in
ecology and Michaelis-Menten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A
step-by-step derivation of the model is provided, together with an overview of
methods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback
structurally reduces the peak of infections. At the same time, feedback may
substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. Computational simulations
agree with the analytical predictions, and further suggest that infection peak
reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. If the
mitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter
is added to the SIR model, making it useful to illustrate the effects of
infection-dependent social distancing.

as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced
mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users
with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random
tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'
phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to
learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been
diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end
privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these
approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token
metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users.
  In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing
with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their
contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of
users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides
protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new
cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality
(PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the
intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We
specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients
have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.

its emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. We discuss the effect of
nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the
spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is
used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of
nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its
removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the
peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020.
We also predict a 7$\%$ to 21$\%$ increase in the peak value of active infected
cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation
in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown
period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a
non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to
prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public
health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat,
it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health
and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their
economies.

digital technologies, focusing on their influence in the industrial and social
fields. More specifically we used the blogging platform ""Medium"", which has
seen an exponential growth in its production of articles over the last couple
of months. Even if different from esteemed scientific sources, this platform
provides a structure that suits our analysis. We searched how many times
digital technologies are mentioned in articles regarding Coronavirus and, after
collecting these articles, we collected page tags (comparable to ""keywords"" in
scientific articles) and classified them (technology tags and non-technology
tags), to create a graph showing the relation between them. This network
allowed us to acknowledge and picture how technologies are currently debated.
This was the starting point to discuss the key implications for an imminent
future, and question about the impact on industry, society and labour market.
What are the opportunities or threats of using technologies of Industry 4.0?
Which are the needs rising because of the pandemic and how can technologies
help in their fulfillment? How will the industrial scenario change after this

has affected global energy use and CO2 emissions. Here we show the
unprecedented decrease in global fossil CO2 emissions from January to April
2020 was of 7.8% (938 Mt CO2 with a +6.8% of 2-{\sigma} uncertainty) when
compared with the period last year. In addition other emerging estimates of
COVID impacts based on monthly energy supply or estimated parameters, this
study contributes to another step that constructed the near-real-time daily CO2
emission inventories based on activity from power generation (for 29
countries), industry (for 73 countries), road transportation (for 406 cities),
aviation and maritime transportation and commercial and residential sectors
emissions (for 206 countries). The estimates distinguished the decline of CO2
due to COVID-19 from the daily, weekly and seasonal variations as well as the
holiday events. The COVID-related decreases in CO2 emissions in road
transportation (340.4 Mt CO2, -15.5%), power (292.5 Mt CO2, -6.4% compared to
2019), industry (136.2 Mt CO2, -4.4%), aviation (92.8 Mt CO2, -28.9%),
residential (43.4 Mt CO2, -2.7%), and international shipping (35.9Mt CO2,
-15%). Regionally, decreases in China were the largest and earliest (234.5 Mt
CO2,-6.9%), followed by Europe (EU-27 & UK) (138.3 Mt CO2, -12.0%) and the U.S.
(162.4 Mt CO2, -9.5%). The declines of CO2 are consistent with regional
nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based
networks, but the calculated signal of emissions decreases (about 1Gt CO2) will
have little impacts (less than 0.13ppm by April 30, 2020) on the overserved
global CO2 concertation. However, with observed fast CO2 recovery in China and
partial re-opening globally, our findings suggest the longer-term effects on
CO2 emissions are unknown and should be carefully monitored using multiple
measures.

used by frontline health-care workers, and are typically meant for one-time
usage. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage
of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and
re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of
N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene
electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic
effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple
decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining
charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration
efficiency post decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on
the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and
filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and show that it
is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration
efficiency.

the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung
infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to
augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However,
segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including
high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between
infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is
impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep
model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection
Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify
infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial

Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized
to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate
the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation
framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only
requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our
semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher

reduced sociality as measured through mobility features, and increased virtual
sociality through phone usage. People were more active on their phones,
spending more time using social media apps, particularly around major news
events. Furthermore, participants had lower heart rate, went to bed later, and
slept more. We also found that young people had longer homestay than older
people during lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant

the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Current predictive
models of the development of COVID-19, especially after mitigation efforts, are
largely based on extrapolating the data from other countries. Since most states
enforced stay-at-home orders towards the end of March, their effect should be
reflected in the death and infection counts at the end of April. Using the data
available until April 25th, we investigate the change in the infection rate due
to the mitigation efforts, and project death and infection counts until
September, 2020, for some of the most heavily impacted states: New York, New
Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and Louisiana. We find that with the
current mitigation efforts five of those six states reduce their reproduction
number to a value less than one, stopping the exponential growth of the
pandemic. We also projected different scenarios after the mitigation is
relaxed. Analysis for other states can be found at

information, to study the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility. The study
revealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles
traveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all
showed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The
trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics
started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a
portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing
voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,
after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite
the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a
natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the
extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national
data showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S.
states and for all the studied statistics. The U.S. states showed a

precipitation, wind speed and the specific government policy intervention of
partial lockdown on the new cases of COVID-19 infection in Ghana. Daily data on
confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were obtained

Considering the nature of the data and the objectives of the study, a time
series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on past
observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model
fitting. The results indicate significant effects of maximum temperature,
relative humidity and precipitation in predicting new cases of the disease.
Also, results of the intervention analysis indicate that the null hypothesis of
no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown
should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5\% level of significance. These
findings provide useful insights for policymakers and the public.

This result can then be converted to a determination of the infection fatality

London, somewhat lower than usually assumed. Alternatively, the result can also
be interpreted as an effectively larger fraction of the population than simple

advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an
existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been

distancing and some states, e.g., Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already
began to practice less social distancing despite the high increasing speed of
confirmed cases; 4) some counties with the highest infection rates are not

intermediate step. We also suggested a novelty called output neuron keeping,
which changes the twice transfer learning technique. In order to clarify the

  WiFi Datasets","Contact tracing has emerged as one of the main mitigation strategies to
prevent the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. Recently, several efforts
have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions
using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and
smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially
violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g.,
GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use
personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers
organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for
social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive
and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees
and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties.
Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure
protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's
location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately
identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then
informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled
applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of
people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise
exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and
implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest. We, also,
validate the practicality of Quest and evaluate it thoroughly via an actual
campus-scale deployment at UC Irvine over a very large dataset of over 50M
tuples.

intra-group and via inter-group interactions. Our results emphasize the
importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of
substantial flattening and delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with
concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To
exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10)
noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a
stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections
reduced and postponed in time by the same factor $m$ (5 or 10). More generally,
our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus
spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling
between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure
reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g.,
large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools,
(seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the
proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more
bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone. Last but not least, the

validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control
policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to
simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more
realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy
that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a
reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant
parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using
interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and
safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are
inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social
distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing
that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the

number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of
social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social

opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.

Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an
essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive
clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the
severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the
lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this
end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity
assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe
segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few
infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we
first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image
patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance
deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of
COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet
consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe
segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a
unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context
information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the
performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a
real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results
suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

  Rate in an Infectious Disease like Covid-19","Covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damage
amounting to trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid development
of vaccine. Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question
on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely
focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk
groups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space,
which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate.
To demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describing
the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, for
infectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns,
locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers $R_0\sim 1.5-4$
the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations
compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to
the population density. For $R_0\sim 1$ we still find a significant increase of
the survival rate. The proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be further
tested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on the
importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official
guidelines.

return to their native places. Arranging transportation could spike the number

in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection and assesses the train and
bus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The expected to
repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011
census data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A
modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to
estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in
India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model
considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of
migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the
origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily
arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants
(i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and
active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days
needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence,
travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar, about 50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day
to Maharashtra and less than 20,000 per day to other states of India was

  X-ray images with novel deep learning model","Background: Novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide. As recent
radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on
CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable
chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of
Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully
automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and
evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep
learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was
developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection
of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest
x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and
Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data,
the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is,
100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the
model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the
accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this
indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set
of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open
source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%,
respectively.

  Policy Responses to COVID-19","This paper uses transaction data from a large bank in Scandinavia to estimate
the effect of social distancing laws on consumer spending in the COVID-19
pandemic. The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects
of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were
similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant
restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate
spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the
shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most
of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless
of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggest that
social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low
health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering
the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.

some information about community-level activity, dense distributed geophysical
sensing of ground motions across a city are more complete and also natively
anonymous. In this paper, we demonstrate how fiber-optic Distributed Acoustic
Sensing (DAS) connected to a telecommunication cable beneath Palo Alto, CA
captured seismic and geodetic signals produced by vehicles during the COVID-19

of roadbed deformation caused by local cars and trucks in an automatic template
matching detection algorithm to count the number of vehicles traveling per day
over a two-month period around the timing of the San Francisco Bay Area

immediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a

deaths and infected people. Although governments all over the world have taken
severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel
restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities,
quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot
more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has
reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by
undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous
other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of
symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not
representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is
expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main
factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major
reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To
contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT
(Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to
spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the
authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if
they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all
persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients.
Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control
over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.

  COVID-19?","Smartphone-based electronic contact tracing is currently considered an
essential tool towards easing lockdowns, curfews, and shelter-in-place orders
issued by most governments around the world in response to the 2020 novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. While the focus on developing smartphone-based
contact tracing applications or apps has been on privacy concerns stemming from
the use of such apps, an important question that has not received sufficient
attention is: How reliable will such smartphone-based electronic contact
tracing be?
  This is a technical question related to how two smartphones reliably register
their mutual proximity. Here, we examine in detail the technical prerequisites
required for effective smartphone-based contact tracing. The underlying
mechanism that any contact tracing app relies on is called Neighbor Discovery
(ND), which involves smartphones transmitting and scanning for Bluetooth
signals to record their mutual presence whenever they are in close proximity.
The hardware support and the software protocols used for ND in smartphones,
however, were not designed for reliable contact tracing. In this paper, we
quantitatively evaluate how reliably can smartphones do contact tracing. Our
results point towards the design of a wearable solution for contact tracing
that can overcome the shortcomings of a smartphone-based solution to provide
more reliable and accurate contact tracing. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study that quantifies, both, the suitability and also the
drawbacks of smartphone-based contact tracing. Further, our results can be used
to parameterize a ND protocol to maximize the reliability of any contact
tracing app that uses it.

  Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital","Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as
""seasonal viruses"" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words,
meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this
information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In
this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals
in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from
patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We
propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of
positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds
of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these
distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations
to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological
conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar
variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings
highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a
related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under
different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be
easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced
approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as
those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is
at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the
proposed method is assessed through a simulation study.

due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To
evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic
model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household
income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a
crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can
use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period,
when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level.
The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a
lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance
(UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of
three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9%
in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income
earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the
combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero,
and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income
loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is
spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the
average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a
first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional
scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect
macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making
and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural
disasters).

new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically
changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly
to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments,
scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources
available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories,
to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this
paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining
advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend
analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for
quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two
recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the
Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information
including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain
initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical
topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories
through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and
automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our
methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery
systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid
scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues
in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

  intervention under ICU sustainability","We consider here an extended SIR model, including several features of the
recent COVID-19 outbreak: in particular the infected and recovered individuals
can either be detected (+) or undetected (-) and we also integrate an intensive
care unit (ICU) capacity. Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis
of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both
lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based
on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various
quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off
between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with
the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as
an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong
lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a
short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to
normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal
scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is
released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures
with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on
detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are
introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing
can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals
to be more moderate.

  quantitative perspective","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a variable
clinical presentation that ranges from asymptomatic, to severe disease with
cytokine storm. The mortality rates also differ across the globe, ranging from
0.5-13%. This variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host
factors may include genetic differences in the immune response genes as well as
variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better understand what impact these
genetic variants in immune response genes may have in the differences observed
in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical
systems model that considers both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the
subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve control of
infection is considered. Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be
posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations
of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses.
In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells
infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive
response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral
replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of the innate and adaptive
immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in
variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may
alter the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to develop successful
treatment strategies.

  models","Several analytical models have been used in this work to describe the
evolution of death cases arising from coronavirus (COVID-19). The Death or `D'
model is a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)
model, which assumes no recovery over time, and allows for the
transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically. The D-model can be
extended to describe various focuses of infection, which may account for the
original pandemic (D1), the lockdown (D2) and other effects (Dn). The evolution
of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China, Spain, Italy, France, UK,
Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model
trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow
decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown
effect. These results are in agreement with more accurate calculations using
the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more sophisticated
Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a
common evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.

individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed

epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay.
Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical
models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing
the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an
algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where
$T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show
how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic
data and estimate some epidemic parameters. Note that although the model shows
a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the
real size of the pandemics as the relation of the observed reported data to the
total number of infected in the population is still unknown.

behavior change in people's responses to infectious disease outbreaks
(particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we propose a heterogeneous
Disease-Behavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model, in which people's risk
of getting infected is influenced by information diffusion, behavior change,
and disease transmission. We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte
Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion
influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and
adopt self-protection, and subsequently affects disease transmission by
changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a
central role in epidemic prevention; (b) a reasonable fraction of
""over-reacting"" nodes are needed in epidemic prevention; (c) R0 has different
effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection;
(d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic
outbreak size. This research indicates that the media and opinion leaders
should not understate the transmissibility and severity of diseases to ensure
that people could become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection to
protect themselves and the whole population.

  to estimate the total cases from medical swabs data?","During the current Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, official data are collected
with medical swabs following a pure convenience criterion which, at least in an
early phase, has privileged the exam of patients showing evident symptoms.
However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients
(e. g. Aguilar et al., 2020; Chugthai et al, 2020; Li, et al., 2020; Mizumoto
et al., 2020a, 2020b and Yelin et al., 2020). In this situation, in order to
estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it
should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it
would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw
sound probabilistic inference. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total
prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time
series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic
in earlier time (Brogi et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose to estimate the
prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data
published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\`a so as to obtain a more
representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure
commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a
distribution which is more similar to the population (Valliant et al., 2018).
In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order
to derive the weights necessary for reweighting them using age and gender as
post-stratification variables thus obtaining more reliable estimation of
prevalence and lethality.

measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible -
Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the
evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the
best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with
two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic
Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter
distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system
focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that
hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding
taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage
to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid
tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of
a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep
Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the
sequences of actions.

  measures","In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of
asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to
contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the
population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by
separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep
working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group
consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to
quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.
In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of
contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in
time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an
explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms
of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we
can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the
epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic
scenarios. From the expression of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we
conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic
cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these
measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved.
Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce
their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to
maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.

essential prerequisite for appropriate crisis management during adverse health

primary responsibility of risk management is not centralized to a single

Twitter data in descriptive or predictive context during COVID-19 pandemic,
causal modeling of public attention has not been investigated. In this study,
we propose a causal inference approach to discover and quantify causal
relationships between pandemic characteristics (e.g. number of infections and
deaths) and Twitter activity as well as public sentiment. Our results show that
the proposed method can successfully capture the epidemiological domain
knowledge and identify variables that affect public attention and sentiment. We

potential inhibitors for the five therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2,
i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), SGp-RBD (spike

isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on
tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and
only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of
the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests
for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the
outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions
emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded)
relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is
unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on
the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists
no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring
or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing
policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any
second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is
within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and
tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000
tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for
which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative
analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent
serological studies.

  case study","An epidemiological model is developed for the spread of COVID-19 in South
Africa. A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP
model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global
COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the
SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South
Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their
peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by
when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then
used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the
initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability
of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently
recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values.
The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be
reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the
number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October
2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to
90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are
heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence
to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly
sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The
future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South
African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying
lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.

to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems
are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of
SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical
ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on
healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we
study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and
based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to

To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a
retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of
5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models
identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a

discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence

  disease risk and severity' and how causal Bayesian networks both expose and
  resolve the problem","An important recent preprint by Griffith et al highlights how 'collider bias'
in studies of COVID19 undermines our understanding of the disease risk and
severity. This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who
have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are
overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being
underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results
that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of
Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret
observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved
using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that
there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which,
unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in
this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset
and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely
that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases
the risk of COVID19. Indeed, ""being in close contact with COVID19 people""
reduces the risk of COVID19. To avoid such potentially erroneous conclusions,
any analysis of observational data must take account of the underlying causal
structure including colliders and confounders. If analysts fail to do this
explicitly then any conclusions they make about the effect of specific risk
factors on COVID19 are likely to be flawed.

protection is mainly due to imperfect fitting of the masks, so that airflow,
which contains virus-transporting droplets, can leak through gaps into or out
of the mask. The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical
and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be
satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient
2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that
already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling
FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and
droplets may pass through the gap. The implications of these findings are
discussed and improvements to existing mask designs are suggested.

for predicting the Covid 19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced
countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this
approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting
preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are
somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial
clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the
pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered
features representing a country response to the early spread of the pandemic. A
Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to
predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to
estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve
fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution
that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks
of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil,
with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the
19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected
Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with S\~ao Paulo leading
with almost 65 thousands estimated, confirmed cases. The estimated end of the
pandemics (with 97 percent of cases reaching an outcome) starts as of May 28th
for some states and rests through August 14th, 2020.

  transmissibility and social distancing measures","A number of models in mathematical epidemiology have been developed to
account for control measures such as vaccination or quarantine. However,
COVID-19 has brought unprecedented social distancing measures, with a challenge
on how to include these in a manner that can explain the data, but avoid
overfitting in parameter inference. We here develop a simple non-homologous
model, where social distancing effects are introduced analogous to course
grained models of gene expression control in systems biology. We apply our
approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection and fatality
counts (observed between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland China provinces),
which we explain through interplay of transmissibility and effective protection
differences. That is, we obtain a negative feedback (also commonly encountered
in systems biology) between transmissibility and effects of social distancing,
with Hubei being an outlier with both large transmissibility and lower social
distancing effects. While Case Fatality Rate is significantly larger for Hubei,
we find that Infection Fatality Rates (IFRs) are much more uniform/consistent
across all the provinces. Even for Wuhan, our inferred Infection Attack Rate is
much below the herd immunity threshold, raising a major reemission risk. The
obtained results demonstrate applicability of our developed method to extract
key infection parameters directly from the data (publicly available for a
number of countries), so that it can be applied globally to potential future
outbreaks of COVID-19, or other infectious diseases.

hundred thousand deaths by April 20201. Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA)
is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the

different regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA
and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling
out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control
policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the
limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by
18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and
wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a
non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed
countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather
effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors
most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced
reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to
restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe
respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China,
Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due

response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to
reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of
schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social
distancing, including local and national lockdowns. We use a Monte-Carlo (MC)
based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population
densities using the most recent epidemic data in our work. We test the spread
of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various
combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each
model and constraint. In this paper, we have tested three different time-cyclic
patterns of no-restrictions/lockdown patterns. This model's main prediction is
that a cyclic schedule of no-restrictions/lockdown that contains at least ten
days of lockdown for each time cycle can help control the virus infection. In
particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social
distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.

  economy?","We analyse the economics and epidemiology of different scenarios for a phased
restart of the UK economy. Our economic model is designed to address the unique
features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both
supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting
economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to
model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts
conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry
are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also
includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption.
We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of
production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects,
and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few
industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and
contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the
transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening
scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the
increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that
yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in
economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer
facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare,
and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.

of our century. Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight
it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social
distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this
context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine
the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in
the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number
of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the
absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic
individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an
uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and
inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model
an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to
the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the
speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical
formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or
the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to
avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation
results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These
results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August
2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the
beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days.
This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of
infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced if
the periods of no-isolation days are shortened.

  chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks","Under the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest
X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,

debate around contact tracing apps -- the tech-enabled response to the
pandemic. As corporations, academics, governments, and civil society discuss
the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit
assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet
access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to
install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential
exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this
work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough
smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight
a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the
elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially
distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest
risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are
already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn
about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and
corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios
where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy. In
this work we call for a comprehensive and equitable policy response that
prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, protects human rights, and
considers long term impact instead of focusing on technology-first fixes.

but we lack empirical evidence on the nature and magnitude of these
disruptions. Here we report the results of a survey of approximately 4,500
Principal Investigators (PIs) at U.S.- and Europe-based research institutions.
Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how
scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research
output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals'
characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on
average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share
reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to
field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most
negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists
reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics
examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved
dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines
similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can
account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce
evidence about the role of parenting in scientists' work, these results
highlight the fundamental and heterogeneous ways this pandemic is affecting the
scientific workforce, and may have broad relevance for shaping responses to the
pandemic's effect on science and beyond.

  different intervention strategies","The Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model is
one of the standard models of disease spreading. Here we analyse an extended
SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an
important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of
analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of
infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected
population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions
for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time
exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the
linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention
strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The
two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive
number, $R_0$, to a target value $R^{\rm target}_0 < 1$, but in distinct ways,
which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same $R^{\rm
target}_0 < 1$, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD.
However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our
study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new
cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised
dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre-
and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. We apply
our results to the COVID data for India to obtain heuristic projections for the
course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend on the
assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.

  privacy-utility trade-offs in COVID-19 contact-tracing apps","Contact-tracing apps have potential benefits in helping health authorities to
act swiftly to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, their effectiveness is
heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by
people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy
risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user
identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined
people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after
informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a
U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs
covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic
contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our
analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals.
  Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of
people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server
for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority
to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to
infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our
sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations
in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps
using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic
contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as
hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the
U.S.

is the key protection factor against COVID-19. Social distancing alone should
have been enough to protect again the virus, yet things have gone very
differently, with a big mismatch between theory and practice. What are the
reasons? A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and
the corresponding people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the
world-first dataset on social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to
see for the first time how people really implement social distancing, identify
dangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future
pandemics.
  Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social
distance data from people in Italy for over two months during the most critical
COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated if and how wearing various
Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.
  Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous
strategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of
social distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the
paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior. In
shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without
filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should
be recommended for general use, as they give an extra powerful safety boost.
Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work well on social
distancing: explicit focus on the behavioral problems of necessary mobility are
needed.

  World","While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life
in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much
public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus
pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among
solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or
slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social
distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of
social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing
down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be
minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every
individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can
minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be
found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large
class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social
sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes
many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and
can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or
allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible
distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and
analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different
contact values are assigned to different network sites.

  scoring of chest X-rays for SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity","Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the assessment
of the severity of disease progression. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to
assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two important assessment metrics being extent
of lung involvement and degree of opacity. In this proof-of-concept study, we
assess the feasibility of computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung
disease severity using a deep learning system.
  Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 396 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2 positive
patient cases. Geographic extent and opacity extent were scored by two
board-certified expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of experience) and a
2nd-year radiology resident. The deep neural networks used in this study, which
we name COVIDNet-S, are based on a COVID-Net network architecture. 100 versions
of the network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic extent
scoring and 50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets of CXRs
from the study, and evaluated the networks using stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments.
  Findings: The COVIDNet-S deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.664 $\pm$
0.001 and 0.635 $\pm$ 0.002 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for
geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively, in stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved R$^2$ of
0.739 and 0.741 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic
extent and opacity extent, respectively.
  Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that the use of deep
neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are
needed before adoption for routine clinical use.

essential tool for managing the epidemic. App-based solutions have emerged for
Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced
by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two
well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked
as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked
over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app
requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no
cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan
Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel
""cross hashing"" approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure
durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected
individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been
exposed using $k$-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection. We
empirically demonstrate that this modified protocol can offer like-for-like
efficacy to the existing protocol.

different impacts on projects with different characteristics including
programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has
a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally,

findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some

informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the
fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a
groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial
sectors, and medical imaging.
  The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying
disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to
common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases,
and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the
healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data
related for the reasons stated above.
  Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to
be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly
reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the
properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms
(unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly
transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.
  We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in
2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and
we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data
modelling, and reproducibility.

  from 92 crystal structures","Currently, there is no effective antiviral drugs nor vaccine for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human
genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable
drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity
ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor
complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to
provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in
M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed
by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding
inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL
has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$)
being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated
SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which
endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present
binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition
offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts.

  Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Several models have been developed to predict how the COVID-19 pandemic
spreads, and how it could be contained with non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) such as social distancing restrictions and school and business closures.
This paper demonstrates how evolutionary AI could be used to facilitate the
next step, i.e. determining most effective intervention strategies
automatically. Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription (ESP), it
is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate
them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for
different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic
and the need to minimize their economic impact. While still limited by
available data, early experiments suggest that workplace and school
restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. It also
demonstrates that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and
suggests creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g. by
alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be
increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future
pandemics.

simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we
call {best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine is the
best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we
show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very
effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the
likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long quarantines of relatively low
intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce its size
considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than
complete lockdown for short periods.

into consideration people's voluntarily behavioral response to new information
of transmission risks. Our analysis finds that both policies and information on
transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and
shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes
in social distancing behavior. Our counterfactual experiments suggest that
nationally mandating face masks for employees on April 1st could have reduced
the growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late
April, and could have led to as much as 17 to 55 percent less deaths nationally

Our estimates imply that removing non-essential business closures (while
maintaining school closures, restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants)

also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 25

been infected if stay-at-home orders had not been implemented. Finally, not

  COVID-19 in NYC","The ""New York State on Pause"" executive order came into effect on March 22
with the goal of ensuring adequate social distancing to alleviate the spread of
COVID-19. Pause will remain effective in New York City in some form until early
June. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity
and social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the
""post-Pause"" period in the City. We find that testing capacity must increase
dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in
social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular,
if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing
measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of
September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to
somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000
tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept
at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly
must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress
excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the ""pre-Pause"" social
distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number
of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be
performing 500,000 tests per day. Our findings have important implications on
the magnitude of the testing capacity the City needs as it relaxes the social
distancing measures to reopen its economy.

  Drugs","As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, researchers are reporting findings of
randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental
drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects
are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may
find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs.
Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that
random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal
treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an
innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect
is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard
care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of
near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of
decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the
empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed
average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and
ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields
treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by
prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.

adults aged 21 to 40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038
days of PA. Four distinct rest activity rhythms (RARs) were identified using
k-means clustering of participants' temporally distributed step counts.
Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of time spent in each of these RAR
revealed 4 groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and
during the lockdown. Substantial but asymmetric delays in bedtime and waketime
resulted in a 24 min increase in weekday sleep duration with no loss in sleep
efficiency. Resting heart rate declined 2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 38%. 4
groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were
better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown.
The least active group comprising 51 percent of the sample, were younger and
predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the
greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend
differences. Among different mobility restrictions, removal of habitual social
cues by lockdown had the largest effect on PA and sleep. Sleep and resting
heart rate unexpectedly improved. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of
responses to lockdown and can identify characteristics of persons at risk of
decline in health and wellbeing.

  Bounds and Limitations","Accurate forecasts for COVID-19 are necessary for better preparedness and
resource management. Specifically, deciding the response over months or several
months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging
as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder
accurate long-term forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases.
While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests
need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of
unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We
show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual
cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our
prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic
cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated
only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct
an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable
bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio
and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to
identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York
City and several US states. Our results demonstrate with high confidence that
the actual number of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times
in Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts and 29 times in New Jersey, than the
reported cases.

prefectures included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases
exceeding ten, the number of daily confirmed cases follow bell-shape or
log-normal distribution in most prefectures. A good correlation was observed
between the spread and decay durations. However, some exceptions were observed
in areas where travelers returned from foreign countries, which were defined as
the origins of infection clusters. Excluding these prefectures, the population
density was shown to be a major factor affecting the spread and decay patterns,
with R2=0.39 (p<0.05) and 0.42 (p<0.05), respectively, approximately
corresponding to social distancing. The maximum absolute humidity was found to
affect the decay duration normalized by the population density (R2>0.36, p
<0.05). Our findings indicate that the estimated pandemic spread duration,
based on the multivariate analysis of maximum absolute humidity, ambient
temperature, and population density (adjusted R2=0.53, p-value<0.05), could
prove useful for intervention planning during potential future pandemics,

to the spread of a disease during an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 epidemic of

world conditions and limits to the availability of diagnostic tests, which
necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough

accurate conclusions. In this manuscript, we provide a stochastic model of
sampling for assessing confidence in disease metrics such as trend detection,
peak detection, and disease spread estimation. Our model simulates testing for
a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo
sampling to assess metric confidence. This model can provide realistic
simulated data which can be used in the design and calibration of data analysis

in the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day,
and an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$
unbiased samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to
assess more advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy

  Generation","Beyond the common difficulties faced in the natural image captioning, medical
report generation specifically requires the model to describe a medical image
with a fine-grained and semantic-coherence paragraph that should satisfy both
medical commonsense and logic. Previous works generally extract the global
image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to
referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the
regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area
of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be
considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are
many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal
regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely
to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To
address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge
Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists' working patterns. In more detail,
ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic
information to guide medical knowledge transfer and learning. The core
structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language
decoder, inspired by advanced Generative Pre-Training (GPT). Experiments on the
CX-CHR dataset and our COVID-19 CT Report dataset demonstrate that our proposed
ASGK is able to generate a robust and accurate report, and moreover outperforms

results confirm that SARS and MERS research 2008-2017 experienced anomalously
high increases in Mendeley readers in April-May 2020. Nevertheless, studies
learning COVID-19 lessons from SARS and MERS or using them as a benchmark for
COVID-19 have generated much more academic interest than primary studies of
SARS or MERS. Thus, research that interprets prior relevant research for new

  evaluating COVID-19 patients by combining bidimensional empirical mode
  decomposition and CLAHE","COVID-19 is a new pulmonary disease which is driving stress to the hospitals
due to the large number of cases worldwide. Imaging of lungs can play a key
role in monitoring of the healthy status. Non-contrast chest computed
tomography (CT) has been used for this purpose, mainly in China, with a
significant success. However, this approach cannot be used massively mainly for
both high risk and cost and in some countries also because this tool is not
extensively available. Alternatively, chest X-ray, although less sensitive than
CT-scan, can provide important information about the evolution of pulmonary
involvement during the disease, this aspect is very important to verify the
response of a patient to treatments. Here, we show how to improve the
sensitivity of chest X-ray via a nonlinear post processing tool, named PACE,
combining properly fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition
and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The results show
an enhancement of the image contrast as confirmed by three widely used metrics:
(i) contrast improvement index, (ii) entropy, and (iii) measure of enhancement.
This improvement gives rise to a detectability of more lung lesions as
identified by two radiologists, which evaluate the images separately, and
confirmed by CT-scans. Based on our findings this method is proved as a
flexible and effective way for medical image enhancement and can be used as a
post-processing step for medical image understanding and analysis.

  Chest X-rays","In this work we design an end-to-end deep learning architecture for
predicting, on Chest X-rays images (CXR), a multi-regional score conveying the
degree of lung compromise in COVID-19 patients. Such semi-quantitative scoring
system, namely \texttt{Brixia~score}, is applied in serial monitoring of such
patients, showing significant prognostic value, in one of the hospitals that
experienced one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a
challenging visual task, we adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy
structured to handle different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment, and
score estimation) trained with a ""from part to whole"" procedure involving
different datasets. In particular, we exploit a clinical dataset of almost
5,000 CXR annotated images collected in the same hospital. Our BS-Net
demonstrates self-attentive behavior and a high degree of accuracy in all
processing stages. Through inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard
comparison, we show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in
rating accuracy and consistency, thus supporting the possibility of using this
tool in contexts of computer-assisted monitoring. Highly resolved (super-pixel
level) explainability maps are also generated, with an original technique, to
visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We
also consider other scores proposed in literature and provide a comparison with
a recently proposed non-specific approach. We eventually test the performance
robustness of our model on a variegated public COVID-19 dataset, for which we
also provide \texttt{Brixia~score} annotations, observing good direct
generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that highlight the portability of
BS-Net in other clinical settings. The CXR dataset along with the source code
and the trained model are publicly released for research purposes.

could be adverse consequences when misinformation is not quashed promptly.
However, the usual supervised approach to debunking via misinformation

scientific and news sources according to sentence similarity to the claims.
Second, we prime a language model with the extracted evidence and finally
evaluate the correctness of given claims based on the perplexity scores at
debunking time. We construct two new COVID-19-related test sets, one is
scientific, and another is political in content, and empirically verify that
our system performs favorably compared to existing systems. We are releasing

study the SARS-Cov-II (Covid-19) epidemiological associated curves and its
propagation. The Moyal parameters give all the information to describe the form

its global impact. We checked that the Moyal distribution can accurately fit

country, in that places where the contagion is reaching their final phase,
describing the beginning, the most intense phase and the descend of the

  Large Multicenter Cohort","Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable
models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other
pneumonias, ILD and normal CTs.
  Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs
from 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing
cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and
559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification
of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and
random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D
features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of
airspace opacities.
  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace
opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the
typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and
control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83,
sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and
0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19
pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild
COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for
other pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness
of our method against different compositions of control groups.
  Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other
types of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging
features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and
classification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis
of COVID-19.

  from a natural experiment in Sweden","The Bacille Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity
benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized
that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found
that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhood
vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,
this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took
place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led
to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us
to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with
cross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were
recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change,
representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used
regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19
related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high
precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled
trial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations
were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]),
respectively. We can thus reject with 95\% confidence that universal BCG
vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of
hospitalizations by more than 24%. While the effect of a recent vaccination
must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at
birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.

more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of
the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out
rates after COVID-19, and this effect was more salient among Democratic than
Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those
who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic)
were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who
practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among
Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males,

difficulty is due to ignoring or overestimating time delay between reporting

dependence of the CFR. We find that for each country, there is a unique value
of the time lag between reported cases and deaths versus time, that yields the
optimal correlation between them is a specific sense. We find that the
resulting corrected CFR (deaths shifted back by this time lag, divided by
cases) is actually constant over many months, for many countries, but also for
the entire world. This optimal time lag and constant CFR for each country can
be found through a simple data driven algorithm. The traditional CFR (ignoring
time lag) is spuriously time-dependent and its evolution is hard to quantify.
Our corrected CFR is constant over time, therefore an important index of the
pandemic in each country, and can be inferred from data earlier on,
facilitating improved early estimates of COVID-19 mortality.

  of COVID-19 in India","In this paper we propose an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19.
The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in
a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not
infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of
dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level.
The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include
testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide
lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the
context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration
or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the
metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on
this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with
COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states,
prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters
are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while
training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the
present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of
testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be
contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by
certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also
necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid
of the second wave of pandemic.

demonstrate the responsibility of national authorities in designing these games

was able to continue when the COVID-19 crisis necessitated the abrupt
suspension of on-campus education. The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students
conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers,
required students to follow the entire arc of an empirical research cycle
twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was
based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of
experimental research and methods of scientific research. The flipped classroom
approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the
students' actual experiments were carried out independently at home or
elsewhere without the in-person supervision of an instructor. Despite the
COVID-19 measures, all students were able to produce interesting and successful
research projects. While there were of course difficulties encountered due to
the abrupt transition to online teaching, we found several counterbalancing
advantages that bear consideration for inclusion even when all teaching
activities can return to campus. We believe that three components in the design
of the course were vital to the resilience of the course: the choice for fully
open-inquiry projects, the decision to use Arduinos as measurement tools, and
the flipped aspect of the instruction methods. We also include considerations
for adapting these pandemic-resilient methods in other courses and programs.

almost all governments worldwide to take drastic measures to respond to the
tragedy. Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries
and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep
social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted
mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful,
policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the
mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to
recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit
strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health
interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key
parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb.In this paper, we
propose to augment epidemiological forecasting with actual data-driven models
that will learn to fine-tune predictions for different contexts (e.g., per
country). We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit
that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of
the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm
component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and
objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various
countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with
much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and
achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen
countries. When used for forecasting, this approach provides actionable
insights into the impact of individual measures and strategies.

Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who
engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour)
reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no
difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to
share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic
purposes might help to make people feel calmer.

  nonpharmaceutical interventions in Germany","Aims: Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of
schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown""
(from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these
interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time.
Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by
incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay.
Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were
estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series.
Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as
reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and
March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are
found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at
April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From
March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below
one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be
attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes.
Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly.
Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus,
the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover,
assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates
and the influence of test volume.

  For Proximity Detection in a Commuter Bus","We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus
in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API.
This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps.
Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of handset locations and are
publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API
need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a
complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment.
Changing the people holding a pair of handsets, with the location of the
handsets otherwise remaining unchanged, can cause variations of +/-10dB in the
attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss
Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus
measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered
despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for
at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification
rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an
exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the
exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by
distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak
dependence of detection rate on distance.

  Pandemic","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges
for the utilities and grid operators around the world. In this work, we focus
on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions,
power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and
daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in
short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing
information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot
capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic.
In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to
complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data
acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the
implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major
challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are
associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we
design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between
several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the
diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the
algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations
for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform
conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds. In addition, we
demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to project how electricity
consumption would recover based on different mobility scenarios.

  neural networks","On 19th March, the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Through
this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed
cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures.
However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this
exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt
to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to
quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a
neural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative
infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government
restriction time series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions.
Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model
government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social
distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government
actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter
entry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less
confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but
milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting
Taiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely
data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical
epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that
the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.

several areas. The Poisson process is the most common process used for this
purpose, in particular, its generalization that considers the intensity
function to be stochastic. This is called a Cox process and different choices
to model the dynamics of the intensity gives raise to a wide range of models.
We present a new class of unidimensional Cox process models in which the
intensity function assumes parametric functional forms that switch among them
according to a continuous-time Markov chain. A novel methodology is proposed to
perform exact Bayesian inference based on MCMC algorithms. The term exact
refers to the fact that no discrete time approximation is used and Monte Carlo
error is the only source of inaccuracy. The reliability of the algorithms
depends on a variety of specifications which are carefully addressed, resulting
in a computationally efficient (in terms of computing time) algorithm and
enabling its use with large datasets. Simulated and real examples are presented
to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology. A
specific model to fit epidemic curves is proposed and used to analyze data from
Dengue Fever in Brazil and COVID-19 in some countries.

the population can, at any given time, be a hidden source of transmissions. In
response, many governments have shown great interest in smartphone contact

the public health and economy worldwide. To overcome this problem, countries
have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for
controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new
SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to
simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people,
business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing
interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects:
(1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation,
(5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks
together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of
implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths
and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks
and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of
social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming
language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended
to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the
creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to
assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the

management of their own safety during an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19
by enabling them to view, in advance, the risks they would take if they visit
some given venue (a cafe, the gym, the workplace, the park,...) and,
furthermore, track the accumulation of such risks during the course of any
given day or week. This idea can be presented to users of the app as counting
points. One point represents some constant probability, $p_\text{point}$, of
infection. Then the app would work in a similar way to a calorie counting app
(instead of counting calories we count probability increments of being
infected). Government could set a maximum recommended number of daily (or
weekly) points available to each user in accord with its objectives (bringing
the disease under control, allowing essential workers to work, protecting
vulnerable individuals, ...). It is posited that this, along with other
proposed ""levers"" would allow government to manage a gradual transition to
normalcy. I discuss a circuit framework with wires running between boxes. In
this framework the wires represent possible sources of infection, namely
individuals and the venues themselves (through deposits of pathogens left at
the venue). The boxes represent interactions of these sources (when individuals
visit a venue). This circuit framework allows (i) calculation of points cost
for visiting venues and (ii) probabilistic contact tracing. The points systems
proposed here could complement existing contact tracing apps by adding
functionality to permit users to participate in decision making up front.

  spread","Recent analysis of COVID-19 data from China showed that the number of
confirmed cases followed a subexponential power-law increase, with a growth
exponent of around 2.2. The power-law behavior was attributed to a combination
of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as well as behavioral
changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo
simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Social distancing is
incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each
step in the random walk process. The step size $l$ is taken to be a multiple of
$\langle r \rangle$, which is the average separation between individuals. Three
temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are
shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For $l = \langle r \rangle$, we
get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with
available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for
smaller step sizes $l \lesssim \langle r \rangle/2 $, while for large $l$ the
growth is found to be exponential. Together with available data, these results
suggest that the early containment of the disease within China was close to
optimal. We further performed a comparative case study of data from three other
countries, India, Brazil and South Africa. We show that reasonable agreement
with these data can be obtained by incorporating small-world-like connections

with time delay, and constant parameters throughout the outbreak, including the
contagion rate. The contention measures are reflected on an effective reduced

time-dependent contagion rate that reflects the contention measures either
through a step by step fitting process or by following an exponential decay. In
this last model the population is considered the one of the country $N$. In the
linear region of the differential equations, when the total population $N$ is
large the predictions are independent of $N$. We apply these methodologies to
study the spread of the pandemic in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and
South Africa for which the infection peaks are yet to be reached. In all of
these cases we provide estimates for the reproduction and recovery rates. The
scenario for a time varying contagion rate is optimistic, considering that
reasonable measures are taken such that the reproduction factor $R_0$ decreases
exponentially. The measured values for the recovery rate $\gamma$ are reported
finding a universality of this parameter over various countries. We discuss the

optimizing medical resources. Forecasting emerging outbreaks pose a particular
challenge because many existing forecasting techniques learn from historical
seasons trends. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM-based cells are a
logical choice of model due to their ability to learn temporal dynamics. In
this paper, we adapt the state and county level influenza model, TDEFSI-LONLY,
proposed in Wang et a. [l2020] to national and county level COVID-19 data. We
show that this model poorly forecasts the current pandemic. We analyze the two
week ahead forecasting capabilities of the TDEFSI-LONLY model with combinations
of regularization techniques. Effective training of the TDEFSI-LONLY model
requires data augmentation, to overcome this challenge we utilize an SEIR model

sufficient training data. Further, we propose an alternate forecast model, {\it
County Level Epidemiological Inference Recurrent Network} (\alg{}) that trains
an LSTM backbone on national confirmed cases to learn a low dimensional time
pattern and utilizes a time distributed dense layer to learn individual county
confirmed case changes each day for a two weeks forecast. We show that the

understand how quickly the epidemic was spreading. When an increase/decrease

generalizability. Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the
efficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19
diagnosis. We provide results from two popular models - COVID-Net and CoroNet
evaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional
dataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing
patients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large
false positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR
(23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54

significantly lower across all the datasets as compared to COVID-Net -
EMORY(9.1%), ChexPert (1.3%), ChestX-ray14 (0.02%), MIMIC-CXR (0.06%).
Conclusion: The models reported good to excellent performance on their internal
datasets, however we observed from our testing that their performance
dramatically worsened on external data. This is likely from several causes
including overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and
ground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR,
which could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa.
Therefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have

  Prevent COVID-19 Community Transmission","To slow down the spread of COVID-19, governments around the world are trying
to identify infected people and to contain the virus by enforcing isolation and
quarantine. However, it is difficult to trace people who came into contact with
an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission and mass
infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government Privacy
Preserving Mobile and Fog computing framework entitled PPMF that can trace
infected and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with
contact tracing app and two types of stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk
Checkers (ARC) and Suspected User Data Uploader Node (SUDUN), to trace
community transmission alongside maintaining user data privacy. Each user's
mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when
registering on the central application. The mobile device and the central
application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC),
which broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The ARCs are
placed at the entry points of buildings, which can immediately detect if there
are positive or suspected cases nearby. If any confirmed case is found, the
ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the
identity of the infected person. The SUDUNs are placed at the health centers
that report test results to the central cloud application. The reported data is
later used to map between infected and suspected cases. Therefore, using our
proposed PPMF framework, governments can let organizations continue their
economic activities without complete lockdown.

uses recursive multinomial approximations to integrate over unobserved
variables and thus circumvent likelihood intractability. The method is
applicable to a class of discrete-time, finite-population compartmental models
with partial, randomly under-reported or missing count observations. In
contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives such as Approximate Bayesian
Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the model is required and
there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate marginal likelihood
of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple filtering
recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis
of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. We show how the method can be embedded within a

k-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and
k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the

Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as

slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the
forecasts. The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting
COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform
reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a
large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period

as a response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and has resorted to a
process of 'unlocking' the lockdown over the past couple of months. This work
attempts to examine the effect of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its
resulting disease, the COVID-19, on the foreign exchange rates and stock market
performances of India using secondary data over a span of 112 days spanning
between March 11 and June 30, 2020. The study explores whether the causal
relationships and directions among the growth rate of confirmed cases
(GROWTHC), exchange rate (GEX) and SENSEX value (GSENSEX) are remaining the
same across different pre and post-lockdown phases, attempting to capture any
potential changes over time via the vector autoregressive (VAR) models. A
positive correlation is found between the growth rate of confirmed cases and
the growth rate of exchange rate, and a negative correlation between the growth
rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of SENSEX value. However, on
applying a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, it is observed that an increase
in the confirmed COVID-19 cases causes no significant change in the values of
the exchange rate and SENSEX index. The result varies if the analysis is split
across different time periods - before lockdown, the four phases of lockdown,
and the first phase of unlock. Nuanced and sensible interpretations of the
numeric results indicate significant variability across time in terms of the
relation between the variables of interest. The detailed knowledge about the

constrained Gaussian graphical models. This problem can be formulated as a
penalized maximum likelihood estimation of the precision matrix under Laplacian
structural constraints. Like in the classical graphical lasso problem, recent
works made use of the $\ell_1$-norm regularization with the goal of promoting
sparsity in Laplacian structural precision matrix estimation. However, we find
that the widely used $\ell_1$-norm is not effective in imposing a sparse
solution in this problem. Through empirical evidence, we observe that the
number of nonzero graph weights grows with the increase of the regularization
parameter. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a large regularization
parameter will surprisingly lead to a fully connected graph. To address this
issue, we propose a nonconvex estimation method by solving a sequence of
weighted $\ell_1$-norm penalized sub-problems and prove that the statistical
error of the proposed estimator matches the minimax lower bound. To solve each
sub-problem, we develop a projected gradient descent algorithm that enjoys a
linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments involving synthetic and

expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where
all individuals are susceptible, effective reproduction number is the number of
cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper, we exploit
the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them
through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the
pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease

spreading. Second, if the network changes the structure on the way of infection
spreading or after its suppression, the peak of the second wave can be larger
than the first. Third, the peak height in the time series depends on the
difference between the upper bound of the number of people each member accepts
to meet and the number of people one chooses to meet. This tendency is observed
for two kinds of artificial networks and implies the impact of the bridges
between communities on the virus spreading. Fourth, the release of once given
constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the time series
without introducing any constraint from the beginning, if the release is
introduced at a time close to the peak. Thus, both governments and individuals
should be careful in returning to human society with inter-community contacts.

  Epidemic by Vehicle Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery","Wuhan, the biggest city in China's central region with a population of more
than 11 million, was shut down to control the COVID-19 epidemic on 23 January,
2020. Even though many researches have studied the travel restriction between
cities and provinces, few studies focus on the transportation control inside
the city, which may be due to the lack of the measurement of the transportation
ban. Therefore, we evaluate the implementation of transportation ban policy
inside the city by extracting motor vehicles on the road from two
high-resolution remote sensing image sets before and after Wuhan lockdown. In
order to detect vehicles from the remote sensing image datasets with the
resolution of 0.8m accurately, we proposed a novel method combining anomaly
detection, region grow and deep learning. The vehicle numbers in Wuhan dropped
with a percentage of at least 63.31% caused by COVID-19. Considering fewer
interferences, the dropping percentages of ring road and high-level road should
be more representative with the value of 84.81% and 80.22%. The districts
located in city center were more intensively affected by the transportation
ban. Since the public transportations have been shut down, the significant
reduction of motor vehicles indicates that the lockdown policy in Wuhan show
effectiveness in controlling human transmission inside the city.

on possible changes in electricity consumption trends. The overall theme of
these reports was that ``electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but
the power grid is still reliable''---mostly due to reduced economic activity.
In this paper we analyze electricity data upto end of May 2020, examining both
electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid,
such as peak demand and demand ramp-rate. We limit this study to three states
in the USA: New York, California, and Florida. The results indicate that the
effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction from
comparable time frames, and there are noticeable differences among regions. The
variables that can indicate stress on the grid also conveyed mixed messages:
some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not
indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes
that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to
revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to
the pandemic is correcting for weather. We provide a weather-correction method,
apply it to a small city-wide area, and discuss the implications of the
estimated changes in demand. The weather correction exercise underscored that
weather-correction is as challenging as it is important.

they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such
sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive
and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the
United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into
consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel
pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and
emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people
about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51
states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic
characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of
COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to
perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors
that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from
the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education
levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher
house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast,
households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to
reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments.

efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated
information at the global, country, and the U.S. state scale. Considering the
multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the
single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness
in certain geographical regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive
index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time
window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data
are amendable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the
proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March
11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less
periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have
obviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons
reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting
mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of
mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation

arises. The Optimal Steps Model (OSM) is a pedestrian locomotion model that
operationalizes an individual's need for personal space. We present new
parameter values for personal space in the Optimal Steps Model to simulate
social distancing in the pedestrian dynamics simulator Vadere. Our approach is
pragmatic. We consider two use cases: in the first we demand that a set social
distance must never be violated. In the second the social distance must be kept
only on average. For each use case we conduct simulation studies in a typical
bottleneck scenario and measure contact times, that is, violations of the
social distance rule. We derive rules of thumb for suitable parameter choices
in dependency of the desired social distance. We test the rules of thumb for
the social distances 1.5m and 2.0m and observe that the new parameter values
indeed lead to the desired social distancing. Thus, the rules of thumb will
quickly enable Vadere users to conduct their own studies without understanding
the intricacies of the OSM implementation and without extensive parameter
adjustment.

non-violent mortality of Peru, controlling for the effect of quarantine.
Methods: Analysis of longitudinal data from the departments of Peru using
official public information from the National Death Information System and the
Ministry of Health of Peru. The analysis is performed between January 1, 2018
and June 23, 2020 (100 days of quarantine). The daily death rate per million
inhabitants has been used. The days in which the departments were quarantined
with a limit number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 were used to estimate the
quarantine impact. Three limits were established for cases: less than 1, 10 and
100 cases. Result: In Peru, the daily death rate per million inhabitants
decreased by -1.89 (95% CI: -2.70; -1.07) on quarantine days and without
COVID-19 cases. When comparing this result with the total number of non-violent
deaths, the excess deaths during the first 100 days of quarantine is 36,230.
This estimate is 1.12 times the estimate with data from 2019 and 4.2 times the
deaths officers by COVID-19. Conclusion: Quarantine reduced nonviolent deaths;
however, they are overshadowed by the increase as a direct or indirect cause of
the pandemic. Therefore, the difference between the number of current deaths
and that of past years underestimates the real excess of deaths.

This is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce

including US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with
the US having the worst performance. Furthermore, Iran and South Korea are
likely to experience the second wave of the pandemic. A real-time exercise show
that the proposed structure delivers timely and precise information on the
current stance of the pandemic ahead of the competitors that use rolling
window. This, in turn, transforms into accurate short-term predictions of the
active cases. We further modify the model to allow for unreported cases.
Results suggest that the effects of the presence of these cases on the

  Retrieval Systems for COVID-19 Literature","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a tremendous need for access to the
latest scientific information, primarily through the use of text mining and
search tools. This has led to both corpora for biomedical articles related to
COVID-19 (such as the CORD-19 corpus (Wang et al., 2020)) as well as search
engines to query such data. While most research in search engines is performed
in the academic field of information retrieval (IR), most academic search
engines$\unicode{x2013}$though rigorously evaluated$\unicode{x2013}$are
sparsely utilized, while major commercial web search engines (e.g., Google,

commercial search engines deployed for the pandemic will gain much higher
traction than those produced in academic labs, and thus leads to questions
about the empirical performance of these search tools. This paper seeks to
empirically evaluate two such commercial search engines for COVID-19, produced
by Google and Amazon, in comparison to the more academic prototypes evaluated
in the context of the TREC-COVID track (Roberts et al., 2020). We performed
several steps to reduce bias in the available manual judgments in order to
ensure a fair comparison of the two systems with those submitted to TREC-COVID.

major challenge for privacy systems around the globe. The disease's size and
magnitude is not uncommon but it appears to be at the point of hysteria
surrounding it. Consequently, in a very short time, extreme measures for
dealing with the situation appear to have become the norm. Any such actions
affect the privacy of individuals in particular. For some cases, there is
intensive monitoring of the whole population while the medical data of those
diagnosed with the virus is commonly circulated through institutions and
nations. This may well be in the interest of saving the world from a deadly
disease, but is it really appropriate and right? Although creative solutions
have been implemented in many countries to address the issue, proponents of
privacy are concerned that technologies will eventually erode privacy, while
regulators and privacy supporters are worried about what kind of impact this
could bring. While that tension has always been present, privacy has been
thrown into sharp relief by the sheer urgency of containing an exponentially
spreading virus. The essence of this dilemma indicates that establishing the
right equilibrium will be the best solution. The jurisprudence concerning cases
regarding the willingness of public officials to interfere with the
constitutional right to privacy in the interests of national security or public

  with dynamic segregation","Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding
of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from
Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap.
Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost
uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of
education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to
cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people
from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service
jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but
the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this
sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the
extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to
other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census
and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic
segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with
the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The
results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they
live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.

epidemics has been perceived and used as a central element in understanding,
predicting, and governing the pandemic event. However, soon it became clear
that long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover, it
is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the
evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a
consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth
understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation
strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed
to describe the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
instantaneous reproductive ratio. We then introduce and use entropy-based
metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal evolution of
a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of
the outbreak is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process
for a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical
interpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for
calibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the
system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and
transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property
of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we
apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model. Applying the model to the
Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19
data-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of
entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the

imposed and lifted at an early stage of an epidemic. We show that, in these
models, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert
a significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of
a lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the
end of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date
without the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to
explain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental
models. We qualitatively discuss some important effects of a lockdown, which go
beyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease
an epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and
the limitations of currently available data, we conclude that simple
epidemiological models cannot be used to reliably quantify the impact of the
Indian lockdown on fatalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 is essential in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 and for
efficient implementation of control and containment strategies. Magnetic
immunoassay is a novel and emerging topic representing the frontiers of current
biosensing and magnetics areas. The past decade has seen rapid growth in
applying magnetic tools for biological and biomedical applications. Recent
advances in magnetic materials and nanotechnologies have transformed current
diagnostic methods to nanoscale and pushed the detection limit to early stage
disease diagnosis. Herein, this review covers the literatures of magnetic
immunoassay platforms for virus and pathogen detections, before COVID-19. We
reviewed the popular magnetic immunoassay platforms including magnetoresistance
(MR) sensors, magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). Magnetic Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic kits are also reviewed
aiming at developing plug-and-play diagnostics to manage the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak as well as preventing future epidemics. In addition, other platforms
that use magnetic materials as auxiliary tools for enhanced pathogen and virus
detections are also covered. The goal of this review is to inform the

testing budget is often limited. Here we study how institutions, such as
nursing homes, should utilize a fixed test budget for early detection of an

budget of tests, it is generally better to test smaller subgroups of the
population frequently than to test larger groups but less frequently. The
numerical results are consistent with an analytical expression we derive for
the size of the outbreak at detection in an exponential spread model. Our work
provides a simple guideline for institutions: distribute your total tests over
several batches instead of using them all at once. We expect that in the
appropriate scenarios, this easy-to-implement policy recommendation will lead
to earlier detection and better mitigation of local COVID-19 outbreaks.

infection outbreaks in international populations. One example is mobile phone
applications, which attempt to alert infected individuals and their contacts by
automatically inferring two key components of infection risk: the proximity to
an individual who may be infected, and the duration of proximity. The former
component, proximity, relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal
Strength Indicator(RSSI) as a distance sensor, and this has been shown to be
problematic; not least because of unpredictable variations caused by different
device types, device location on-body, device orientation, the local
environment and the general noise associated with radio frequency propagation.
In this paper, we present an approach that infers posterior probabilities over
distance given sequences of RSSI values. Using a single-dimensional Unscented
Kalman Smoother (UKS) for non-linear state space modelling, we outline several
Gaussian process observation transforms, including: a generative model that
directly captures sources of variation; and a discriminative model that learns
a suitable observation function from training data using both distance and
infection risk as optimisation objective functions. Our results show that good
risk prediction can be achieved in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time on real-world data

challenging to understand, especially as these and other parameters are
conceptually overlapping and sometimes confusingly named. Moreover, the

different mathematical approaches that should be understood and accounted for
when relying on parameter values and reporting them to the public. Here, we
offer several insights regarding the derivation of commonly-reported
epidemiological parameters, and describe how mitigation measures like lockdown
are expected to affect their values. We aim to present these quantitative
relationships in a manner that is accessible to the widest audience possible.

people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to
maintain social distancing of at least 2 m to limit the risk of exposure to the
coronavirus. Experimental data, however, show that infected aerosols and
droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We
propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is
proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our
puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm
air} < 4.0$, where $\rho_P$ and $\rho_{\rm air}$ are the average density of the
puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold
or warmth. We also demonstrate that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended
for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its
coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.

of mankind's modern institutions and or survival of many individuals is at
stake. There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as
SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified;
those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice.
  Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three
svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment
algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment
scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches as much as the other
mutations. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can
bind to U, hence, our scoring. We also validate this hypothesis using a novel,
independent computational experiment. To validate our results, we confirmed the
discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the tested publicly available
genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2
orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also
report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered
orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore,
antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.

coronavirus has rapidly become pandemics, mainly due to its extremely high
human-to-human transmission capability, and a surprisingly high viral charge of
symptom-less people. While the seek of a vaccine is still ongoing, promising
results have been obtained with antiviral compounds. In particular, lactoferrin
is found to have beneficial effects both in preventing and soothing the
infection. Here, we explore the possible molecular mechanisms with which
lactoferrin interferes with SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion, preventing attachment
and/or entry of the virus. To this aim, we search for possible interactions
lactoferrin may have with virus structural proteins and host receptors.
Representing the molecular iso-electron surface of proteins in terms of
2D-Zernike descriptors, we (i) identified putative regions on the lactoferrin
surface able to bind sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane,
sheltering the cell from the virus attachment; (ii) showed that no significant
shape complementarity is present between lactoferrin and the ACE2 receptor,
while (iii) two high complementarity regions are found on the N- and C-terminal
domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, hinting at a possible competition
between lactoferrin and ACE2 for the binding to the spike protein.

  India","COVID-19--a viral infectious disease--has quickly emerged as a global
pandemic infecting millions of people with a significant number of deaths
across the globe. The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the
symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely,
asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no
symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy
individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major
obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious
disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of
COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type
epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix
representing contact structures among different age groups of the population.
Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown
strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the
disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model
is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the

is seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.

  and Tuberculosis Detection Using X-Ray Images in Resource Limited Settings","Clinicians in the frontline need to assess quickly whether a patient with
symptoms indeed has COVID-19 or not. The difficulty of this task is exacerbated
in low resource settings that may not have access to biotechnology tests.
Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low-
and middle-income countries and its common symptoms include fever, cough and
tiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of
COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray
images, a technology available in most hospitals, and their subsequent
classification using machine learning methods that do not require large
computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images
including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,
TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14
individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with
traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50
for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the
best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection
accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the
same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler
three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing
COVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively.
The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to
extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier
with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine. The results suggest the potential
benefits of using our pipeline in the detection of COVID-19, particularly in
resource-limited settings and it can run with limited computational resources.

reported for readers' consideration. However, they made an analysis for the
incidence based on Fisher's hypothesis test for means while they published
detailed time dependent data which were not analyzed, disregarding an important

simple regression analysis.
  We conclude their randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial presents
statistical evidence, at 99% confidence level, that the treatment of Covid-19
patients with hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the appearance of
symptoms if used before or right after exposure to the virus. For 0 to 2 days
after exposure to virus, the estimated relative reduction in symptomatic
outcomes is 72% after 0 days, 48.9% after 1 day and 29.3% after 2 days. For 3
days after exposure, the estimated relative reduction is 15.7% but results are
not statistically conclusive and for 4 or more days after exposure there is no
statistical evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the

  Our results show that the time elapsed between infection and the beginning of
treatment is crucial for the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment to

types (e.g., infective stage, clinical state, risk factor class). We show that

since infection, 1. The age distribution $n(t, a)$ of the population at time
$t$ can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial
differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. 2.
The frequency of type $i$ at time $t$ is simply obtained by integrating the
probability $p(a, i)$ of being in state $i$ at age a against the age
distribution $n(t, a)$. The advantage of this approach is three-fold. First,
regardless of the number of types, macroscopic observables (e.g., incidence or
prevalence of each type) only rely on a one-dimensional PDE ""decorated"" with
types. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the
McKendrick-von Foerster PDE with Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the
epidemic. We illustrate this technique using a French data from the COVID-19
epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard
compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models
can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet
equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity
of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a
universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based
epidemic models, here the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting
age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single
individual.

the forecast suggests that the total number of cases and deaths are expected to
increase in the coming weeks. Moreover, the worldwide data-driven analysis

social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population
densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling
for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship
between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social
capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection
rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus
infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.

multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief
utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify a
constraint to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for
each resource. Such constraints often arise from location constraints (e.g.
among all of the volunteer nurses, only those who live nearby can work at
hospital A due to commute constraints. So hospital A can only receive
allocations of volunteers from a subset of the total supply). This can also
model a type of substitute effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A
\emph{or} B, but some other agents specifically want A, and some specifically
want B. We propose a new mechanism called Group Dominant Resource Fairness
which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs.
The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness,
strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first mechanism to achieve all four
properties in our setting. Furthermore, we show numerically that our method
scales better to large problems than alternative approaches. Finally, although
motivated by the problem of medical resource allocation in a pandemic, our
mechanism can be applied more broadly to resource allocation under Leontief
utilities with accessibility constraints.

a hazardous event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires the integration of a
multiplicity of scientific disciplines. The dynamics emerging from infodemics
have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. In order to react
appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and
Economics to understand the dynamics emerging from it. In the short run,
dynamics might lead to an adaptation in household spending or to a shift in
buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run, changes in
investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that
the dynamics emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as
information and misinformation accessible for individuals and the formation and
revision of beliefs. (Mis)information accessible to individuals is, amongst
others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized
information, while automated fact-checking algorithms can help reduce the
amount of circulating misinformation. The formation and revision of individual
(and probably false) beliefs and individual fact-checking and interpretation of
information are heavily affected by linguistic patterns inherent to information
during pandemics and infodemics and further factors, such as affect, intuition
and motives. We argue that, in order to get a deep(er) understanding of the

integrate the perspectives of Computer Science and Information Systems,

Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow knowing the number of

integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge

learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three,

states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking learning approach, the
cubist, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian

the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute
percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking ensemble
learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared
models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting,
achieving errors in a range of 0.87% - 3.51%, 1.02% - 5.63%, and 0.95% - 6.90%

  Imposed U-Net","The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major
outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe
impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of mid-July 2020,
more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were
reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the
time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a
segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected
by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to
detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to
form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a
suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of
the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is
used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called ""TV-UNet"".
Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation
dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term
leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net
model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the
predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation
performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great
ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU
rate of over 99\%, and a Dice score of around 86\%.

  Infectious Diseases such as COVID-19","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is unfolding as a major
international crisis whose influence extends to every aspect of our daily
lives. Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus
reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart
the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be
greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers
information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine
whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus
typically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing
individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via
a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing
their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such
strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is
especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days
after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many
COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy
strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare
up in the future.
  In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential
learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to
the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through
various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies
that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on
policy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance
bounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as
well as in the tests themselves.

SARS-CoV2-based ABM framework (CoV-ABM) simulates the spread at any
geographical scale, ranging from a village to a country and considers unique
characteristics of SARS-CoV2 viruses such as its persistence in the
environment. Therefore, unlike other simulators, CoV-ABM computes the density
of active viruses inside each location space to get the virus transmission
probability for each agent. It also uses the local census and health data to
create health and risk factor profiles for each individual. The proposed model
relies on a flexible timestamp scale to optimize the computational speed and
the level of detail. In our framework each agent represents a person
interacting with the surrounding space and other adjacent agents inside the
same space. Moreover, families stochastic daily tasks are formulated to get
tracked by the corresponding family members. The model also formulates the

SARS-CoV diseases, to identify places which have a higher probability to become
infection hubs and to provide a decision-support system to design efficient
interventions in order to fight against pandemics. The framework employs SEIHRD

55-59 and 73-80. Based on our preliminary results, we conclude that the
residues 73-80 appear as the regions that facilitate the critical initial steps

  dispatch","Operating a modern power grid reliably in case of SCADA/EMS failure or amid
difficult times like COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging task for grid
operators. In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation dispatch scheme has been
proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing;
however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for
computing and communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises
server and dispatch communication system, proposes and implements a
cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation continuity
regardless of local infrastructure's availability and accessibility. Through
its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution
has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is
independent and fault-tolerant, providing grid monitoring and control
capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or when
operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the
overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to
the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to ""serverless"", the burden of the server
provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of
using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is
architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service
(FaaS) model. This work also develops a comprehensive cyber security mechanism
to comply with critical infrastructure requirements for the power grid, which
can serve as an exemplary framework for other grid operators to secure their
cloud services.

is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the
individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to
minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the
probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of
the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the
previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10000 individuals show
that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can
reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals
confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an
off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.

  Recession","The COVID-19 recession that started in March 2020 led to an unprecedented
decline in economic activity across the globe. To fight this recession, policy
makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper
asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been
effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure
these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector
autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and
monthly information within an unified framework. Our model combines a set of
macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates and
inflation with high frequency information from financial markets such as stock
prices, interest rate spreads and weekly information on the Feds balance sheet
size. The latter set of high frequency time series is used to dynamically
interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We
use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The
results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock
market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a
depreciation of the US dollar compared to a no-policy benchmark scenario.

  Hospitalization in Patients with Suspected COVID-19","The controversy of computed tomography (CT) use in COVID-19 screening is
associated with ambiguous characteristics of chest CT as a diagnostic test. The
reported values of CT sensitivity and specificity calculated using RT-PCR as a
reference standard vary widely. The objective of this study was to reevaluate
the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT using an alternative approach. This
study included 973 symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged 42 $\pm$ 17 years, 56%
females. We reviewed the disease dynamics between the initial and follow-up CT
studies using a ""CT0-4"" grading system. Sensitivity and specificity were
calculated as conditional probabilities that a patient's condition would
improve or deteriorate relative to the initial CT study results. For the
calculation of negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values, we
estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. We used several ARIMA and EST
models with different parameters to fit the data on total cases of COVID-19
from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, and forecast the incidence. The ""CT0-4""
grading scale demonstrated low sensitivity (28%) but high specificity (95%).
The best statistical model for describing the pandemic in Moscow was ETS with
multiplicative trend, error, and season type. According to our calculations,
with the predicted prevalence of 2.1%, the values of NPV and PPV would be 98%
and 10%, correspondingly. We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values with
the small sample size of the patients with severe symptoms and non-optimal
methodological setup for measuring these specific characteristics. The ""CT0-4""
grading scale was highly specific and predictive for identifying admissions to
hospitals of COVID-19 patients. Despite the ambiguous accuracy, chest CT proved
to be an effective practical tool for patient management during the pandemic,
provided that the necessary infrastructure and human resources are available.

can boost the overall test set performance for lung segmentation, binary lesion
segmentation and multiclass lesion segmentation, resulting in mean Dice scores
of 0.982, 0.724 and 0.469, respectively. The resulting binary lesions were
segmented with a mean absolute volume error of 91.3 ml. In general, the task of
distinguishing different lesion types was more difficult, with a mean absolute
volume difference of 152 ml and mean Dice scores of 0.369 and 0.523 for

binary lesion segmentation with an average volume error that is better than

for a large-scale evaluation for use in clinical practice.

In order to understand that how and during which period of time do the

minimizing a loss function, within the broad framework of partially observed
Markov decision processes. For each state, Covid-19 data for 40 days (starting
from May 1 for two northern states and June 1 for four southern states) are
analyzed to estimate the transition probabilities between compartments and
other parameters associated with the evolution of the epidemic. These
quantities are then used to predict the course of the epidemic in the given

leading to different values of the loss function over the training horizon. The
optimal policy allocation is the one corresponding to the smallest loss. Our
analysis shows that none of the six states need lockdowns over the test period,

responsible mask use and social distancing of course need to be continued. The

  during COVID-19: Transform-and-Divide Evolutionary Optimization","Balancing common disease treatment and epidemic control is a key objective of
medical supplies procurement in hospitals during a pandemic such as COVID-19.
This problem can be formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem for
simultaneously optimizing the effects of common disease treatment and epidemic
control. However, due to the large number of supplies, difficulties in
evaluating the effects, and the strict budget constraint, it is difficult for
existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms to efficiently approximate the
Pareto front of the problem. In this paper, we present an approach that first
transforms the original high-dimensional, constrained multiobjective
optimization problem to a low-dimensional, unconstrained multiobjective
optimization problem, and then evaluates each solution to the transformed
problem by solving a set of simple single-objective optimization subproblems,
such that the problem can be efficiently solved by existing evolutionary
multiobjective algorithms. We applied the transform-and-divide evolutionary
optimization approach to six hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, during the
peak of COVID-19. Results showed that the proposed approach exhibits
significantly better performance than that of directly solving the original
problem. Our study has also shown that transform-and-divide evolutionary
optimization based on problem-specific knowledge can be an efficient solution

contacts by using COVID-19 tracing apps. A reliable classification is crucial
to ensure a high level of protection, and at the same time to prevent many
people from being sent to quarantine by the app. Tracing apps are based on the
capabilities of current smartphones to enable a broadest possible availability.
Existing capabilities of smartphones include the exchange of Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) signals and of audio signals, as well as the use of gyroscopes and
magnetic sensors. The Bluetooth power measurements, which are often used today,
may be complemented by audio ranging and attitude estimation in the future.
Smartphones are worn in different ways, often in pockets and bags, which makes
the propagation of signals and thus the classification rather unpredictable.
Relying on the cooperation of users to wear their phones hanging from their
neck would change the situation considerably. In this case the performance,
achievable with BLE and audio measurements, becomes predictable. Our analysis
identifies parameters that result in accurate warnings, at least within the
scope of validity of the models. A significant reduction of the spreading of
the disease can then be achieved by the apps, without causing many people to
unduly go to quarantine. The present paper is the first of three papers which
analyze the situation in some detail.

The identification of characteristic types of time-dependent variations can
lead to the identification of patterns within sets of time series. This, in
turn, can help discern the future of infectious dynamics in an area and,
through identifying the most likely cluster-wise trajectory by calculating the
cluster barycenter, inform public health decision-making.

denser, and more organized than informed communities, with a possibility of a
high volume of the misinformation being part of disinformation campaigns. Our

particular response function such as linear, quadratic, etc. and need the data
to 'speak for themselves'. GAMs do this via the smoothing functions and take
each predictor variable in the model and separate it into sections delimited by
'knots', and then fit polynomial functions to each section separately, with the
constraint that there are no links at the knots - second derivatives of the
separate functions are equal at the knots.

  Traffic Volume, Air Quality, and the Prevalence of COVID-19 Outcomes in Urban
  Neighborhoods","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented policies
to curb the spread of the novel virus. Little is known about how these policies
impact various groups in society. This paper explores the relationship between
social distancing policies, traffic volumes and air quality and how they impact
various socioeconomic groups. This study aims to understand how disparate
communities respond to Stay-at-Home Orders and other social distancing policies
to understand how human behavior in response to policy may play a part in the
prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases. We collected data on traffic density,
air quality, socio-economic status, and positive cases rates of COVID-19 for
each zip code of Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between February 17 and June 12,
2020. We studied the impact of social distancing policies across three periods
of policy implementation. We found that wealthier and whiter zip codes
experienced a greater reduction in traffic and air pollution during the
Stay-at-Home period. However, air quality did not necessarily follow traffic
volumes in every case due to the complexity of interactions between emissions
and meteorology. We also found a strong relationship between lower
socioeconomic status and positive COVID-19 rates. This study provides initial
evidence for social distancing's effectiveness in limiting the spread of
COVID-19, while providing insight into how socioeconomic status has compounded
vulnerability during this crisis. Behavior restrictions disproportionately
benefit whiter and wealthier communities both through protection from spread of
COVID-19 and reduction in air pollution. Such findings may be further
compounded by the impacts of air pollution, which likely exacerbate COVID-19
transmission and mortality rates. Policy makers need to consider adapting
social distancing policies to maximize equity in health protection.

  classification","Motivation: Recognizing named entities (NER) and their associated attributes
like negation are core tasks in natural language processing. However, manually
labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating
barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly
supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from
low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical
ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining
multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label
noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the
extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using
ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required
for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language
models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly
labeled data.
  Results: We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity
classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly
supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new
baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform
within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with
hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct
for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT
provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of
combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly
building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates
how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using
weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.

time series are used to further analyze the relationships between case
trajectories on a month-by-month basis. Our algorithm shows that 31 states are
experiencing second surges, while 4 of the 10 largest states are still in their
first surge, with case counts that have never decreased. This analysis can aid
in highlighting the most and least successful state responses to COVID-19.

through the study of some cases of interest to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
These include pandemic modeling with mixing between different age groups and
also contact matrices associated with contact between countries. For the final

  Brazil: shifting the high risk from the best to the worst socio-economic
  conditions","Currently, Brazil has one of the fastest increasing COVID-19 epidemics in the
world, that has caused at least 94 thousand confirmed deaths until now. The
city of Sao Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populous in
the country. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is important to
help the urgent need to integrate better actions to face the pandemic. Thus,
this study aimed to analyze the COVID-19 mortality, from March to July 2020,
considering the spatio-time architectures, the socio-economic context of the
population, and using a fine granular level, in the most populous city in
Brazil. For this, we conducted an ecological study, using secondary public data
from the mortality information system. We describe mortality rates for each
epidemiological week and the entire period by sex and age. We modelled the
deaths using spatiotemporal and spatial architectures and Poisson probability
distributions in a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We obtained the
relative risks for temporal and spatiotemporal trends and socio-economic
conditions. To reduce possible sub notification, we considered the confirmed
and suspected deaths. Our findings showed an apparent stabilization of the
temporal trend, at the end of the period, but that may change in the future.
Mortality rate increased with increasing age and was higher in men. The risk of
death was greater in areas with the worst social conditions throughout the
study period. However, this was not a uniform pattern over time, since we
identified a shift from the high risk in the areas with best socio-economic
conditions to the worst ones. Our study contributed by emphasizing the
importance of geographic screening in areas with a higher risk of death, and,
currently, worse socio-economic contexts, as a crucial aspect to reducing
disease mortality and health inequities, through integrated public health
actions.

we study the implications of waning immunity for the epidemiological dynamics
and social activity. If immunity wanes, we find that COVID-19 likely becomes
endemic and that social-distancing is here to stay until the discovery of a
vaccine or cure. But waning immunity does not necessarily change optimal
actions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually
independent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized
equilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of
finding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality
rate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining
and mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that
waning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at
least 2021. This provides vital time for individuals and policymakers to learn
about immunity against SARS-CoV-2 before it becomes critical.

looking for healthcare solutions online. One class of solutions are symptom
checkers, which have become very popular in the context of COVID-19.
Traditional symptom checkers, however, are based on manually curated expert
systems that are inflexible and hard to modify, especially in a quickly
changing situation like the one we are facing today. That is why all COVID-19
existing solutions are manual symptom checkers that can only estimate the
probability of this disease and cannot contemplate alternative hypothesis or
come up with a differential diagnosis. While machine learning offers an
alternative, the lack of reliable data does not make it easy to apply to
COVID-19 either. In this paper we present an approach that combines the
strengths of traditional AI expert systems and novel deep learning models. In
doing so we can leverage prior knowledge as well as any amount of existing data
to quickly derive models that best adapt to the current state of the world and
latest scientific knowledge. We use the approach to train a COVID-19 aware
differential diagnosis model that can be used for medical decision support both
for doctors or patients. We show that our approach is able to accurately model
new incoming data about COVID-19 while still preserving accuracy on conditions
that had been modeled in the past. While our approach shows evident and clear
advantages for an extreme situation like the one we are currently facing, we
also show that its flexibility generalizes beyond this concrete, but very
important, example.

includes a detailed understanding of how agencies communicate risk information
through social media during a pandemic and influence community response (i.e.
timing of lockdown, timing of reopening) and disease outbreak indicators (i.e.
number of confirmed cases, number of deaths). The data includes Twitter
interactions from different agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and
crowdsourced data (i.e. Worldometer) on COVID-19 cases and deaths were observed

agency-levels variations over time in circulating information about the

tracing. In addition, agencies showed differences in their discussions about
community transmission, lack of personal protective equipment, testing and
medical supplies, use of tobacco, vaccine, mental health issues,

Findings could support more efficient transfer of risk and response information

The practice of social distance attracts attention as a measure to prevent the

previous studies, the scale of factors that determine social distance has been
developed. However, it was not clear how to select the items among them, and it
seemed to be somewhat arbitrary. In response to this trend, this paper
extracted eight scales by performing exploratory factor analysis based on
certain rules while eliminating arbitrariness as much as possible. They were
Adverse Conditions, Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression,
Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal
Teamwork. Of these, Adverse Conditions, Response to Aggression, and Horizontal
Teamwork had a positive correlation with Physical Proximity, and Information
Processing, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, and Communication with the Outside
had a negative correlation with Physical Proximity. Furthermore, as a result of
multiple regression analysis, it was shown that Response to Aggression, not the

cytokine storm associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is central to pyroptosis,
which may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be
inhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a
single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3
inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory
intervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is
formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that
describe the dynamics of the biological components involved in pyroptosis. Our
results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation of
the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from
inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell
model is being implemented in a SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator, in collaboration
with a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics of
COVID-19. In this paper, we provide an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 Tissue

  pandemic growth","Real-world growth processes, such as epidemic growth, are inherently noisy,
uncertain and often involve multiple growth phases. The logistic-sigmoid
function has been suggested and applied in the domain of modelling such growth
processes. However, existing definitions are limiting, as they do not consider
growth as restricted in two-dimension. Additionally, as the number of growth
phases increase, the modelling and estimation of logistic parameters becomes
more cumbersome, requiring more complex tools and analysis. To remedy this, we
introduce the nlogistic-sigmoid function as a compact, unified modern
definition of logistic growth for modelling such real-world growth phenomena.
Also, we introduce two characteristic metrics of the logistic-sigmoid curve
that can give more robust projections on the state of the growth process in
each dimension. Specifically, we apply this function to modelling the daily
World Health Organization published COVID-19 time-series data of infection and
death cases of the world and countries of the world to date. Our results
demonstrate statistically significant goodness of fit greater than or equal to
99% for affected countries of the world exhibiting patterns of either single or
multiple stages of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, such as the USA.
Consequently, this modern logistic definition and its metrics, as a machine
learning tool, can help to provide clearer and more robust monitoring and
quantification of the ongoing pandemic growth process.

  matter","I critique a recent analysis (Miles, Stedman & Heald, 2020) of COVID-19
lockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.
(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit
of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks
from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the
benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000
deaths weekly by mid-September.
  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and
cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut
off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they
assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths
and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes
that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or
social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary
lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under
these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of
serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for
survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in
deaths.
  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without
estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness
costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.

Monte Carlo approach. The analyses include death's data from USA, Brazil,
Mexico, UK, India and Russia, which comprise the four countries with the
highest number of deaths/confirmed cases, as of Aug 07, 2020, according to the
WHO. The Gompertz functions were fitted to the data of weekly averaged
confirmed deaths per day by mapping the $\chi^2$ values. The uncertainties,
variances and covariances of the model parameters were calculated by
propagation. The fitted functions for the average deaths per day for USA and
India have an upward trend, with the former having a higher growth rate and
quite huge uncertainties. For Mexico, UK and Russia, the fits are consistent
with a slope down pattern. For Brazil we found a subtle trend down, but with
significant uncertainties. The USA, UK and India data shown a first peak with a
higher growth rate when compared to the second one, demonstrating the benefits
of non-pharmaceutical interventions of sanitary measures and social distance
flattening the curve. For USA, a third peak seems quite plausible, most likely
related with the recent relaxation policies. Brazil's data are satisfactorily
described by two highly overlapped Gompertz functions with similar growth
rates, suggesting a two-steps process for the pandemic spreading. The 95% CI
for the total number of deaths ($\times 10^3$) predicted by the model for Aug

estimates for the prevalences of infections are in reasonable agreement with

behaviour. For coarser, bird-eye granularity visualisation, we observed
learners' transition between types of learning activity, obtaining typed

is a potential for robotic companions to reduce loneliness. Here, we present
results from an online study showing that a change caused by COVID-19 has
affected people's perception of social robots, as companions, and that the
feeling of loneliness can drive the purchase of a social robot.

novel ideas have always been created and deployed by humanity, with varying

global health crisis. Now, perhaps for the first time in human history, almost
the whole of humanity is experiencing some form of hardship as a result of one
invisible pathogen. This once again entails novel ideas for quick eradication,
healing and recovery, whether it is healthcare, banking, travel, education or
any other. For efficient policy-making, clear trends of past, present and
future are vital for policy-makers. With the global impacts of COVID-19 so
severe, equally important is the analysis of correlations between disease
spread and various socio-economic and environmental factors. Furthermore, all
of these need to be presented in an integrated manner in real-time to
facilitate efficient policy making. To address these issues, in this study, we
report results on our development and deployment of a web-based integrated
real-time operational dashboard as an important decision support system for
COVID-19. In our study, we conducted data-driven analysis based on available
data from diverse authenticated sources to predict upcoming consequences of the

correlations between pandemic spread and important socio-economic and
environmental factors. Furthermore, we also present how outcomes of our work
can facilitate efficient policy making in this critical hour.

  Objectively?","Misinformation is an ever increasing problem that is difficult to solve for
the research community and has a negative impact on the society at large. Very
recently, the problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach to
scale up labeling efforts: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead
of relying on a few experts, a crowd of (non-expert) judges is exploited. We
follow the same approach to study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and
reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic. We
specifically target statements related to the COVID-19 health emergency, that
is still ongoing at the time of the study and has arguably caused an increase
of the amount of misinformation that is spreading online (a phenomenon for
which the term ""infodemic"" has been used). By doing so, we are able to address
(mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal issue like
health and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done: two issues
that have not been analyzed in related work. In our experiment, crowd workers
are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements, as well as to provide
evidence for the assessments as a URL and a text justification. Besides showing
that the crowd is able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements,
we also report results on many different aspects, including: agreement among
workers, the effect of different aggregation functions, of scales
transformations, and of workers background / bias. We also analyze workers
behavior, in terms of queries submitted, URLs found / selected, text
justifications, and other behavioral data like clicks and mouse actions

  Science-Based Social Distance Guidelines","COVID-19 pandemic has strikingly demonstrated how important it is to develop
fundamental knowledge related to generation, transport and inhalation of
pathogen-laden droplets and their subsequent possible fate as airborne
particles, or aerosols, in the context of human to human transmission. It is
also increasingly clear that airborne transmission is an important contributor
to rapid spreading of the disease. In this paper, we discuss the processes of
droplet generation by exhalation, their potential transformation into airborne
particles by evaporation, transport over long distances by the exhaled puff and
by ambient air turbulence, and final inhalation by the receiving host as
interconnected multiphase flow processes. A simple model for the time evolution
of droplet/aerosol concentration is presented based on a theoretical analysis
of the relevant physical processes. The modeling framework along with detailed
experiments and simulations can be used to study a wide variety of scenarios
involving breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing and in a number of
environmental conditions, as humid or dry atmosphere, confined or open
environment. Although a number of questions remain open on the physics of
evaporation and coupling with persistence of the virus, it is clear that with a
more reliable understanding of the underlying flow physics of virus
transmission one can set the foundation for an improved methodology in
designing case-specific social distancing and infection control guidelines.

derived from a superior modality (CT) serving as ground truth, projected onto
digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) to: 1) train a convolutional neural
network to quantify airspace disease on paired CXRs; and 2) compare the
DRR-trained CNN to expert human readers in the CXR evaluation of patients with
confirmed COVID-19.
  Materials and Methods: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19
patients (with positive RT-PCR), from March-May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in
the northeastern USA, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hrs. The ground
truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19 related AD (POv) was established by
manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3D masks were projected into 2D
anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to compute
area-based AD percentage (POa). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was
trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 patients, automatically segmenting lungs, AD and quantifying
POa on CXR. CNN POa results were compared to POa quantified on CXR by two
expert readers and to the POv ground-truth, by computing correlations and mean
absolute errors.
  Results: Bootstrap mean absolute error (MAE) and correlations between POa and
POv were 11.98% [11.05%-12.47%] and 0.77 [0.70-0.82] for average of expert
readers, and 9.56%-9.78% [8.83%-10.22%] and 0.78-0.81 [0.73-0.85] for the CNN,
respectively.
  Conclusion: Our CNN trained with DRR using CT-derived airspace quantification
achieved expert radiologist level of accuracy in the quantification of airspace
disease on CXR, in patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19.

the spread of the disease is significantly influenced by a small group of
active individuals and gathering venues. We find that interventions focused on
these most mobile individuals and popular venues reduce both the peak infection
rate and the total infected population while retaining high levels of social
activity. These trends are seen consistently in simulations with real human
mobility data of different scales, resolutions, and modalities from multiple
cities across the world. The observation implies that compared to broad

supporting global efforts to combat COVID-19. The versatility of AI/ML
technologies enables scientists and technologists to address an impressively
broad range of biomedical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic challenges. This
wide-reaching scientific capacity, however, also raises a diverse array of
ethical challenges. The need for researchers to act quickly and globally in
tackling SARS-CoV-2 demands unprecedented practices of open research and
responsible data sharing at a time when innovation ecosystems are hobbled by
proprietary protectionism, inequality, and a lack of public trust. Moreover,
societally impactful interventions like digital contact tracing are raising
fears of surveillance creep and are challenging widely held commitments to
privacy, autonomy, and civil liberties. Prepandemic concerns that data-driven
innovations may function to reinforce entrenched dynamics of societal inequity
have likewise intensified given the disparate impact of the virus on vulnerable
social groups and the life-and-death consequences of biased and discriminatory
public health outcomes. To address these concerns, I offer five steps that need
to be taken to encourage responsible research and innovation. These provide a
practice-based path to responsible AI/ML design and discovery centered on open,
accountable, equitable, and democratically governed processes and products.
When taken from the start, these steps will not only enhance the capacity of
innovators to tackle COVID-19 responsibly, they will, more broadly, help to

differences in work envelope, adoption strategy, and human-robot interaction
constraints. Each application category is further divided into a total of 30
subcategories based on differences in mission. The largest number of reported

everybody off-guard. The Governments across the world have responded by
imposing lock-downs, stopping/restricting travel and mandating social
distancing. On the positive side there is wide availability of information on
active cases, recoveries and deaths collected daily across regions. However,
what has been particularly challenging is to track the spread of the disease by
asymptomatic carriers termed as super-spreaders. In this paper we look at
applying Hidden Markov Model to get a better assessment of extent of spread.
The outcome of such analysis can be useful to Governments to design the
required interventions/responses in a calibrated manner. The data we have
chosen to analyze pertains to Indian scenario.

propagated throughout the world. The application of deep learning for image
classification of chest X-ray images of Covid-19 patients, could become a novel
pre-diagnostic detection methodology. However, deep learning architectures
require large labelled datasets. This is often a limitation when the subject of
research is relatively new as in the case of the virus outbreak, where dealing
with small labelled datasets is a challenge. Moreover, in the context of a new
highly infectious disease, the datasets are also highly imbalanced,with few
observations from positive cases of the new disease. In this work we evaluate
the performance of the semi-supervised deep learning architecture known as
MixMatch using a very limited number of labelled observations and highly
imbalanced labelled dataset. We propose a simple approach for correcting data
imbalance, re-weight each observationin the loss function, giving a higher
weight to the observationscorresponding to the under-represented class. For
unlabelled observations, we propose the usage of the pseudo and augmentedlabels
calculated by MixMatch to choose the appropriate weight. The MixMatch method
combined with the proposed pseudo-label based balance correction improved
classification accuracy by up to 10%, with respect to the non balanced MixMatch
algorithm, with statistical significance. We tested our proposed approach with
several available datasets using 10, 15 and 20 labelledobservations.

captured from the mobile camera which is then relayed to the AI architecture in

Doctors with a smartphone can leverage the application to save the considerable
time that standard COVID-19 tests take for preliminary diagnosis. The scarcity
of training data and class imbalance issues were effectively tackled in our
approach by the use of Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN)
and model architecture based as a Convolutional Siamese Network with attention
mechanism. The backend model was tested for robustness us-ing publicly
available datasets under two different classification
scenarios(Binary/Multiclass) with minimal and noisy data. The model achieved
pinnacle testing accuracy of 99.30% and 98.40% on the two respective scenarios,
making it completely reliable for its users. On top of that a semi-live
training scenario was introduced, which helps improve the app performance over
time as data accumulates. Overall, the problems of generalisability of complex
models and data inefficiency is tackled through the model architecture. The app
based setting with semi live training helps in ease of access to reliable
healthcare in the society, as well as help ineffective research of rare

an enormous human tragedy with dramatic economic impacts. This paper describes
the response and expected recovery process for Western Australia, where a rapid

into an expected recovery both in health and economic terms. The positive
lessons learned from this experience are documented as they emerge in order to
support other states and nations as they address this issue globally in the
near-term and consider enduring improvements for the longer term. While the
authors have personal experience in the WA context, wider observations across
Australia and selected international benchmarks are also included. Key lessons
include the importance of good health advice in Australia's interest; timely,
synchronized and aligned action at all levels of government; a program of well
communicated, aligned health and economic measures which support all in society
allowing a very high level of appropriate community behaviour, ensuring the
health system was not overloaded; innovation in telehealth, testing, pandemic
modelling, and integrated operations which also allowed essential industries to
continue; and strong border and travel controls with highly effective isolation
preventing community spread, ultimately enabling rapid elimination of the
disease from the hospital system. In combination, these demonstrate that in the
case of Western Australia the result of first eliminating the disease from the
community, and then reopening the economy progressively at a strong pace, has
enabled a world leading outcome in both in health and economic terms. The
lessons from this experience are widely applicable, shareable both as
supporting service to other regions and through knowledge transfer.

  Tracing","Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many governments suspended outdoor
activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had severe impact on the economy and
peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective
contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models
suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact
tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital
contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple
Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to
supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn
scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt
to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many
digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit
the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this
paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks,
specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving
digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers
to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we
showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks
on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our example DoS attacks
showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within
normal working hours and days.

or freedom of economic activity or a cost-benefit analysis that places economic
activity over public health. Pro-social and economic restriction discourse less
frequently mentions rights and freedoms, instead supporting restrictions as
following state and medical advice and out of deference and respect to medical
professionals. Discourse is highly polarised and divisive and articulated
largely through established political identity positions. It is suggested that
more attention is paid to discussions of balancing rights and freedoms in COVID
control restrictions. To convince opposers of restrictions, supporters of
restrictions should base arguments around communal rights and positive
freedoms. It is also important to critically evaluate whether and how these
perspectives need to be adapted to be appropriate and resonant in democratic

considerable changes in the structure of mobility networks, revealed by a

Significant increases in surface O$_{3}$ have been reported in many cities
during the COVID-19 lockdown. Here we conduct comprehensive observation and
modeling analyses of surface O$_{3}$ across China for periods before and during
the lockdown. We find that daytime O$_{3}$ decreased in the subtropical south,
in contrast to increases in most other regions. Meteorological changes and
emission reductions both contributed to the O$_{3}$ changes, with a larger
impact from the former especially in central China. The drop in nitrogen oxide
(NO$_{x}$) emission contributed to O$_{3}$ increases in populated regions,
whereas the reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOC) contributed to
O$_{3}$ decreases across the country. Due to a decreasing level of NO$_{x}$
saturation from north to south, the emission reduction in NO$_{x}$ (46%) and
VOC (32%) contributed to net O$_{3}$ increases in north China; the opposite
effects of NO$_{x}$ decrease (49%) and VOC decrease (24%) balanced out in
central China, whereas the comparable decreases (45-55%) in the two precursors
contributed to net O$_{3}$ declines in south China. Our study highlights the
complex dependence of O$_{3}$ on its precursors and the importance of
meteorology in the short-term O$_{3}$ variability.

from malicious accounts towards manipulating public opinion, have become
increasingly prevalent. There has been growing evidence of social media abuse
towards influencing politics and social issues in other countries, raising
numerous concerns. The identification and prevention of coordinated campaigns
has become critical to tackling disinformation at its source. Existing
approaches to detect malicious campaigns make strict assumptions about
coordinated behaviours, such as malicious accounts perform synchronized actions
or share features assumed to be indicative of coordination. Others require part
of the malicious accounts in the campaign to be revealed in order to detect the
rest. Such assumptions significantly limit the effectiveness of existing
approaches. In contrast, we propose AMDN (Attentive Mixture Density Network) to
automatically uncover coordinated group behaviours from account activities and
interactions between accounts, based on temporal point processes. Furthermore,
we leverage the learned model to understand and explain the behaviours of
coordinated accounts in disinformation campaigns. We find that the average
influence between coordinated accounts is the highest, whereas these accounts
are not much influenced by regular accounts. We evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method on Twitter data related to Russian interference in US
Elections. Additionally, we identify disinformation campaigns in COVID-19 data
collected from Twitter, and provide the first evidence and analysis of
existence of coordinated disinformation campaigns in the ongoing pandemic.

  Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs","Automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis based on Chest X-ray
(CXR) imaging is important for faster examination. We propose a novel approach,
called DRR4Covid, to learn automated COVID-19 diagnosis and infection
segmentation on CXRs from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRR4Covid
comprises of an infection-aware DRR generator, a classification and/or
segmentation network, and a domain adaptation module. The infection-aware DRR
generator is able to produce DRRs with adjustable strength of radiological
signs of COVID-19 infection, and generate pixel-level infection annotations
that match the DRRs precisely. The domain adaptation module is introduced to
reduce the domain discrepancy between DRRs and CXRs by training networks on
unlabeled real CXRs and labeled DRRs together.We provide a simple but effective
implementation of DRR4Covid by using a domain adaptation module based on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a FCN-based network with a classification
header and a segmentation header. Extensive experiment results have confirmed
the efficacy of our method; specifically, quantifying the performance by
accuracy, AUC and F1-score, our network without using any annotations from CXRs
has achieved a classification score of (0.954, 0.989, 0.953) and a segmentation
score of (0.957, 0.981, 0.956) on a test set with 794 normal cases and 794
positive cases. Besides, we estimate the sensitive of X-ray images in detecting
COVID-19 infection by adjusting the strength of radiological signs of COVID-19
infection in synthetic DRRs. The estimated detection limit of the proportion of
infected voxels in the lungs is 19.43%, and the estimated lower bound of the
contribution rate of infected voxels is 20.0% for significant radiological
signs of COVID-19 infection. Our codes will be made publicly available at

  acid and baloxavir marboxil against COVID-19","The main reasons for the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic
are the unavailability of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines along with
the human to human transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus. So, there is urgent
need to search appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs.
In this communication, molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviral
drugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with the
three therapeutic target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease
(PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking results
of both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigational
drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drug
BXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock score
revealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of RdRp than
BXM. The computational molecular docking revealed that the drug BXA may be more
effective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.

herd immunity to be reached. We quantify the difference between the size of the
infected population when the effective reproduction number decreases below 1

sheds light on an important distinction between herd immunity and the end of

capacity planning. In many situations, reliable data is not available. We
introduce the BuB simulator, which requires only the specification of plausible
intervals for the simulation parameters. By performing a surrogate-model based

Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis can be performed, which allows
deep insights into the most important model parameters and their interactions.
This information can be used to screen the parameters that should be further
investigated. To exemplify our approach, a capacity and resource planning task
for a hospital was simulated and optimized. The study explicitly covers
difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be shown, that even if
only limited real-world data is available, the BuB simulator can be
beneficially used to consider worst- and best-case scenarios. The BuB simulator
can be extended in many ways, e.g., by adding further resources (personal
protection equipment, staff, pharmaceuticals) or by specifying several cohorts
(based on age, health status, etc.).

  Rate in Early Phase of COVID-19 Epidemic via Regularised Multi-task Feature
  Learning","Recent outbreak of COVID-19 has led a rapid global spread around the world.
Many countries have implemented timely intensive suppression to minimize the
infections, but resulted in high case fatality rate (CFR) due to critical
demand of health resources. Other country-based factors such as sociocultural
issues, ageing population etc., has also influenced practical effectiveness of
taking interventions to improve morality in early phase. To better understand
the relationship of these factors across different countries with COVID-19 CFR
is of primary importance to prepare for potentially second wave of COVID-19
infections. In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task learning
based factor analysis approach for quantifying country-based factors affecting
CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. We formulate the prediction of CFR
progression as a ML regression problem with observed CFR and other
countries-based factors. In this formulation, all CFR related factors were
categorized into 6 sectors with 27 indicators. We proposed a hybrid feature
selection method combining filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate
initial factors for a preliminary feature interaction. Then we adopted two
typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) and one state-of-the-art
MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) in our formulation. The fused sparse
group Lasso (FSGL) method allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of
country-based factors for multiple time points of COVID-19 epidemic and also
enables incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the whole early
phase period. Finally, we proposed one novel temporal voting feature selection
scheme to balance the weight instability of multiple factors in our MTFL model.

infection combined with quarantine for contacts of infected individuals affects
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and levels of related mortality. Practices
for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For
example, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is
the highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for
COVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population,
while the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting
limited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg.
Methods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality
ratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and
deaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results:
The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for
COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is
0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability
of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for
COVID-19 are relatively high. Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2
infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality from
COVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test all individuals with
respiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to
undertake additional measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Such measures, in combination with quarantine for infected cases and their
close contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and
diminish the related mortality.

for spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied by the same group of people,
e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols to
assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at

infections arising from a single regular attendee becoming infectious and
remaining pre/asymptomatic, i.e. we present a robust methodology to calculate
the absolute reproductive number of these spaces. We demonstrate our model by
calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored
data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. Results suggest that
attendance at work is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic if
relatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate
ventilation. However, these spaces are likely to contribute significantly to
the pandemic if ventilation is inadequate and/or activity levels increase.

metrics that help define the loss of known information while transferring data

opposite process: the harvesting of new information. Correlation functions and
correlation coefficients do play an important role in collecting new
information from noisy sources. However, Bershad and Rockmore [1974] based
their formulas on contradictory a priori assumptions in Real-space and in
Fourier-space. Their formulations were subsequently copied literally to the
practical science of electron microscopy, where those a priori assumptions now
distort most quality metrics in Cryo-EM. Cryo-EM became a great success in
recent years [Wiley Award 2017; Nobel prize for Chemistry 2017] and became the
method of choice for revealing structures of biological complexes like

current COVID-19 pandemic. Those early misconceptions now interfere with the
objective comparison of independently obtained results. We found that the roots
of these problems significantly pre-date those 1970s publications and were
already inherent in the original SNR definitions. We here propose novel metrics
to assess the amount of information harvested in an experiment, information
which is measured in bits. These new metrics assess the total amount of
information collected on an object, as well as the information density
distribution within that object. The new metrics can be applied everywhere
where data is collected, processed, compressed, or compared. As an example, we
compare the structures of two recently published SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We

  Application to COVID-19 Model Selection","Model selection is a fundamental part of the applied Bayesian statistical
methodology. Metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion are commonly used
in practice to select models but do not incorporate the uncertainty of the
models' parameters and can give misleading choices. One approach that uses the
full posterior distribution is to compute the ratio of two models' normalising
constants, known as the Bayes factor. Often in realistic problems, this
involves the integration of analytically intractable, high-dimensional
distributions, and therefore requires the use of stochastic methods such as
thermodynamic integration (TI). In this paper we apply a variation of the TI
method, referred to as referenced TI, which computes a single model's
normalising constant in an efficient way by using a judiciously chosen
reference density. The advantages of the approach and theoretical
considerations are set out, along with explicit pedagogical 1 and 2D examples.
Benchmarking is presented with comparable methods and we find favourable
convergence performance. The approach is shown to be useful in practice when
applied to a real problem - to perform model selection for a semi-mechanistic
hierarchical Bayesian model of COVID-19 transmission in South Korea involving
the integration of a 200D density.

  data analysis and optimal testing prescription","In this study, we address three important challenges related to the COVID-19
pandemic, namely, (a) providing an early warning to likely exposed individuals,
(b) identifying asymptomatic individuals, and (c) prescription of optimal
testing when testing capacity is limited. First, we present a dynamic-graph
based SEIR epidemiological model in order to describe the dynamics of the
disease transmission. Our model considers a dynamic graph/network that accounts
for the interactions between individuals over time, such as the ones obtained
by manual or automated contact tracing, and uses a diffusion-reaction mechanism
to describe the state dynamics. This dynamic graph model helps identify likely
exposed/infected individuals to whom we can provide early warnings, even before
they display any symptoms. When COVID-19 testing capacity is limited compared
to the population size, reliable estimation of individual's health state and
disease transmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging.
Thus, estimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk
assessment, as well as for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing
prescription. Therefore, we propose the use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos
Expansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification, to
represent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This
design enables us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and
consequently optimize the testing as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a
constrained testing budget. We present a few simulation results that illustrate
the performance of the proposed framework, and estimate the impact of
incomplete contact tracing data.

compartment (with four states) SIR(D) model. Our approach is similar to
non-parametric curve fitting in spirit and automatically adapts to key external
factors, such as interventions, while retaining the parsimonious nature of the
standard SIR(D) model. Initial dynamic temporal estimates of the model
parameters are obtained by minimising the aggregate residual sum of squares
across the number of infections, recoveries, and fatalities, over a chosen lag
period. Then a geometric smoother is applied to obtain the final time series of
estimates. These estimates are used to obtain dynamic temporal robust estimates
of the key feature of this pandemic, namely the ""reproduction number"". We
illustrate our method on the Indian COVID-19 data for the period March 14 -
August 31, 2020. The time series data plots of the 36 states and union
territories shows a clear presence of inter-regional variation in the prognosis
of the epidemic. This is also bourne out by the estimates of the underlying
parameters, including the reproduction numbers for the 36 regions. Due to this,
an SIR(D) model, dynamic or otherwise, on the national aggregate data is not
suited for robust local predictions. The time series of estimates of the model
enables us to carry out daily, weekly and also long term predictions, including
construction of predictive bands. We obtain an excellent agreement between the
actual data and the model predicted data at the regional level. Our estimates
of the current reproduction number turn out to be more than 2 in three regions
(Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) and between 1.5 and 2 in 13
regions. Each of these regions have experienced an individual trajectory, which
typically involves initial phase of shock(s) followed by a relatively steady
lower level of the reproduction number.

patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients
with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require
expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have
negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce
COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored
for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven
design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark
CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National
Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases.
Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an

France. We assume that the positivity of asymptomatic people not being contact
cases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French
population, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using
Sant\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August
was about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning
of September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously
infected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce
that intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate
(IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036%
and 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on
the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France,
Ile de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations
are using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45
(1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which
occurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated
incidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks
induces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An
incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total
number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000
respectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed
close to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual
immunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of
October 2020. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously
thought, but its severity became limited since the end of the first wave.

observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools
or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of
infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual
tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they
are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial
observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior
over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations
sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our
framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody,
antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional
screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens
or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this
challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method
which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective.
Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method
produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for
estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.

on surfaces with lifespan of more than hours. To curb its spread, it is hence
of vital importance to detect and quarantine those who have been in contact
with the virus for sustained period of time, the so-called close contacts. In
this work, we study, for the first time, automatic contact detection when the
virus has a lifespan. Leveraging upon the ubiquity of WiFi signals, we propose
a novel, private, and fully distributed WiFi-based approach called vContact.
Users installing an app continuously scan WiFi and store its hashed IDs. Given
a confirmed case, the signals of the major places he/she visited are then
uploaded to a server and matched with the stored signals of users to detect
contact. vContact is not based on phone pairing, and no information of any
other users is stored locally. The confirmed case does not need to have
installed the app for it to work properly. As WiFi data are sampled
sporadically, we propose efficient signal processing approaches and similarity
metric to align and match signals of any time. We conduct extensive indoor and
outdoor experiments to evaluate the performance of vContact. Our results
demonstrate that vContact is efficient and robust for contact detection. The
precision and recall of contact detection are high (in the range of 50-90%) for
close contact proximity (2m). Its performance is robust with respect to signal
lengths (AP numbers) and phone heterogeneity. By implementing vContact as an
app, we present a case study to demonstrate the validity of our design in
notifying its users their exposure to virus with lifespan.

international public health agencies, who have activated their pandemic plans
and opened the epidemiological toolkit of modelling, testing, isolation and
movement restrictions, surveillance, and contact tracing. In the contemporary
tech-heavy world, many assumed that the common manual process of human
investigators and phone calls could or should be replaced by digital solutions.
But it's not as simple as ""add more technology"" - the complex way in which
users and societies interact with the technology has significant impacts on
effectiveness. When efforts are not well co-ordinated, fragmentation in system
design and user experience can negatively impact the public health response.

digital diaries evolved in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
initial poor outcomes caused by the lack of central co-ordination, and the

consisting of 829 images from 9 CT scan volumes for testing. Multiple findings
are provided including the best architecture-encoder models for each experiment

`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such
lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study
examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact
through supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an
agent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in
Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the
interactions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by
decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We
find that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier
substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the
economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region
lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on
whether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked
through supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy
coordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.

in recent decades caused by geopolitical upheavals such as Brexit and now,
COVID-19. The way in which policy makers respond to the current pandemic could
have large effects on how the world looks after the pandemic subsides. We aim
to investigate complex questions post COVID-19 around the relationships and
intersections concerning nationalism, religiosity, and anti-immigrant sentiment
from a socio-cognitive perspective by applying a mixed-method approach (survey
and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion threats have caused
huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature
on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the
role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can
fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's
life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's
life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural
disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing).
These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and
other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist
and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin
to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our
theoretical framework and explore the different possible relationships in an
online sample. The second is a study of a computer simulation. Both studies
(completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables,

  mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic using global mobility data","The implementation of governmental Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs)
has been the primary means of controlling the spread of the COVID-19 disease.
The intended effect of these NPIs has been to reduce mobility. A strong
reduction in mobility is believed to have a positive effect on the reduction of
COVID-19 transmission by limiting the opportunity for the virus to spread in
the population. Due to the huge costs of implementing these NPIs, it is
essential to have a good understanding of their efficacy. Using global mobility
data, released by Apple and Google, and ACAPS NPI data, we investigate the
proportional contribution of NPIs on i) size of the change (magnitude) of
transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) rate
(gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best
fit model we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to
impact the magnitude of the change in mobility were: Lockdown measures (Apple,
Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS)),
declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS), closure of
businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using
cluster analysis and chi square tests we found that closure of businesses and
public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings as well as
border closures and international flight suspensions were closely related. The
implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings had the
greatest effect on the rate of mobility change. In conclusion, we were able to
quantitatively assess the efficacy of NPIs in reducing mobility, which enables
us to understand their fine grained effects in a timely manner and therefore
facilitate well-informed and cost-effective interventions.

  in Computed Tomography Scans: An Ablation Study","Amidst the ongoing pandemic, several studies have shown that COVID-19
classification and grading using computed tomography (CT) images can be
automated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Many of these studies
focused on reporting initial results of algorithms that were assembled from
commonly used components. The choice of these components was often pragmatic
rather than systematic. For instance, several studies used 2D CNNs even though
these might not be optimal for handling 3D CT volumes. This paper identifies a
variety of components that increase the performance of CNN-based algorithms for
COVID-19 grading from CT images. We investigated the effectiveness of using a
3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN, of using transfer learning to initialize the
network, of providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network
input, and of predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D CNN
with these components achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934 on
our test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.923 on a publicly available set of
742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously
published 2D CNN. An ablation study demonstrated that in addition to using a 3D
CNN instead of a 2D CNN transfer learning contributed the most and continuous
output contributed the least to improving the model performance.

9, 50, 625 deaths in 212 countries over the last few months. Different drug
intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of COVID-19 can
substantially reduce the infection induced mortality. The current within-host
mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal drug regimen and the
efficacy of combined therapy in treatment of COVID-19. The drugs/interventions
considered include Arbidol, Remdesivir, Inteferon (INF) and
Lopinavir/Ritonavir. It is concluded that these drug interventions when
administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and viral
load. Four scenarios involving administration of single drug intervention, two
drug interventions, three drug interventions and all the four have been
discussed. In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on
two methods. In the first method these medical interventions are modeled as
control interventions and a corresponding objective function and optimal
control problem is formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is
proposed. Later using the the comparative effectiveness method the optimal drug
regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction number and viral load. The
average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four
interventions were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible
cell count decreased the best when Arbidol alone was administered. The basic
reproduction number and viral count decreased the best when all the four
interventions were applied together reinstating the fact obtained earlier in
the optimal control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision
making in treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.

importance of chest x-ray data in studying COVID-19, there is a demand for
state-of-the-art models capable of precisely segmenting soft tissue on the
chest x-rays. The dataset for exploring best segmentation model is from
Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital which had opened in 2014. The most famous
technique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the
Chest X-rays. However, most variant U-Nets mainly focus on extraction of
contextual information and skip connections. There is still a large space for
improving extraction of spatial features. In this paper, we propose a dual
encoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception
Convolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent
Convolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net. The densely connected
recurrent path extends the network deeper for facilitating contextual feature
extraction. In order to increase the width of network and enrich representation
of features, the inception blocks with dilation are adopted. The inception
blocks can capture globally and locally spatial information from various
receptive fields. At the same time, the two paths are fused by summing
features, thus preserving the contextual and spatial information for decoding
part. This multi-learning-scale model is benefiting in Chest X-ray dataset from
two different manufacturers (Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital). The DEFU-Net
achieves the better performance than basic U-Net, residual U-Net, BCDU-Net,

communities and the COVID19 pandemic. This study reports a COVID19
Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identification and mapping of vulnerable
counties in the United States. We proposed a Random Forest machine learning
based COVID19 vulnerability model using CDC sociodemographic and
COVID19-specific themes. An innovative COVID19 Impact Assessment algorithm was
also developed using homogeneity and trend assessment technique for evaluating
severity of the pandemic in all counties and train RF model. Developed C19VI
was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID19 Community
Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI along with census data, we
explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID19 health
outcomes amongst different regions in the United States. Our C19VI index
indicates that 18.30% of the counties falls into very high vulnerability class,
24.34% in high, 23.32% in moderate, 22.34% in low, and 11.68% in very low.
Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities and 82.84% of
economically poor communities are very high or high COVID19 vulnerable regions.
The proposed approach of vulnerability modeling takes advantage of both the
well-established field of statistical analysis and the fast-evolving domain of
machine learning. C19VI provides an accurate and more reliable way to measure
county level vulnerability in the United States. This index aims at helping
emergency planners to develop more effective mitigation strategies especially
for the disproportionately impacted communities.

influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as
symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns

forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework
enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize
learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the
historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI
data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate
that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to

adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with

stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can
prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social

epidemiological models are either based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact

the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the novel

regional scales, leaving the archived datasets to limited use. While it is
often hypothesized that population density is a significant driver in disease
propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection rates exhibited
by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution
description of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the
impact of the creation of containment zones on travel patterns within the city.
Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious disease model to

social distancing remains untackled in academy. Beyond isolated efforts (from
sidewalk widenings to car-free Open Streets), there is a need for a large-scale
and quantitative strategy for cities to handle the challenges that COVID-19
poses in the use of public space. The main obstacle is a generalized lack of
publicly available data on sidewalk infrastructure worldwide, and thus city
governments have not yet benefited from a complex systems approach of treating
urban sidewalks as networks. Here, we leverage sidewalk geometries from ten
cities in three continents, to first analyze sidewalk and roadbed geometries,
and find that cities most often present an arrogant distribution of public
space: imbalanced and unfair with respect to pedestrians. Then, we connect
these geometries to build a sidewalk network --adjacent, but not assimilable to
road networks, so fertile in urban science. In a no-intervention scenario, we
apply percolation theory to examine whether the sidewalk infrastructure in
cities can withstand the tight pandemic social distancing imposed on our
streets. The resulting collapse of sidewalk networks, often at widths below
three meters, calls for a cautious strategy, taking into account the
interdependencies between a city's sidewalk and road networks, as any
improvement for pedestrians comes at a cost for motor transport. With notable

  based on human contact","A wide range of approaches have been applied to manage the spread of global
pandemic events such as COVID-19, which have met with varying degrees of
success. Given the large-scale social and economic impact coupled with the
increasing time span of the pandemic, it is important to not only manage the
spread of the disease but also put extra efforts on measures that expedite
resumption of social and economic life. It is therefore important to identify
situations that carry high risk, and act early whenever such situations are
identified. While a large number of mobile applications have been developed,
they are aimed at obtaining information that can be used for contact tracing,
but not at estimating the risk of social situations. In this paper, we
introduce an infection risk score that provides an estimate of the infection
risk arising from human contacts. Using a real-world human contact dataset, we
show that the proposed risk score can provide a realistic estimate of the level
of risk in the population. We also describe how the proposed infection risk
score can be implemented on smartphones. Finally, we identify representative
use cases that can leverage the risk score to minimize infection propagation.

health around the world by causing the infectious coronavirus disease 2019

asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (ACCs) that makes breaking the transmission chains

STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal
episodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs
can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the
episodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the
effectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is

results based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model
is able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and

outbreak with more than 29 million confirmed cases and around 1 million

popular models for COVID-19 forecasting, statistical models are receiving much

long term forecasting, as there is high level of uncertainty and required data
is also not sufficiently available. In this paper, we propose a comparative

detection on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable

simple stochastic model for epidemics in a two type population. Apart from the
size of the population of the vulnerable and the fit, and the initial number of

processes. Results may be counterintuitive. The average number of vulnerable
persons infected by an infectious fit person is a crucial parameter of the
epidemic in the two type population. Intuitively this parameter should be
small. However simulations show that even if this parameter is small the death
toll may be higher than without shielding. Under certain conditions increasing

  Generation via Risk Estimation","Understanding the relationships between biomedical terms like viruses, drugs,
and symptoms is essential in the fight against diseases. Many attempts have
been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of
hypothesis generation(HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit
connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to
truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also
assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative
(PN) learning setting). To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as
future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via
positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal
evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and
unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the
positive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings,
which are then used for link prediction. Experiment results on real-world
biomedical term relationship datasets and case study analyses on a COVID-19
dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

  COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese mainland","Revealing spatiotemporal evolution regularity in the spatial diffusion of
epidemics is helpful for preventing and controlling the spread of epidemics.
Based on the real-time COVID-19 datasets by prefecture-level cities and date,
this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling in spatial diffusion
pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese
mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract
spatial data and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal
parameters. The results show multifractal distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in
China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped
curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean
dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity
spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal
dimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped curves. From these
spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows.
First, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic,
which seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of
COVID-19 across China can be characterized by global clustering with local
disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 in China
experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the
hierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study
suggests that multifractal theory can be utilized to characterize
spatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic, and the case analyses may be
instructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.

  Early Cases of COVID-19","As of September 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate the health
and well-being of the global population. With more than 33 million confirmed
cases and over a million deaths, global health organizations are still a long
way from fully containing the pandemic. This pandemic has raised serious
questions about the emergency preparedness of health agencies, not only in
terms of treatment of an unseen disease, but also in identifying its early
symptoms. In the particular case of COVID-19, several studies have indicated
that chest radiography images of the infected patients show characteristic
abnormalities. However, at the onset of a given pandemic, such as COVID-19,
there may not be sufficient data for the affected cases to train models for
their robust detection. Hence, supervised classification is ill-posed for this
problem because the time spent in collecting large amounts of infected peoples'
data could lead to the loss of human lives and delays in preventive
interventions. Therefore, we formulate this problem within a one-class
classification framework, in which the data for healthy patients is abundantly
available, whereas no training data is present for the class of interest
(COVID-19 in our case). To solve this problem, we present COVIDomaly, a
convolutional autoencoder framework to detect unseen COVID-19 cases from the
chest radiographs. We tested two settings on a publicly available dataset
(COVIDx) by training the model on chest X-rays from (i) only healthy adults,
and (ii) healthy and other non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and detected COVID-19 as an
anomaly. After performing 3-fold cross validation, we obtain a pooled ROC-AUC
of 0.7652 and 0.6902 in the two settings respectively. These results are very
encouraging and pave the way towards research for ensuring emergency
preparedness in future pandemics, especially the ones that could be detected
from chest X-rays.

necessarily correlate with government policies and guidelines, but is more
related to people's awareness of the pandemic, which is reflected by the search

the mobility patterns to adjust to the new situation. From the spatial
perspective, we conduct a state-level network analysis and clustering using the
mobility data from Multiscale Dynamic Human Mobility Flow Dataset. As a result,
we find that 1) states in the same cluster have shorter geographical distances;
2) a 14-day delay again is found between the time when the largest number of
clusters appears and the peak of Coronavirus-related search queries on Google

  challenges","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency
of international concern affecting more than 200 countries and territories
worldwide. As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with
more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported
deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have
previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected
countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series
data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging
job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and
machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting
has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to
insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of
estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past
evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors,
lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter
focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast
the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical
study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that
there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic
data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation
of healthcare resources and will act as an early-warning system for government
policymakers.

  Mobile Contact Tracing Applications","In 2020 the coronavirus outbreak changed the lives of people worldwide. After
an initial time period in which it was unclear how to battle the virus, social
distancing has been recognised globally as an effective method to mitigate the
disease spread. This called for technological tools such as Mobile Contact
Tracing Applications (MCTA), which are used to digitally trace contacts among
people, and in case a positive case is found, people with the application
installed which had been in contact will be notified. De-centralised MCTA may
suffer from a novel kind of privacy attack, based on the memory of the human
beings, which upon notification of the application can identify who is the
positive individual responsible for the notification. Our results show that it
is indeed possible to identify positive people among the group of contacts of a
human being, and this is even easier when the sociability of the positive
individual is low. In practice, our simulation results show that identification
can be made with an accuracy of more than 90% depending on the scenario. We
also provide three mitigation strategies which can be implemented in
de-centralised MCTA and analyse which of the three are more effective in
limiting this novel kind of attack.

Medicine, though often accompanying with unendurable costs and risks. To
optimize the design of clinical trials, we introduce a novel Clinical Trial
Result Prediction (CTRP) task. In the CTRP framework, a model takes a
PICO-formatted clinical trial proposal with its background as input and
predicts the result, i.e. how the Intervention group compares with the
Comparison group in terms of the measured Outcome in the studied Population.
While structured clinical evidence is prohibitively expensive for manual
collection, we exploit large-scale unstructured sentences from medical
literature that implicitly contain PICOs and results as evidence. Specifically,
we pre-train a model to predict the disentangled results from such implicit
evidence and fine-tune the model with limited data on the downstream datasets.
Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the
proposed model outperforms the baselines by large margins, e.g., with a 10.7%
relative gain over BioBERT in macro-F1. Moreover, the performance improvement
is also validated on another dataset composed of clinical trials related to

actively and effectively polarising the discourse by 'hashjacking' COVID-19
related hashtags, like #CoronaVirusDE or #FlattenTheCurve. This polarisation
strategy is dominated by the activity of a limited set of heavy users. The
results underline the necessity to understand the dynamics of discourse

may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the
efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development.
We provide a strategy to prioritize the selection of mutations for designing

systems incapacitated to diagnose and test patients at the needed rate. Studies
have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial
pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images
can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack
sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction

networks (CNN) need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the
task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires
time and resources which could further strain health care systems and
radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study,
we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects
images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal
and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the
unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available
COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia,
and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use
transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why
segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the
task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from
different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show
improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model

in confirming cases. Having information on changes in the epidemic evolution or
outbreaks rise before lab-confirmation is crucial in decision making for Public
Health policies. We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of
COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling
the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional
to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with
coefficient of determination $R^2 > 0.85$. This result allows us to estimate
the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days

We show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present
the Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance to lab results. One key
point in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in
the estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a
main indicator to detect an anomaly. We present the details of the explicit

approaches hold the potential for triaging potential candidates far more
quickly than their experimental counterparts. These methods have been widely
used to search for small molecules that can inhibit critical proteins involved

protease Mpro, an enzyme that cleaves the viral polyproteins into individual
proteins required for viral replication and transcription. Unfortunately,
standard computational screening methods face difficulties in ranking diverse
ligands to a receptor due to disparate ligand scaffolds and varying charge
states. Here, we describe full density functional quantum mechanical (DFT/QM)
simulations of Mpro in complex with various ligands to obtain absolute ligand
binding energies. Our calculations are enabled by a new cloud-native parallel
DFT/QM implementation running on computational resources from Amazon Web
Services (AWS). The results we obtain are promising: the approach is quite
capable of scoring a very diverse set of existing drug compounds for their
affinities to Mpro and suggest the DFT/QM approach is potentially more broadly
applicable to repurpose screening against this target. In addition, each DFT/QM
simulation required only ~1 hour (wall clock time) per ligand. The fast
turnaround time raises the practical possibility of a broad application of
large-scale quantum mechanics in the drug discovery pipeline at stages where

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
evolved into an unprecedented pandemic. Currently, with unavailable
pharmaceutical treatments and vaccines, this novel coronavirus results in a
great impact on public health, human society, and global economy, which is
likely to last for many years. One of the lessons learned from the COVID-19
pandemic is that a long-term system with non-pharmaceutical interventions for
preventing and controlling new infectious diseases is desirable to be
implemented. Internet of things (IoT) platform is preferred to be utilized to
achieve this goal, due to its ubiquitous sensing ability and seamless
connectivity. IoT technology is changing our lives through smart healthcare,
smart home, and smart city, which aims to build a more convenient and
intelligent community. This paper presents how the IoT could be incorporated
into the epidemic prevention and control system. Specifically, we demonstrate a
potential fog-cloud combined IoT platform that can be used in the systematic
and intelligent COVID-19 prevention and control, which involves five
interventions including COVID-19 Symptom Diagnosis, Quarantine Monitoring,
Contact Tracing & Social Distancing, COVID-19 Outbreak Forecasting, and
SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Tracking. We investigate and review the state-of-the-art
literatures of these five interventions to present the capabilities of IoT in
countering against the current COVID-19 pandemic or future infectious disease
epidemics.

  chest X-ray images via novel Pinball-OCSVM","It is evident that the infection with this severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) starts with the upper respiratory tract and as the
virus grows, the infection can progress to lungs and develop pneumonia.
According to the statistics, approximately 14\% of the infected people with
COVID-19 have severe cough and shortness of breath due to pneumonia, because as
the viral infection increases, it damages the alveoli (small air sacs) and
surrounding tissues. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive
during early stages specially, if the patient is asymptomatic that may further
lead to more severe pneumonia. To overcome this problem an early diagnosis
method is proposed in this paper via one-class classification approach using a
novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM)
considering posteroanterior chest X-ray images. Recently, several automated
COVID-19 diagnosis models have been proposed based on various deep learning
architectures to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest
X-ray (CXR) where the presence of less number of COVID-19 positive samples
compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the
challenge for unbiased learning in deep learning models that has been solved
using class balancing techniques which however should be avoided in any medical
diagnosis process. Inspired by this phenomenon, this article proposes a novel
PB-OCSVM model to work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples
with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency while minimize the
false-positive and false-negative predictions. The proposed model outperformed
over recently published deep learning approaches where accuracy, precision,
specificity and sensitivity are used as performance measure parameters.

  Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network","The purpose of this study was to develop a fully-automated segmentation
algorithm, robust to various density enhancing lung abnormalities, to
facilitate rapid quantitative analysis of computed tomography images. A
polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled
left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of
animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural
network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung
regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation.
Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively
evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer,
and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar
segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input
to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using
hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The
proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using
semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images,
achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and
Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four
radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated
and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently
more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe
cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach
was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation
without requiring COVID-19 cases for training.

exploring the relationship between datasets. The estimation of sparse canonical

rate-optimal estimators for sparse canonical correlation vectors are expensive
to compute. We propose a quasi-Bayesian estimation procedure that achieves the
minimax estimation rate, and yet is easy to compute by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). The method builds on ([37]) and uses a re-scaled Rayleigh quotient
function as a quasi-log-likelihood. However unlike these authors, we adopt a
Bayesian framework that combines this quasi-log-likelihood with a
spike-and-slab prior that serves to regularize the inference and promote
sparsity. We investigated the empirical behavior of the proposed method on both
continuous and truncated data, and we noted that it outperforms several

COVID-19 treatment discovery. To support the computational power necessary to
learn a DNN, cloud environments with dedicated hardware support have emerged as
critical infrastructure. However, there are many integrity challenges
associated with outsourcing computation. Various approaches have been developed
to address these challenges, building on trusted execution environments (TEE).
Yet, no existing approach scales up to support realistic integrity-preserving
DNN model training for heavy workloads (deep architectures and millions of
training examples) without sustaining a significant performance hit. To
mitigate the time gap between pure TEE (full integrity) and pure GPU (no
integrity), we combine random verification of selected computation steps with
systematic adjustments of DNN hyper-parameters (e.g., a narrow gradient
clipping range), hence limiting the attacker's ability to shift the model
parameters significantly provided that the step is not selected for
verification during its training phase. Experimental results show the new
approach achieves 2X to 20X performance improvement over pure TEE based
solution while guaranteeing a very high probability of integrity (e.g., 0.999)

For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR
so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge
feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and
regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective
and robust for prediction. The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves
the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US,
out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and

analysis for regional cluster modelling and analysis is essential in the
situations where there is significant multicollinearity among several
parameters, especially when the dimensionality of regional data is measured in
tens. The proposed principal components model allows for same-quality
representation of the clustering of regions. In fact, the clusters become more
distinctive and the apparent outliers become either more pronounced with the
component model clustering or are alleviated with the respective hierarchical
cluster. Thus, a five-component model was obtained and validated upon 85
regions of Russian Federation and 19 socio-economic parameters. The principal
components allowed to describe approximately 75 percent of the initial
parameters variation and enable further simulations upon the studied variables.
The cluster analysis upon the principal components modelling enabled better
exposure of regional structure and disparity in economic development in Russian
Federation, consisting of four main clusters: the few-numbered highest
development regions, the clusters with mid-to-high and low economic
development, and the ""poorest"" regions. It is observable that the development

countries have gone through the lockdown process to reduce the health impact of
Covid-19. As countries have started lifting Covid-19 related restrictions,
businesses have been allowed to again have on-site customers. However, just a
limited number of people are being allowed on-site as long as social distancing
measures are being followed. This has resulted in heavy burdens on businesses
as their number of customers have decreased substantially. In this study, we
propose a model to minimize the economic impact of Covid-19 for businesses that
have implemented social distancing measures, as well as to minimize the health
impact of Covid-19 for their customers and employees. We introduce the quantity
Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and arrangement of
people at a given site while applying social distancing measures. We apply our
model to a real-world scenario and optimize the number of passengers and their
arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular
aircraft seat layouts using the Annealing Monte Carlo technique. We obtain the
optimal numbers and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family
groups and individual passengers for the social distancing measure. The
obtained optimal arrangements of passengers show complex patterns with groups
and individual passengers mixed in complex and non-trivial ways. This
demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its variants to find these
optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other arrangements of

transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protection
measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public's awareness of
the time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We
propose a robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of
SARS-CoV-2 at all US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths,
and we develop the daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a
susceptible individual to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in
community. We found that shortening only $5\%$ of the infectious period of
SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around $39\%$ (or $78$K, $95\%$ CI: $[66$K $, 89$K $]$)
of the COVID-19 associated deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our
findings also indicate that the reduction of infection and deaths by shortened
infectious period is more pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction
number close to 1, suggesting that testing should be used along with other
mitigation measures, such as social distancing and facial mask wearing, to
reduce the transmission rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level
map for local officials to determine optimal policy responses, and for public
to better understand the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 on each day.

emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. As of October 13, the outbreak has
spread rapidly across the world, affecting over 38 million people, and causing
over 1 million deaths. In this article, I analysed several time series
forecasting methods to predict the spread of COVID-19 second wave in Italy,
over the period after October 13, 2020. I used an autoregressive model (ARIMA),
an exponential smoothing state space model (ETS), a neural network
autoregression model (NNAR), and the following hybrid combinations of them:
ARIMA-ETS, ARIMA-NNAR, ETS-NNAR, and ARIMA-ETS-NNAR. About the data, I
forecasted the number of patients hospitalized with mild symptoms, and in
intensive care units (ICU). The data refer to the period February 21,
2020-October 13, 2020 and are extracted from the website of the Italian
Ministry of Health (www.salute.gov.it). The results show that i) the hybrid
models, except for ARIMA-ETS, are better at capturing the linear and non-linear
epidemic patterns, by outperforming the respective single models; and ii) the
number of COVID-19-related hospitalized with mild symptoms and in ICU will
rapidly increase in the next weeks, by reaching the peak in about 50-60 days,
i.e. in mid-December 2020, at least. To tackle the upcoming COVID-19 second
wave, on one hand, it is necessary to hire healthcare workers and implement
sufficient hospital facilities, protective equipment, and ordinary and
intensive care beds; and on the other hand, it may be useful to enhance social
distancing by improving public transport and adopting the double-shifts
schooling system, for example.

  We quantify user exposure to this content on various parts of the platform

YouTube suggests more pseudoscientific content regarding traditional
pseudoscientific topics (e.g., flat earth, anti-vaccination) than for emerging
ones (like COVID-19). At the same time, these recommendations are more common
on the search results page than on a user's homepage or when actively watching

contact tracing in many countries and resulting in widespread lockdowns for
emergency containment. Large-scale digital contact tracing (DCT) has emerged as
a potential solution to resume economic and social activity while minimizing
spread of the virus. Various DCT methods have been proposed, each making
trade-offs between privacy, mobility restrictions, and public health. The most
common approach, binary contact tracing (BCT), models infection as a binary
event, informed only by an individual's test results, with corresponding binary
recommendations that either all or none of the individual's contacts
quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection
process, which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals, and
prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings. It also does not make use of
observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical conditions, which could
be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions. In this paper, we use
a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator to develop and test
methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and proactively predict
an individual's infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based on their
contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy
constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to
the individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the
individual's contacts, who use this information to better predict their own
infectiousness, an approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). We find a
deep-learning based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average
mobility, suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave
prevention.

mobility. Finally, we design an interactive tool that showcases mobility
patterns in different granularities that can potentially help people and
government officials understand the mobility of individuals and the number of
COVID cases in a particular neighborhood. Our analysis, inferences, and
interactive showcasing of mobility patterns based on large-scale data can be
extrapolated to other cities of the world and has the potential to help in
designing more effective pandemic management measures in the future.

  and Speaker Satisfaction","The (COVID-19) pandemic-induced restrictions on travel and social gatherings
have prompted most conference organizers to move their events online. However,
in contrast to physical conferences, virtual conferences face a challenge in
efficiently scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants
from different time-zones as well as their interests in attending different
talks. In such settings, a natural objective for the conference organizers
would be to maximize some global welfare measure, such as the total expected
audience participation across all talks. However, we show that optimizing for
global welfare could result in a schedule that is unfair to the stakeholders,
i.e., the individual utilities for participants and speakers can be highly
unequal. To address the fairness concerns, we formally define fairness notions
for participants and speakers, and subsequently derive suitable fairness
objectives for them. We show that the welfare and fairness objectives can be in
conflict with each other, and there is a need to maintain a balance between
these objective while caring for them simultaneously. Thus, we propose a joint
optimization framework that allows conference organizers to design talk
schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) between global welfare,
participant fairness and the speaker fairness objectives. We show that the
optimization problem can be solved using integer linear programming, and
empirically evaluate the necessity and benefits of such joint optimization
approach in virtual conference scheduling.

  Epidemiological and Social Media Data","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced public health experts to develop contingent
policies to stem the spread of infection, including measures such as
partial/complete lockdowns. The effectiveness of these policies has varied with
geography, population distribution, and effectiveness in implementation.
Consequently, some nations (e.g., Taiwan, Haiti) have been more successful than
others (e.g., United States) in curbing the outbreak. A data-driven
investigation into effective public health policies of a country would allow
public health experts in other nations to decide future courses of action to
control the outbreaks of disease and epidemics. We chose Spain and India to
present our analysis on regions that were similar in terms of certain factors:
(1) population density, (2) unemployment rate, (3) tourism, and (4) quality of
living. We posit that citizen ideology obtainable from twitter conversations
can provide insights into conformity to policy and suitably reflect on future
case predictions. A milestone when the curves show the number of new cases
diverging from each other is used to define a time period to extract
policy-related tweets while the concepts from a causality network of
policy-dependent sub-events are used to generate concept clouds. The number of
new cases is predicted using sentiment scores in a regression model. We see
that the new case predictions reflects twitter sentiment, meaningfully tied to
a trigger sub-event that enables policy-related findings for Spain and India to
be effectively compared.

be easily modified to consider some lockdown measure, and we deduce that this
procedure drastically reduces the asymptotic value of infected individuals, as
expected, and observed in real life.

of the blockchain technology behind them. Differences between cryptocurrencies
and the exchanges on which they are traded have been shown. The central part
surveys the analysis of cryptocurrency price changes on various platforms. The
statistical properties of the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market have
been compared to the traditional markets. With the help of the latest
statistical physics methods the non-linear correlations and multiscale
characteristics of the cryptocurrency market are analyzed. In the last part the
co-evolution of the correlation structure among the 100 cryptocurrencies having
the largest capitalization is retraced. The detailed topology of cryptocurrency
network on the Binance platform from bitcoin perspective is also considered.
Finally, an interesting observation on the Covid-19 pandemic impact on the
cryptocurrency market is presented and discussed: recently we have witnessed a
""phase transition"" of the cryptocurrencies from being a hedge opportunity for
the investors fleeing the traditional markets to become a part of the global
market that is substantially coupled to the traditional financial instruments
like the currencies, stocks, and commodities.
  The main contribution is an extensive demonstration that structural
self-organization in the cryptocurrency markets has caused the same to attain
complexity characteristics that are nearly indistinguishable from the Forex
market at the level of individual time-series. However, the cross-correlations
between the exchange rates on cryptocurrency platforms differ from it. The
cryptocurrency market is less synchronized and the information flows more
slowly, which results in more frequent arbitrage opportunities. The methodology
used in the review allows the latter to be detected, and lead-lag relationships
to be discovered.

decades. Since the United States as we know it today is undeniably bipartisan,
this phenomenon would not appear as a surprise to most. However, there are
triggers which can cause spikes in disagreements between Democrats and
Republicans at a higher rate than how the two parties have been growing apart
gradually over time. This study has analyzed the idea that national events
which generally are detrimental to all individuals can be one of those
triggers. By testing polarization before and after three events (Hurricane
Sandy [2012], N. Korea Missile Test Surge [2019], COVID-19 [2020]) using
Twitter data, we show that a measurable spike in polarization occurs between
the Democrat and Republican party. In order to measure polarization, sentiments
of Twitter users aligned to the Democrat and Republican parties are compared on
identical entities (events, people, locations, etc.). Using hundreds of
thousands of data samples, a 2.8% increase in polarization was measured during
times of crisis compared to times where no crises were occurring. Regardless of
the reasoning that the gap between political parties can increase so much
during times of suffering and stress, it is definitely alarming to see that
among other aspects of life, the partisan gap worsens during detrimental
national events.

societal impact of COVID-19 in the United States during the early days of the
pandemic. With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people
to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of
schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We
methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related
hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories,
namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures,
5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope}, and study the temporal evolution of
tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to
all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief
concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets
as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our
investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and
negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying.
We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the
action words and then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze
the context of action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as
anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic
modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag
groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping
similar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to
construct an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays
the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.

  Disease Identification from Chest CT Scans using Capsule Networks","The global outbreak of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) disease has
drastically impacted the world and led to one of the most challenging crisis
across the globe since World War II. The early diagnosis and isolation of
COVID-19 positive cases are considered as crucial steps towards preventing the
spread of the disease and flattening the epidemic curve. Chest Computed
Tomography (CT) scan is a highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic
technique that can complement Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have shown promising diagnostic results.
CNNs, however, are incapable of capturing spatial relations between image
instances and require large datasets. Capsule Networks, on the other hand, can
capture spatial relations, require smaller datasets, and have considerably
fewer parameters. In this paper, a Capsule network framework, referred to as
the ""CT-CAPS"", is presented to automatically extract distinctive features of
chest CT scans. These features, which are extracted from the layer before the
final capsule layer, are then leveraged to differentiate COVID-19 from
Non-COVID cases. The experiments on our in-house dataset of 307 patients show

examine the distribution of coronaviruses among bats. We analyse the
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in a nine-week period following lockdown in Italy,
Spain, and Australia. We correlate its incidence with environmental variables
particularly ultraviolet radiation, temperature, and humidity. We establish a
clear negative relationship between COVID-19 and ultraviolet radiation,
modulated by temperature and humidity. We relate our results with data showing
that the bat species most vulnerable to coronavirus infection are those which
live in environmental conditions that are similar to those that appear to be
most favourable to the spread of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 ecological niche has
been the product of long-term coevolution of coronaviruses with their host
species. Understanding the key parameters of that niche in host species allows
us to predict circumstances where its spread will be most favourable. Such
conditions can be summarised under the headings of nocturnality and
seasonality. High ultraviolet radiation, in particular, is proposed as a key
limiting variable. We therefore expect the risk of spread of COVID-19 to be
highest in winter conditions, and in low light environments. Human activities
resembling those of highly social cave-dwelling bats (e.g. large nocturnal
gatherings or high density indoor activities) will only serve to compound the
problem of COVID-19.

targeting the nasopharynx, which has been shown to be the dominant preliminary
infection site for SARS-CoV-2. Although intranasal drugs can be administered
easily through drops or sprays, it is difficult to test whether current
protocols will deliver the right amount of the drug to this location
consistently. We are interested in developing an in silico prototyping tool to
rapidly identify optimal parameters for intranasal delivery. In this study, we
have applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate fluid flow through the
nasal cavity and examined particle deposition for a drug formulation, mimicking
different delivery methods. The nasal geometry models were derived using
digitized and meshed computed tomography (CT) scans of human patients. Using
the nasal geometries, we simulated two different airflows: a laminar model at
15 LPM (Liters/min) that simulated resting breathing rate and a Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) model used to achieve a higher flow rate of 30 LPM. We were
able to run particle tracking simulations for these two airflow schemes to test
different drug properties such as particle size. The different injection
methods used include surface injection which best replicates an inhaler-based
release of particle droplets into the nostril and the cone injection method
which best replicates a spray into the nostril. The results of the study
suggest that the most optimal drug particle size for targeting the intranasal
infection sites is around 6-14 microns.

information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information

(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the

than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.

caused widespread economic and social impact worldwide. Across the globe,
governments have put mandates for the use of face masks, which have received
both positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides an exciting
platform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing
patterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six
US cities. An increase in masks worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases
rose, particularly when their respective states imposed strict regulations. We
also found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws
were put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter
protest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore
masks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We
introduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety
MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks,
respectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector
(for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic
segmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector
achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model
for the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of
98%. We conclude that such a framework can be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of such public health strategies using social media platforms in
times of pandemic.

people had to switch to online media, such as social networks or

online games, combining entertainment with social interactions, also
experienced a notable growth. In our work, we focused on the potential of games
as a replacement for social contacts in the COVID-19 crisis. Our online survey
results indicate that the value of games for social needs depends on individual
gaming habits. Participants playing mostly multiplayer games increased their
playtime and mentioned social play as a key motivator. Contrarily, non-players
were not motivated to add games as communication channels. We deduce that such
crises mainly catalyze existing gaming habits.

  Corridors during COVID-19","Aspirations to slow down the spread of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) resulted
in unprecedented restrictions on personal and work-related travels in various
nations across the globe. As a consequence, economic activities within and
across the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities
start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes
critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing
pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the
commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by
combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment
with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the
proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and
across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many
SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing
the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health
vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks
due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while
the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's
districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the
overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into
choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political
decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states
while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to
transit-time related risks.

policies (treatments), such as opening of businesses, building of hospitals,
and sources of pollution, occur at specific spatial locations, with researchers
interested in their effects on nearby individuals or businesses (outcome
units). However, the existing treatment effects literature primarily considers
treatments that could be assigned directly at the level of the outcome units,
potentially with spillover effects. I approach the spatial treatment setting
from a similar experimental perspective: What ideal experiment would we design
to estimate the causal effects of spatial treatments? This perspective
motivates a comparison between individuals near realized treatment locations
and individuals near unrealized candidate locations, which is distinct from
current empirical practice. Furthermore, I show how to find such candidate
locations and apply the proposed methods with observational data. I apply the
proposed methods to study the causal effects of grocery stores on foot traffic
to nearby businesses during COVID-19 lockdowns.

  Hierarchical Convolutional Networks","The current COVID-19 pandemic has motivated the researchers to use artificial
intelligence techniques for a potential alternative to reverse

testing. The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast
diagnosis but the unavailability of large-scale annotated data makes the
clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection difficult.
Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not
extract reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we
propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to
naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the
first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from
well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the
convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations
relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding
multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition
performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of
achieving better results in comparison to the existing studies. The proposed
method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for
sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had already resulted in more
than thirty-two million cases infected and more than one million deaths
worldwide.
  Given the fact that the pandemic is still threatening health and safety, it
is in the urgency to understand the COVID-19 contagion process and know how it
might be controlled. With this motivation in mind, in this paper, we consider a
version of a stochastic discrete-time
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death~(SIRD)-based epidemiological model with
two uncertainties: The uncertain rate of infected cases which are undetected or
asymptomatic, and the uncertain effectiveness rate of control. Our aim is to
study the effect of an epidemic control policy on the uncertain model in a
control-theoretic framework. We begin by providing the closed-form solutions of
states in the modified SIRD-based model such as infected cases, susceptible
cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases. Then, the corresponding expected
states and the technical lower and upper bounds for those states are provided
as well. Subsequently, we consider two epidemic control problems to be
addressed: One is almost sure epidemic control problem and the other average
epidemic control problem. Having defined the two problems, our main results are
a set of sufficient conditions on a class of linear control policy which
assures that the epidemic is ""well-controlled""; i.e., both of the infected
cases and deceased cases are upper bounded uniformly and the number of infected
cases converges to zero asymptotically. Our numerical studies, using the
historical COVID-19 contagion data in the United States, suggest that our
appealingly simple model and control framework can provide a reasonable
epidemic control performance compared to the ongoing pandemic situation.

  Interhuman Airborne Pathogen Transmission","Pathogens such as viruses and bacteria play a vital role in human life, since
they cause infectious diseases which can lead to epidemics. Recent coronavirus
disease 2019 epidemic has shown that taking effective prevention measures such
as wearing masks are important to reduce the human deaths and side effects of
the epidemic. It is therefore requisite to accurately model the spread of
infectious diseases whose one of the most crucial routes of transmission is
airborne transmission. The transmission models in the literature are proposed
independently from each other, at different scales and by the researchers from
various disciplines. Thus, there is a need to merge all these research
attempts. To this end, we propose a communication engineering approach that
melts different disciplines such as epidemiology, biology, medicine, and fluid
dynamics in the same pot to model airborne pathogen transmission among humans.
In this approach, we introduce the concept of mobile human ad hoc networks
(MoHANETs). This concept exploits the similarity of airborne
transmission-driven human groups with mobile ad hoc networks and uses molecular
communication as the enabling paradigm. The aim of this article is to present a
unified framework using communication engineering, and to highlight future
research directions for modeling the spread of infectious diseases among humans
through airborne pathogen transmission. In this article, we first review the
airborne pathogen transmission mechanisms. Then, the MoHANET is given with a
layered structure. In these layers, the infectious human emitting
pathogen-laden droplets through air and the exposed human to these droplets are
considered as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Moreover, the
experimental methods for the proposed approach are reviewed and discussed.

Germany. Despite the trade-off between COVID-19 prevention and economic
activity that is inherent to shielding policies, our results show that
efficiency gains can be achieved by targeting such policies towards different

reduce the degree of targeting and the intensity and duration of shielding. Our

  Contact Networks","We present a general framework for adaptive allocation of viral tests in
social contact networks. We pose and solve several complementary problems.
First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the
early detection of a novel epidemic outbreak. In particular, we propose an
algorithm to select a subset of individuals to be tested in order to detect the
onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a
hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity
optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed
solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the
problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize
the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize
this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose
an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we
derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model
with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for
non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed
framework in numerical experiments involving a model of Covid-19 applied to a
real human contact network.

the fourth largest number of cases and the largest number of deaths among all
the cities in India (as of 28th October 2020). Along with the rest of India,
lockdowns (of varying degrees) have been in effect in Mumbai since March 25,
2020. Given the large economic toll on the country from the lockdown and the
related restrictions on mobility of people and goods, swift opening of the
economy especially in a financial hub such as Mumbai becomes critical. In this
report, we use the IISc-TIFR agent based simulator to develop long term
projections for Mumbai under realistic scenarios related to Mumbai's opening of
the workplaces, or equivalently, the economy, and the associated public
transportation through local trains and buses. These projections were developed
taking into account a possible second wave if the economy and the local trains
are fully opened either on November 1, 2020 or on January 1, 2021. The impact
on infection spread in Mumbai if the schools and colleges open on January first

is manageable provided reasonable medical infrastructure is in place. Further,
schools and colleges opening in January do not lead to excessive increase in
infections.

facial images and cues are then processed by a neoteric classifier that
utilises the MobileNetV2 architecture as an object detector for identifying
masked regions. The proposed framework was tested on a dataset which is a
collection of videos capturing the movement of people in public spaces while
complying with COVID-19 safety protocols. The proposed methodology demonstrated
its effectiveness in detecting facial masks by achieving high precision,
recall, and accuracy.

over the world. As one of the efficient solutions, mechanical
harvest/auto-harvest that is based on object detection and robotic harvester
becomes an urgent need. Within the auto-harvest system, robust few-shot object
detection model is one of the bottlenecks, since the system is required to deal
with new vegetable/fruit categories and the collection of large-scale annotated

object detection models that were developed by the community. Yet whether they
could be employed directly for real life agricultural applications is still
questionable, as there is a context-gap between the commonly used training
datasets and the images collected in real life agricultural scenarios. To this
end, in this study, we present a novel cucumber dataset and propose two data
augmentation strategies that help to bridge the context-gap. Experimental

  Prevention Strategies","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 spreading, the number of studies on the
epidemic models increased dramatically. It is important for policy makers to
know how the disease will spread, and what are the effects of the policies and
environment on the spreading. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the
standard infectious disease models: (a) We consider the prevention measures
adopted based on the current severity of the infection, those measures are
adaptive and change over time. (b) Multiple cities and regions are considered,
with population movements between those cities/regions, while taking into
account that each region may have different prevention measures. While the
adaptive measures and mobility of the population were often observed during the
pandemic, these effects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the
classical epidemic models. The model we propose gives rise to a plateau
phenomenon: the number of people infected by the disease stay at the same level
during an extended period of time. We show what are conditions needs to be met
in order for the spreading to exhibit a plateau period, and we show that this
phenomenon is interdependent: when considering multiples cities, the conditions
are different from a single city. We verify from the real-world data that
plateau phenomenon does exists in many regions of the world in the current
COVID-19 development. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis on the plateau
phenomenon for the single-city model, and derive a series of results on the
emergence and ending of the plateau, and on the height and length of the
plateau. Our theoretical results match well with our empirical findings.

life and unprecedented economical loss throughout the world. Social distancing
and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect
others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and
sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we
carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of
unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of
saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks.
Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow
(indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect
of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical
grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging
from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva
particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with
medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus,
in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can
successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under
outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow
through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the
energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large
distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial
masks.

  COVID-19 Outbreak","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive number of attempts on the predictions
of the number of cases and the other future trends of this pandemic have been
made. However, they fail to predict, in a reliable way, the medium and long
term evolution of fundamental features of COVID-19 outbreak within acceptable
accuracy. This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning
models in this particular forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple
linear regression models provide high prediction accuracy values reliably but
only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models,
which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors,
cannot achieve to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization
ability. It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient number of
samples is the source of low prediction performance of the forecasting models.
The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured
in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as
expectations for the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the
information, which is of most relevant with the active cases, we perform
feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different feature
selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature
Selection, and feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them
to each other and also with the models not employing any feature selection.
Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and
Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases
together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that
the accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization ability
is possible up to 3 days only because of the small sample size of COVID-19

this sense. Spatio-temporal models provide a geographically detailed and
temporally updated overview of the current state of the pandemics, making
public health interventions to be more effective. Moreover, the use of
spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context,
facilitates estimating newly demanded epidemiological indicators, such as the

allows to adapt traditional disease mapping models to these new circumstancies

MnasNet, MobileNet, DenseNet, SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, GoogleNet, ResNet,
ResNeXt, VGG and a simple CNN with and without transfer learning. We find the
mobile network, EfficientNet (with transfer learning) achieves the best mean
performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

functional AI model to triage by inferencing using a single x-ray image, while
the deep-learning model is trained using both X-ray and CT data. We report on
how such a multi-modal training improves the solution compared to X-ray only
training. The multi-modal solution increases the AUC (area under the receiver

the Dice coefficient (0.59 to 0.62) for localizing the pathology. To the best

  Support Vector Machines","Purpose: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which emerged in Wuhan, China and
affected the whole world, has cost the lives of thousands of people. Manual
diagnosis is inefficient due to the rapid spread of this virus. For this
reason, automatic COVID-19 detection studies are carried out with the support
of artificial intelligence algorithms. Methods: In this study, a deep learning
model that detects COVID-19 cases with high performance is presented. The
proposed method is defined as Convolutional Support Vector Machine (CSVM) and
can automatically classify Computed Tomography (CT) images. Unlike the
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained with the transfer
learning method, the CSVM model is trained as a scratch. To evaluate the
performance of the CSVM method, the dataset is divided into two parts as
training (%75) and testing (%25). The CSVM model consists of blocks containing
three different numbers of SVM kernels. Results: When the performance of
pre-trained CNN networks and CSVM models is assessed, CSVM (7x7, 3x3, 1x1)
model shows the highest performance with 94.03% ACC, 96.09% SEN, 92.01% SPE,
92.19% PRE, 94.10% F1-Score, 88.15% MCC and 88.07% Kappa metric values.
Conclusion: The proposed method is more effective than other methods. It has
proven in experiments performed to be an inspiration for combating COVID and
for future studies.

the implementation of targeted countermeasures, based on quantitative and
multi-scale elements, for the fight and prevention of emergencies, such as the
current COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is a centralized system (web application),
single multi-user platform, which relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms for the processing of heterogeneous data, and which can produce an
output level of risk. The model includes a specific neural network which will
be first trained to learn the correlation between selected inputs, related to
the case of interest: environmental variables (chemical-physical, such as
meteorological), human activity (such as traffic and crowding), level of
pollution (in particular the concentration of particulate matter), and
epidemiological variables related to the evolution of the contagion. The tool
realized in the first phase of the project will serve later both as a decision
support system (DSS) with predictive capacity, when fed by the actual measured
data, and as a simulation bench performing the tuning of certain input values,
to identify which of them lead to a decrease in the degree of risk. In this
way, the authors aim to design different scenarios to compare different
restrictive strategies and the actual expected benefits, to adopt measures
sized to the actual need, and adapted to the specific areas of analysis, useful
to safeguard human health, but also the economic and social impact of the
choices.

  COVID-19 lockdown in Delhi","The Government of India (GOI) announced a nationwide lockdown starting 25th
March 2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented
decline in anthropogenic activities and in turn improvements in ambient air
quality. This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical
speciation and source apportionment of PM$_{2.5}$ to assess the impact of the
lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ in
Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM$_{2.5}$
were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report
source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of
organic and elemental fractions of PM$_{2.5}$ during the different phases of
the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal
combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to
decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as
compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O$_3$ concentrations with
declining NO$_x$ levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe,
leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to
almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the
lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other
resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related,
hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions,
which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the
four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for
future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which
constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air.

However,
pandemics like covid-19 require deep learning capabilities at mobile devices
(detect respiratory rate using mobile robotics or conduct CT scan using a
mobile scanner), which are severely constrained by the limited storage and
computation resources at the device level. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-tier architecture, including robot layers, edge layers, and cloud layers.
We adopt this architecture to design a non-contact respiratory monitoring
system to break down respiratory rate calculation tasks. Experimental results
of respiratory rate monitoring show that the proposed approach in this paper
significantly outperforms other approaches. It is supported by computation time
costs with 2.26 ms per frame, 27.48 ms per frame, 0.78 seconds for convolution
operation, similarity calculation, processing one-minute length respiratory
signals, respectively. And the computation time costs of our three-tier
architecture are less than that of edge+cloud architecture and cloud
architecture. Moreover, we use our three-tire architecture for CT image
diagnosis task decomposition. The evaluation of a CT image dataset of COVID-19
proves that our three-tire architecture is useful for resolving tasks on deep
learning networks by edge equipment. There are broad application scenarios in
smart hospitals in the future.

  COVID-19 Data-sets","The Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is an infectious pulmonary disorder, has
affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the
WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of
causing severe conditions in the patients, the development of rapid and
accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse
transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence
of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples. But, RT-PCR
suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore,
the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of
COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage
exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for
X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be used
by radiologists as a supporting tool in COVID-19 detection, has been proposed.
Deep feature sets extracted by using CNNs were concatenated for feature level
fusion and fed to multiple classifiers in terms of decision level fusion idea
with the aim of discriminating COVID-19, pneumonia and no-finding classes. In
the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the
resultant decisions of classifiers. The obtained accuracy values and confusion
matrix based evaluation criteria were presented for three progressively created
data-sets. The aspects of the proposed method that are superior to existing
COVID-19 detection studies have been discussed and the fusion performance of
proposed approach was validated visually by using Class Activation Mapping
technique. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has
attained high COVID-19 detection performance that was proven by its comparable
accuracy and superior precision/recall values with the existing studies.

efforts are focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved

Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell
responses to viral infection and have been studied in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV;
however, such changes are not fully described for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we
analyzed multiple transcriptomes obtained from cell lines infected with

Using integrative analyses of gene co-expression networks and de-novo pathway
enrichment, we characterize different gene modules and protein pathways
enriched with Transcription Factors or Epifactors relevant for SARS-CoV-2
infection. We identified EP300, MOV10, RELA and TRIM25 as top candidates, and
more than 60 additional proteins involved in the epigenetic response during

question, we compare the actual data to a hypothetical case in which the
mitigation measures are left intact using a projection of the data from before
mitigation measures were eased. We find that different states have shown
significant differences in the number of deaths, possibly due to their
different policies and reopening schedules. Our study provides a gauge for the
effectiveness of the approaches by different state governments and can serve as
a guide for implementing best policies in the future. It also indicates that
the face mask mandate seems to correlate with the change in the death count

constant airflow is maintained via fans. A minimum air flow rate of $\sim20-30$

We validated that using easily available PTFE wrap, a factor of $\sim 18$

analysis is presented for the air travel time distributions through the
cavities, and the expectation value for actual pathogen elimination is
computed. We provide the scaling of pathogen elimination with the number of
cavities in series, reflective enhancement, UV source power, sphere radius and
airflow rate. We show that disinfection greater than 4-log is achievable for a
series of three or more spheres. We 3D printed our prototype, consisting of two
spheres of 10 cm diameter each in series for each direction of disinfection.
Using UVC LEDs emitting $\sim$ 40 mW of power each with an airflow rate of 30
L/min, actual SARS-COV2 virus elimination of $\sim$ 98% is expected. While not
manually feasible to construct smaller spheres in the lab, smaller cavities can
be commercially manufactured, leading to significantly higher actual pathogen

Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by

merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be
ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to

The automatic segmentation of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) has
become an effective method for diagnosis. In order to realize the full
potential of deep learning models in COVID-19 pneumonia infections
segmentation, a great deal of annotated CT data is needed for training. The
data is difficult to collect due to the high risk of infection, and it is
laborious to annotate. Recent advances in image synthesis make it possible to
train deep learning models on realistic synthetic data with computer-generated

greatly improving the representation ability of the segmentation network. The

widespread and unexpected social and economic change. These changes can force
workers to transition to new jobs. This may be because technologies emerge or
production is moved abroad. Perhaps it is a global crisis, such as COVID-19,
which shutters industries and displaces labor en masse. Regardless of the
impetus, people are faced with the challenge of moving between jobs to find new
work. Successful transitions typically occur when workers leverage their
existing skills in the new occupation. Here, we propose a novel method to
measure the similarity between occupations using their underlying skills. We
then build a recommender system for identifying optimal transition pathways
between occupations using job advertisements (ads) data and a longitudinal

the other). We also build an early warning indicator for new technology
adoption (showcasing Artificial Intelligence), a major driver of rising job
transitions. By using real-time data, our systems can respond to labor demand
shifts as they occur (such as those caused by COVID-19), and can be leveraged
by policy-makers, educators, and jobseekers who are forced to confront the
often distressing challenges of having to find new jobs.

  between Income Groups","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments
have encouraged and ordered citizens to practice social distancing,
particularly by working and studying at home. Intuitively, only a subset of
people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little
research on the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups
in US cities during the pandemic. The authors worked to fill this gap by
quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater
Houston, Texas. In this study, we determined human mobility using
pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal
study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total
travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip
distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent
disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular,
there was a strong negative correlation ($\rho$ = -0.90) between a traveler's
estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility
adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets
experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of
distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The
findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the
mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The
study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and
researchers alike in the wake of an epidemic.

pandemic cities in motion. Ride-pooling, where a single vehicle is shared by
more than one traveller, is not only appealing for mobility platforms and their
travellers, but also for promoting the sustainability of urban mobility

effective alternative given the personal and public health risks considerations
associated with the COVID-19 pandemic is hitherto unknown. To answer this, we
combine epidemiological and behavioural shareability models to examine
spreading among ride-pooling travellers, with an application for Amsterdam.
Findings are at first sight devastating, with only few initially infected
travellers needed to spread the virus to hundreds of ride-pooling users.
Without intervention, ride-pooling system may substantially contribute to virus
spreading. Notwithstanding, we identify an effective control measure allowing
to halt the spreading before the outbreaks (at 50 instead of 800 infections).
Fixed matches among co-travellers disconnect the otherwise dense contact
network, encapsulating the virus in small communities and preventing the
outbreaks.

In this article, we integrate different aspects of resource allocation and seek
a synergistic intervention strategy that gives vulnerable populations with

strategy is a trade-off between geographical coverage and social group
fairness. The proposed principle can be applied to other scarce resources and

  COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Distribution","The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains,
as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections.
Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain
publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting
modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that
models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on
individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy
necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency
settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain
resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely
qualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further,
publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific
supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as
transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine
production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major
gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of
real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We
conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that
encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical
networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale
COVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic
underscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a
multi-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into
analysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover,
adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.

  Features","The application of computer vision for COVID-19 diagnosis is complex and
challenging, given the risks associated with patient misclassifications.
Arguably, the primary value of medical imaging for COVID-19 lies rather on
patient prognosis. Radiological images can guide physicians assessing the
severity of the disease, and a series of images from the same patient at
different stages can help to gauge disease progression. Hence, a simple method
based on lung-pathology interpretable features for scoring disease severity
from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution, this method
correlates well to patient severity in different stages of disease progression
with competitive results compared to other existing, more complex methods. An
original data selection approach is also proposed, allowing the simple model to
learn the severity-related features. It is hypothesized that the resulting
competitive performance presented here is related to the method being
feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or opacity as others in
the literature. A second contribution comes from the validation of the results,
conceptualized as the scoring of patients groups from different stages of the
disease. Besides performing such validation on an independent data set, the
results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the
literature. The results show that there is a significant correlation between
the scoring system (MAVIDH) and patient outcome, which could potentially help
physicians rating and following disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

Zika virus, Ebola virus, MERS-coronavirus etc. Though conventional techniques
have succeeded in detecting these viruses to some extent, these techniques are
time-consuming, costly, and require trained human-resources. Plasmonic
metamaterial-based biosensors might pave the way to low-cost rapid virus
detection. So this review discusses in details the latest development in
plasmonics and metamaterial-based biosensors for virus, viral particles and

Free-text clinical notes contain critical information for resolving these

use this text-encoded information in large-scale studies. This work presents a
new clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT)

COVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a
span-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated
phenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom
events with associated assertion values (0.83-0.97 F1 for events and 0.73-0.79
F1 for assertions). In a secondary use application, we explored the prediction
of COVID-19 test results using structured patient data (e.g. vital signs and
laboratory results) and automatically extracted symptom information. The
automatically extracted symptoms improve prediction performance, beyond

diagnostic testing for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, contact
tracing, quarantine of individuals with symptoms or who are exposed to
COVID-19, and maintaining strict hygiene standards at the individual and
community level. Digital technology, currently being used for COVID-19 testing
include certain mobile apps, web dashboards, and online self-assessment tools.
Herein, we look into various digital solutions adapted by communities across
universities, businesses, and other organizations. We summarize the challenges
experienced using these tools in terms of quality of information, privacy, and
user-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and being
developed, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of both
quality and quantity, which can be overwhelming to the users. Understanding the
testing landscape through a digital lens will give a clear insight into the
multiple challenges that we face including data privacy, cost, and
miscommunication. It is the destiny of digitalization to navigate testing for
COVID-19. Block-chain based systems can be used for privacy preservation and

involves having digital health passports with relevant and correct information.

statistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functions
and the probability density function, have duly been computed. Our models,
which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a specialised
journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the
crucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish this
work we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious
=> Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-model
integrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown
measures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown
measures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in the
second scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, the
Coronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to
diminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with
the action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen
the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during a period
of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number of
vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, we
analysed the data for USA and France where the intensities of the noise have
been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular, for USA we have
analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave of
infection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2
infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions and real data confirms
the validity of our approach.

were less engaging than facts; (iii) the textual content of a tweet was the
most important to distinguish fact from misinformation while (iv) user account
metadata and human-like activity were most important to predict high engagement

adopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000
rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) to
capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying
them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We
aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major
changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to
the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the
pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using
multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital,
income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of
personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level
pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and
causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically
disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential
COVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the people
who have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conducting
counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about
the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines
for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine
acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based

from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared
spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between

  Empirical findings from Nanjing, China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered a worldwide outbreak of
pandemic, and transportation services have played a key role in coronavirus
transmission. Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro
car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the bike surface and take the
transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and
avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on
the trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel
demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the
perspective of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic
difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes
are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike
sharing during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies
sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly.
Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and
older adults are more dependent on bike sharing systems. Besides, the trip
decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a new concept of
user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes.
This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19
pandemic, and also inspires the blocking of viral transmission within the city.

urbanization with the steep population growth, modern cities also facing
substantial challenges. Hence, usage of technology is anticipated to be the
precondition for adaptive, resilient, and sustainable development, where, a
smart city is defined as the accumulated advanced ideas of information and
technology aiming to ensure a decent quality of life for the inhabitants.

Bangladesh will exceed 180 million in 2026. It is also speculated that Dhaka
being the capital will be populated with 14 million inhabitants. Moreover,
Dhaka has already been labeled as the most densely populated city in the world.
Thus, concerned authorities are facing enormous challenges to provide and

need of the hour to conceptualize an information and communication
technology-driven smart city for Bangladesh. A smart city may contain numerous
components; however, the proposed framework identifies seven components and
services for smart cities in Bangladesh. These are healthcare, education,
transportation, public safety, real estate, utilities, and city administration.

  and its Clinical Applications in COVID-19","In recent years, deep learning-based image analysis methods have been widely
applied in computer-aided detection, diagnosis and prognosis, and has shown its
value during the public health crisis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in
COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the
United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image
retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated
clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image
diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model
based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims
at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims
at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same
labels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity
loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the
optimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The
model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset
collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image
retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a
robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model
is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support
task, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a
new dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep
metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR
retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the
treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.

  calculations","In recent years, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has triggered a
lot of activity in the lattice QCD community because a persistent tension of
about $3.5~\sigma$ is observed between the phenomenological estimate and the
Brookhaven measurement. The current best phenomenological estimate has an
uncertainty comparable to the experimental one and the error is completely
dominated by hadronic effects: the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization
(HVP) contribution and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering
contribution. Both are accessible via lattice simulations and a reduction of
the error by a factor 4 is required in view of the forthcoming experiments at
Fermilab and J-PARC whose results, expected in the next few years, should
reduce the experimental precision down to the level of $0.14~$ppm. In this
article, I review the status of lattice calculations of those quantities,
starting with the HVP. This contribution has now reached sub-percent precision
and requires a careful understanding of all sources of systematic errors. The
HLbL contribution, that is much smaller, still contributes significantly to the
error. This contribution is more challenging to compute, but rapid progress has
been made on the lattice in the last few years.

large population across the world and continues with its devastating
consequences. It is imperative to detect COVID-19 at the earliest to limit the
span of infection. In this work, a new classification technique CB-STM-RENet
based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Channel Boosting is
proposed for the screening of COVID-19 in chest X-Rays. In this connection, to
learn the COVID-19 specific radiographic patterns, a new convolution block
based on split-transform-merge (STM) is developed. This new block
systematically incorporates region and edge-based operations at each branch to
capture the diverse set of features at various levels, especially those related
to region homogeneity, textural variations, and boundaries of the infected
region. The learning and discrimination capability of the proposed CNN
architecture is enhanced by exploiting the Channel Boosting idea that
concatenates the auxiliary channels along with the original channels. The
auxiliary channels are generated from the pre-trained CNNs using Transfer
Learning. The effectiveness of the proposed technique CB-STM-RENet is evaluated
on three different datasets of chest X-Rays namely CoV-Healthy-6k,
CoV-NonCoV-10k, and CoV-NonCoV-15k. The performance comparison of the proposed
CB-STM-RENet with the existing techniques exhibits high performance both in
discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from Healthy, as well as, other types
of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all these
three datasets; especially on the stringent CoV-NonCoV-15k dataset. The good
detection rate (97%), and high precision (93%) of the proposed technique
suggest that it can be adapted for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients.

Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework, as a decentralised and more privacy

notification mostly at the operating system layer, instead of fully at the
app(lication) layer. In this paper we study the consequences of this approach.
We argue that this creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance at the
operating system layer. We show how it does not technically prevent the health
authorities from implementing a purely centralised form of contact tracing
(even though that is the stated aim). We highlight that GAEN allows Google and
Apple to dictate how contact tracing is (or rather isn't) implemented in

creep.

stated that this virus is usually transmitted by droplets caused by sneezing or

detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)
tests with the help of a swab taken from the nose or throat. In addition, X-ray

graphene enhanced the sensing ability to a peerless level. Amongst different
graphene-based biosensing schemes, graphene field-effect transistor marked its
unique presence owing to its ability of ultrasensitive and low-noise detection
thereby facilitating instantaneous measurements even in the presence of small
amounts of analytes. Recently, graphene field-effect transistor type biosensor
is even successfully employed in rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 and this
triggers the interest of the scientific community in reviewing the current
developments in graphene field-effect transistor. Subsequently, in this
article, the recent progress in graphene field-effect transistor type
biosensors for the detection of the virus is reviewed and challenges along with
their strengths are discussed.

  systematic review","OBJECTIVES: Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 vary
across countries. This paper aims to characterise the spatial variability in R0
across the first six months of the global COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore
social factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.
  METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from
January to June 2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that
provided R0 estimates. For each study, the value of the estimate, country under
study and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value was calculated
per country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each
country with an R0 estimate, the Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable
Mobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and development status
were obtained from external sources.
  RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies
provided at least one estimate of R0, along with sufficient methodology to
explain how the value was calculated. Values of R0 ranged between 0.48 and
14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.
  CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the
estimates of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights
the spatial heterogeneity in R0. Higher values were recorded in more developed
countries, and countries with an older population or more sustainable mobility.
Countries with higher population density had lower R0 estimates. For most
regions, variability in R0 spiked initially before reducing and stabilising as
more estimates became available.

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few
annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised
learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the
generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently
incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be
sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each
anatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach
with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on
the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph
neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical
regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences
between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph
representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in
full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets
of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods
that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify
the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well
to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals. Qualitative results suggest that
our model can identify clinically relevant regions in the images.

control problem to understand the roles of treatment in controlling the
epidemic. From the Stability analysis we see that the infection free
equilibrium remains asymptotically stable whenever $R_0 < 1$ and as $R_0$
crosses unity we have the infected equilibrium to be stable. From the
sensitivity analysis parameters $u_{11}$, $b_1$, $\beta_1$, $d_1$ and $\mu$

that the infection among the adult population(age $\geq 30)$ is least
considering the second control $u_{12}$ whereas, when both the controls
$u_{11}$ and $u_{12}$ are considered together the infectives is minimum in case
of young populations(age $ \leq 30$). The cumulative infected population
reduced the maximum when the second control was considered followed by
considering both the controls together. The control $u_{12}$ was effective for
mild epidemic $(R_0 \in(1, 2))$ whereas control $u_{11}$ was found to be highly
effective when epidemic was severe $(R_0 \in(2, 7))$ for the population of age

  Resolution Real-World Mobility Data","As countries look towards re-opening of economic activities amidst the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While
contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path
to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate
the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores
either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume
uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on
reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics.
Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign
relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging
high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals.
While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an
individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary
mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore,
we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility
behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via
simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain
spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide
useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.

March 2020 by the World Health Organization. It consists of an emerging viral
infection with respiratory tropism that could develop atypical pneumonia.
Experts emphasize the importance of early detection of those who have the
COVID-19 virus. In this way, patients will be isolated from other people and
the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an
area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a
rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the
standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone,
alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this
study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning
(DL) algorithms, which have been popular in recent years, have been
comprehensively discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of different
approaches used in literature are examined in detail. The Computed Tomography
of the chest and X-ray images give a rich representation of the patient's lung
that is less time-consuming and allows an efficient viral pneumonia detection
using the DL algorithms. The first step is the pre-processing of these images
to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep
models (pre-trained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.).
Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide
whether the patient is infected by coronavirus or it is another lung disease.
In this study, we also give a brief review of the latest applications of cough
analysis to early screen the COVID-19, and human mobility estimation to limit

renewed focus on the resulting threat to public health. Given this increased
visibility, in-depth analysis of COVID-19 misinformation spread is critical to
understanding the evolution of ideas with potential negative public health
impact.
  Methods: Using a curated data set of COVID-19 tweets (N ~120 million tweets)
spanning late January to early May 2020, we applied methods including regular
expression filtering, supervised machine learning, sentiment analysis,
geospatial analysis, and dynamic topic modeling to trace the spread of
misinformation and to characterize novel features of COVID-19 conspiracy
theories.
  Results: Random forest models for four major misinformation topics provided
mixed results, with narrowly-defined conspiracy theories achieving F1 scores of
0.804 and 0.857, while more broad theories performed measurably worse, with
scores of 0.654 and 0.347. Despite this, analysis using model-labeled data was
beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation
indicators. We were able to identify distinct increases in negative sentiment,
theory-specific trends in geospatial spread, and the evolution of conspiracy
theory topics and subtopics over time.
  Conclusions: COVID-19 related conspiracy theories show that history
frequently repeats itself, with the same conspiracy theories being recycled for
new situations. We use a combination of supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and natural language processing techniques to look at the evolution
of theories over the first four months of the COVID-19 outbreak, how these
theories intertwine, and to hypothesize on more effective public health
messaging to combat misinformation in online spaces.

model is based on a combination of three lightweight pre-trained models
SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet-B0 at different depths, and combines
feature maps in different abstraction levels. In the proposed end to-end model,
networks are used as feature extractors in parallel after fine-tuning, and some

  from Chest X-rays","In this paper, our focus is on constructing models to assist a clinician in
the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in situations where it is easier and cheaper
to obtain X-ray data than to obtain high-quality images like those from CT
scans. Deep neural networks have repeatedly been shown to be capable of
constructing highly predictive models for disease detection directly from image
data. However, their use in assisting clinicians has repeatedly hit a stumbling
block due to their black-box nature. Some of this difficulty can be alleviated
if predictions were accompanied by explanations expressed in clinically
relevant terms. In this paper, deep neural networks are used to extract
domain-specific features(morphological features like ground-glass opacity and
disease indications like pneumonia) directly from the image data. Predictions
about these features are then used to construct a symbolic model (a decision
tree) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays, accompanied with two
kinds of explanations: visual (saliency maps, derived from the neural stage),
and textual (logical descriptions, derived from the symbolic stage). A
radiologist rates the usefulness of the visual and textual explanations. Our
results demonstrate that neural models can be employed usefully in identifying
domain-specific features from low-level image data; that textual explanations
in terms of clinically relevant features may be useful; and that visual
explanations will need to be clinically meaningful to be useful.

  fact-checking content","The rise of social media has ignited an unprecedented circulation of false
information in our society. It is even more evident in times of crises, such as
the COVID-19 pandemic. Fact-checking efforts have expanded greatly and have
been touted as among the most promising solutions to fake news, especially in
times like these. Several studies have reported the development of
fact-checking organizations in Western societies, albeit little attention has
been given to the Global South. Here, to fill this gap, we introduce a novel
Markov-inspired computational method for identifying topics in tweets. In
contrast to other topic modeling approaches, our method clusters topics and
their current evolution in a predefined time window. Through these, we
collected data from Twitter accounts of two Brazilian fact-checking outlets and
presented the topics debunked by these initiatives in fortnights throughout the
pandemic. By comparing these organizations, we could identify similarities and
differences in what was shared by them. Our method resulted in an important
technique to cluster topics in a wide range of scenarios, including an
infodemic -- a period overabundance of the same information. In particular, the
data clearly revealed a complex intertwining between politics and the health
crisis during this period. We conclude by proposing a generic model which, in
our opinion, is suitable for topic modeling and an agenda for future research.

  Information","New binary classification tests are often evaluated relative to a
pre-established test. For example, rapid Antigen tests for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 are assessed relative to more established PCR tests. In this paper,
I argue that the new test can be described as producing ambiguous information
when the pre-established is imperfect. This allows for a phenomenon called
dilation -- an extreme form of non-informativeness. As an example, I present
hypothetical test data satisfying the WHO's minimum quality requirement for
rapid Antigen tests which leads to dilation. The ambiguity in the information
arises from a missing data problem due to imperfection of the established test:
the joint distribution of true infection and test results is not observed.
Using results from Copula theory, I construct the (usually non-singleton) set
of all these possible joint distributions, which allows me to assess the new
test's informativeness. This analysis leads to a simple sufficient condition to
make sure that a new test is not a dilation. I illustrate my approach with
applications to data from three COVID-19 related tests. Two rapid Antigen tests
satisfy my sufficient condition easily and are therefore informative. However,
less accurate procedures, like chest CT scans, may exhibit dilation.

  Pandemic","Background: Guidelines and recommendations from public health authorities
related to face masks have been essential in containing the COVID-19 pandemic.
We assessed the prevalence and correlates of mask usage during the pandemic.
  Methods: We examined a total of 13,723,810 responses to a daily
cross-sectional representative online survey in 38 countries who completed from
April 23, 2020 to October 31, 2020 and reported having been in public at least
once during the last seven days. The outcome was individual face mask usage in
public settings, and the predictors were country fixed effects, country-level
mask policy stringency, calendar time, individual sociodemographic factors, and
health prevention behaviors. Associations were modelled using survey-weighted
multivariable logistic regression.
  Findings: Mask-wearing varied over time and across the 38 countries. While
some countries consistently showed high prevalence throughout, in other
countries mask usage increased gradually, and a few other countries remained at
low prevalence. Controlling for time and country fixed effects,
sociodemographic factors (older age, female gender, education, urbanicity) and
stricter mask-related policies were significantly associated with higher mask
usage in public settings, while social behaviors considered risky in the
context of the pandemic (going out to large events, restaurants, shopping
centers, and socializing outside of the household) were associated with lower
mask use.
  Interpretation: The decision to wear a face mask in public settings is
significantly associated with sociodemographic factors, risky social behaviors,
and mask policies. This has important implications for health prevention
policies and messaging, including the potential need for more targeted policy
and messaging design.

mitigate the economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such
widespread adoption of social distancing measures is wholly unprecedented, and
governments have implemented a variety of policies to encourage compliance.
These typically rely on financial penalties (fines) and/or informational
messages (nudges). There is, however, a lack of evidence on the impact of these
policies. We examine the effectiveness of fines and nudges in promoting social
distancing in a web-based interactive experiment. The study involves a
nearrepresentative sample of 400 participants from the US population, and it
was conducted in May 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Fines significantly
promote distancing, but nudges only have a marginal impact. Political ideology
also has a causal impact -- progressives are more likely to practice
distancing, and are marginally more responsive to fines. Further, individuals
do more social distancing when they know they may be a superspreader. Our
results highlight the crucial role of web-based interactive experiments in
informing governments on the causal impact of policies at a time when lab
and/or field-based experimental research is not feasible.

still rampaging through the world. Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical
interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of
residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial
distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the
subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or
slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for
being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are
usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose
C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every
neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the
spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher
collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then
characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of
features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the
firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local
outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn
""city-invariant"" representations from the mobility-related features for precise
early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases
known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher
using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the
results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early
detection of high-risk neighborhoods from a large number of cities.

test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally,
only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and
recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track
the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size
increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates,
which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby
improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care
provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either
the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.

were recruited from Finnish patient and disabled people's organizations, other
health-related organizations and professionals, and educational institutions
(n=673). We analyzed rating differences and dependencies with Kendall
rank-correlation and cosine similarity measures and tests of Wilcoxon rank-sum,
Kruskal-Wallis and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between groups, and
carried out machine learning experiments with a basic implementation of a
convolutional neural network algorithm. We found statistically significant
correlations and high cosine similarity values between various health-related
expression statement pairs concerning the ""need for help"" ratings and a
background question pair. We also identified statistically significant rating
differences for several health-related expression statements in respect to
groupings based on the answer values of background questions, such as the
ratings of suspecting to have the coronavirus infection and having it depending
on the estimated health condition, quality of life and sex. Our experiments
with a convolutional neural network algorithm showed the applicability of
machine learning to support detecting the need for help in the patient's

  admission policy on COVID-19 mortalities","It is evident that increasing the intensive-care-unit (ICU) capacity and
giving priority to admitting and treating younger patients will reduce the
number of COVID-19 deaths, but a quantitative assessment of these measures has
remained inadequate. We develop a comprehensive, non-Markovian state transition
model, which is validated through accurate prediction of the daily death toll
for two epicenters: Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy. The model enables
prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment
priorities had been given to younger patients, the death toll in Wuhan and
Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4\% and 6.7\%, respectively. The
strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with
a younger population structure. Analyses of data from China, South Korea,
Italy, and Spain suggest that countries with less per capita ICU medical
resources should implement this strategy in the early stage of the pandemic to
reduce mortalities.

  Applications","The novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly and abruptly changed the
world as we knew in 2020. It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic
epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its
high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important
to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and
be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an
important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of
medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in
a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation
of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can
assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis,
severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients.
In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state,
challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for
diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity
assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by
elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic
epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging
modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed.
SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are
then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19
lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and;
Diagnosis/classification models. Finally, open problems and opportunities are
presented in detail.

  Epidemiology Models for COVID-19","Epidemiology models are central in understanding and controlling large scale
pandemics. Several epidemiology models require simulation-based inference such
as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit their parameters to
observations. ABC inference is highly amenable to efficient hardware
acceleration. In this work, we develop parallel ABC inference of a stochastic
epidemiology model for COVID-19. The statistical inference framework is
implemented and compared on Intel Xeon CPU, NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU and the
Graphcore Mk1 IPU, and the results are discussed in the context of their
computational architectures. Results show that GPUs are 4x and IPUs are 30x
faster than Xeon CPUs. Extensive performance analysis indicates that the
difference between IPU and GPU can be attributed to higher communication
bandwidth, closeness of memory to compute, and higher compute power in the IPU.
The proposed framework scales across 16 IPUs, with scaling overhead not
exceeding 8% for the experiments performed. We present an example of our
framework in practice, performing inference on the epidemiology model across
three countries, and giving a brief overview of the results.

automatic hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimisation combined with
HyperBand. The proposed method outperforms a traditional baseline approach by a

74.9%, or an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 80.7% by ensembling neural networks,
considering the best test set result across breathing and coughing in a

appear slightly better suited than coughing ones (76.1% vs 73.7% UAR).

worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008, and the COVID-19 has been
widely blamed on the stock market crashes. In this study, we applied the
log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time
series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market
crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both
developed and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ,
FTSE, DAX, NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. In order to effectively
distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash, we proposed using the
LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the
apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by
the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the
price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300,
BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed
endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes
for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic
instability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as
the COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock
market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not
been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE,
NIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are
exogenous, stemming from external shocks. The novel classification method of
crash types proposed in this study can also be used to analyze regime changes
of any price trajectories in global financial markets.

  Computing for COVID-19","The COVID-19 epidemic has been a significant healthcare challenge in the
United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), COVID-19 infection is transmitted predominately by respiratory droplets
generated when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. Wearing a mask is the
primary, effective, and convenient method of blocking 80% of all respiratory
infections. Therefore, many face mask detection and monitoring systems have
been developed to provide effective supervision for hospitals, airports,
publication transportation, sports venues, and retail locations. However, the
current commercial face mask detection systems are typically bundled with
specific software or hardware, impeding public accessibility. In this paper, we
propose an in-browser serverless edge-computing based face mask detection
solution, called Web-based efficient AI recognition of masks (WearMask), which
can be deployed on any common devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, computers)
that have internet connections using web browsers, without installing any
software. The serverless edge-computing design minimizes the extra hardware
costs (e.g., specific devices or cloud computing servers). The contribution of
the proposed method is to provide a holistic edge-computing framework of
integrating (1) deep learning models (YOLO), (2) high-performance neural
network inference computing framework (NCNN), and (3) a stack-based virtual
machine (WebAssembly). For end-users, our web-based solution has advantages of
(1) serverless edge-computing design with minimal device limitation and privacy
risk, (2) installation free deployment, (3) low computing requirements, and (4)
high detection speed. Our WearMask application has been launched with public

transparent tracing of COVID-19 vaccine registration, storage and delivery, and
side effects self-reporting. We present such system implementation in which
blockchain technology is used for assuring data integrity and immutability in
case of beneficiary registration for vaccination, eliminating identity thefts
and impersonations. Smart contracts are defined to monitor and track the proper
vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by
vaccine producers enabling the awareness of all network peers. For vaccine
administration, a transparent and tamper-proof side effects self-reporting
solution is provided considering person identification and administrated

network, Ropsten, considering the COVID-19 vaccine distribution tracking
conditions. The results obtained for each on-chain operation can be checked and
validated on the Etherscan, demonstrating various aspects of the proposed

  Misunderstandings","COVID-19 testing, the cornerstone for effective screening and identification
of COVID-19 cases, remains paramount as an intervention tool to curb the spread
of COVID-19 both at local and national levels. However, the speed at which the
pandemic struck and the response was rolled out, the widespread impact on
healthcare infrastructure, the lack of sufficient preparation within the public
health system, and the complexity of the crisis led to utter confusion among
test-takers. Invasion of privacy remains a crucial concern. The user experience
of test takers remains low. User friction affects user behavior and discourages
participation in testing programs. Test efficacy has been overstated. Test
results are poorly understood resulting in inappropriate follow-up
recommendations. Herein, we review the current landscape of COVID-19 testing,
identify four key challenges, and discuss the consequences of the failure to
address these challenges. The current infrastructure around testing and
information propagation is highly privacy-invasive and does not leverage
scalable digital components. In this work, we discuss challenges complicating
the existing covid-19 testing ecosystem and highlight the need to improve the
testing experience for the user and reduce privacy invasions. Digital tools
will play a critical role in resolving these challenges.

prevailing assumption in the probabilistic variant of the problem has been that
individuals in the population are infected by a disease independently. However,
this assumption rarely holds in practice, as diseases typically spread through

inspired by characteristics of COVID-19 and similar diseases, which generalizes
the traditional i.i.d. model from probabilistic group testing. Under this
infection model, we ask whether knowledge of the network structure can be
leveraged to perform group testing more efficiently, focusing specifically on
community-structured graphs drawn from the stochastic block model. Through both
theory and simulations, we show that when the network and infection parameters
are conducive to ""strong community structure,"" our proposed adaptive,
graph-aware algorithm outperforms the baseline binary splitting algorithm, and
is even order-optimal in certain parameter regimes. Finally, we derive novel
information-theoretic lower bounds which highlight the fundamental limits of
adaptive group testing in our networked setting.

Here, we perform a large-scale, spatio-temporal analysis of human mobility

aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland;
February 10 - April 26, 2020), consisting of ~1.5 billion trips. In comparison
to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by
49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than 5
people, which is estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by
venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such,
human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7-13 days ahead. A 1%
reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88-1.11% reduction in daily reported
COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via
telecommunication data can support public decision-makers in two ways. First,
it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for

importance across 2,787 counties in the United States using a data-driven
machine learning model. We trained random forest models using 23 features
representing six key influencing factors affecting pandemic spread: social
demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties,
movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure.
Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their
population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three
stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening
stage. The study aims to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which
the importance of heterogeneous features evolves in different stages; (2) The
extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varies across counties
with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to
determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social
demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and
minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of
COVID-19 across the 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features
had the highest importance in county clusters with higher population densities;
(3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social
connectedness index), had higher importance in the models for counties with
higher population densities. The results show that the data-driven machine
learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers
regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and

capitalizations have significantly different starting time profiles. This study

the creation and spread of fake news. The fake news has not only influenced
people in the wrong direction but also claimed human lives. During these
critical times of the Covid19 pandemic, it is easy to mislead people and make
them believe in fatal information. Therefore it is important to curb fake news
at source and prevent it from spreading to a larger audience. We look at
automated techniques for fake news detection from a data mining perspective. We
evaluate different supervised text classification algorithms on Contraint@AAAI
2021 Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset. The classification algorithms are
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also
evaluate the importance of unsupervised learning in the form of language model
pre-training and distributed word representations using unlabelled covid tweets
corpus. We report the best accuracy of 98.41\% on the Covid-19 Fake news
detection dataset.

  Patients","Machine Learning (ML) models typically require large-scale, balanced training
data to be robust, generalizable, and effective in the context of healthcare.
This has been a major issue for developing ML models for the
coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where data is highly imbalanced,
particularly within electronic health records (EHR) research. Conventional
approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) that often suffers from poor
margin classification. For the first time, we show that contrastive loss (CL)
improves the performance of CEL especially for imbalanced EHR data and the
related COVID-19 analyses. This study has been approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We use EHR data
from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict
mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential
architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models
are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and
restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently
outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with
differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For
the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is
able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL
in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to
three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature
importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used
for EHR ML work in general.

monitoring blood volume changes from a camera. It may be especially useful for
widespread contact-less health monitoring when used to analyze face video from
consumer-grade visible-light cameras. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the
widespread use of protective face masks to prevent virus transmission. We found
that occlusions from face masks affect face video-based rPPG as the mean
absolute error of blood volume estimation is nearly doubled when the face is
partially occluded by protective masks. To our knowledge, this paper is the
first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of blood volume pulse
estimation and offers several novel elements: (a) two publicly available pulse
estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61 masked subjects, (b)
evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D convolutional neural network
trained on videos of full (unmasked) faces and synthetically generated masks,
and (c) data augmentation method (a generator adding a synthetic mask to a face
video). Our findings help identify how face masks degrade accuracy of face
video analysis, and we discuss paths toward more robust pulse estimation in
their presence. The datasets and source codes of all proposed methods are

  glimpse of the carbon-free future","The COVID-19 pandemic led to partial or total lockdowns in several countries
during the first half of 2020, which in turn caused a depressed electricity
demand. In Great Britain (GB), this low demand combined with large renewable
output at times, created conditions that were not expected until renewable
capacity increases to meet emissions targets in coming years. The GB system
experienced periods of very high instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous
renewables, compromising system stability due to the lack of inertia in the
grid. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the consequences of the lockdown on
the GB electricity system is provided, focusing on the ancillary services
procured to guarantee stability. Ancillary-services costs increased by
{\pounds}200m in the months of May to July 2020 compared to the same period in
2019 (a threefold increase), highlighting the importance of ancillary services
in low-carbon systems. Furthermore, a frequency-secured scheduling model is
used in the present paper to showcase the future trends that GB is expected to
experience, as penetration of renewables increases on the road to net-zero
emissions by 2050. Several sensitivities are considered, demonstrating that the
share of total operating costs represented by ancillary services could reach

  Argentina and forecasting mental health and emotions","Purpose. We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and
emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based
on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits
anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.
Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which
link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines
for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation
with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support
their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for
the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series
forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the
emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders
can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when
limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).
Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict
mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective
level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a
forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or
group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe
that this work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological
processes related to crisis manifest in social media, being a valuable asset
for the design, implementation and monitoring of health prevention and
communication policies.

the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. It is extraordinarily difficult, however, to
deduce a generalized framework to assess the relative airborne transmission
risk with respect to other modes. This is due to the complex biophysics
entailed in such phenomena. Since the SARS outbreak in 2002, Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been one of the main tools scientists used to
investigate AT of respiratory viruses. Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive
and physically plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand
SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission patterns. In addition to validation
requirements, for any CFD model to be of epistemic value to the scientific
community; it must be reproducible. In 2020, more than 45 published studies
investigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using CFD.
Here, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss
their reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using
a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD
simulations of SARS-CoV-2 AT. The proposed index $(0 \leq R^{CFD}_j \leq 1)$
relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent
the possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of
23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index $(R^{CFD}_j\geq 0.9)$
while the remaining 87% were found generally irreproducible $(R^{CFD}_j<0.9)$.
Without reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will
remain hindered, fragmented and limited. In conclusion, I call the scientific
community to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and publishing CFD
simulations in COVID-19 research.

  timescales: the case of Italy","A great issue of discussion of an infectious disease is its basic
reproduction number R0, which provides an estimation of the contagiousness of
the disease. When R0 > 1, the disease spread will potentially lead to an
outbreak, such that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. During the evolution of
an outbreak, various non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact
of which is frequently assessed by the reduction that they introduce to the
effective reproduction number Rt; reduction below 1 is an indication of
eventual dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0
essentially expresses the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, in this
work, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that
during the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various
interventions were in place, Rt had a clear relation with the explosive
timescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is
shown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of
the epidemics implies Rt > 1, while its absence implies Rt < 1. In addition, as
this timescale converges/diverges with the immediately slowest one, Rt
approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that
timescale analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various
interventions, since it reflects the insight provided by the effective
reproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population
model, nor the parameter estimation process followed for model calibration.

contains two ankyrin repeat binding motifs (S-ARBMs) and some TRP cation
channels, implicated in OTC, have ankyrin repeat domains (TRPs-ARDs), I
hypothesized that interaction of S-ARBMs and TRPs-ARDs could dysregulate the
function of the latter and thus explains OTCD. Of note, some TRPs-ARDs are
expressed in the olfactory epithelium, taste buds, trigeminal neurons in the
oronasal cavity and vagal neurons in the trachea/lungs. Furthermore, this
hypothesis is supported by studies that have shown: (i) respiratory viruses
interact with TRPA1 and TRPV1 on sensory nerves and epithelial cells in the
airways, (ii) the respiratory pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is similar
to lungs injuries produced by the sensitization of TRPV1 and TRPV4, and (iii)
resolvin D1 and D2 shown to reduce SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation, directly
inhibit TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV3 and TRPV4. Herein, results of blind dockings of
S-ARBMs, 408-RQIAPG-413 (in RBD but distal from the ACE-2 binding region) and
905-RFNGIG-910 (in HR1), into TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPV4 suggest that S-ARBMs
interact with ankyrin repeat 6 of TRPA1 near an active site, and ankyrin repeat
3-4 of TRPV1 near cysteine 258 supposed to be implicated in the formation of
inter-subunits disulfide bond. These findings suggest that S-ARBMs affect
TRPA1, TRPV1 and TRPV4 function by interfering with channel assembly and
trafficking. After an experimental confirmation of these interactions, among
possible preventive treatments against COVID-19, the use of pharmacological
manipulation (probably inhibition) of TRPs-ARDs to control or mitigate
sustained pro-inflammatory response.

and institutional crises. Measures taken to slow the spread of the virus have
fostered significant strain between authorities and citizens, leading to waves
of social unrest and anti-government demonstrations. We study the temporal
nature of pandemic-related disorder events as tallied by the ""COVID-19 Disorder
Tracker"" initiative by focusing on the three countries with the largest number
of incidents, India, Israel, and Mexico. By fitting Poisson and Hawkes
processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are
inter-dependent and self-excite in all three countries. Geographic clustering
confirms these features at the subnational level, indicating that nationwide
disorders emerge as the convergence of meso-scale patterns of self-excitation.
Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations
of events between subnational clusters; these are discussed in the context of
specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most
territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in
response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the
shortest period of influence following an event, as well as the strongest
nationwide synchrony. In Mexico, where complete lockdown orders were never
mandated, reactivity and nationwide synchrony are lowest. Our work highlights
the need for authorities to promote local information campaigns to ensure that
livelihoods and virus containment policies are not perceived as mutually
exclusive.

people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics.
Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased

of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective
complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a
neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as
part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting
factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient

We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a
multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage
explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2,
with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two
board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience,
respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19

97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance
validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent
with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant
critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of
deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19

  Testbed for Sustainable and Innovative Environments (ETSIE) using Fuzzy
  Cognitive Maps","This paper sketches a new approach using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to
operably map and simulate digital transformation in architecture and urban
planning. Today these processes are poorly understood. Many current studies on
digital transformation are only treating questions of economic efficiency.
Sustainability and social impact only play a minor role. Decisive definitions,
concepts and terms stay unclear. Therefore this paper develops an open
experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for
three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional
growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable
COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same
number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the
initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted
differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis.
The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one
of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It
is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very
similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to
accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does
not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development.
Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections
an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible.

  Evidence using panel data from Japan","COVID-19 has led to school closures in Japan to cope with the pandemic. Under
the state of emergency, in addition to school closure, after-school care has
not been sufficiently supplied. We independently collected individual level
data through internet surveys to construct short panel data from mid-March to
mid-June 2020, which covered before and after the state of emergency. We
analyze how the presence of school-aged children influences their parents views
about working from home. After controlling for various factors using a fixed
effects model, we find that in cases where parents were workers, and the
children are (1) in primary school, parents are willing to promote working from
home. If children are (2) in junior high school, the parents view is hardly
affected. (3) Surprisingly, workers whose children are primary school pupils
are most likely to support promotion of working from home after schools reopen.
Due to school closure and a lack of after-school care, parents need to work

  Examinations Using Deep Learning Approach -- A Case Study","This study addresses the current issues in online assessments, which are
particularly relevant during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our focus is on academic
dishonesty associated with online assessments. We investigated the prevalence
of potential e-cheating using a case study and propose preventive measures that
could be implemented. We have utilised an e-cheating intelligence agent as a
mechanism for detecting the practices of online cheating, which is composed of
two major modules: the internet protocol (IP) detector and the behaviour
detector. The intelligence agent monitors the behaviour of the students and has
the ability to prevent and detect any malicious practices. It can be used to
assign randomised multiple-choice questions in a course examination and be
integrated with online learning programs to monitor the behaviour of the
students. The proposed method was tested on various data sets confirming its
effectiveness. The results revealed accuracies of 68% for the deep neural
network (DNN); 92% for the long-short term memory (LSTM); 95% for the
DenseLSTM; and, 86% for the recurrent neural network (RNN).

Furthermore, initial statistical analyses also indicate a gender difference in
mean gains in favour of females at the 95% significance level (for paired data,

were aware of their conceptual performance in physics, and the main constraint
to their studies was due to difficulties associated with being online. As such,
the change in pedagogy and the stresses of lockdown were found to not be
suggestive of a depreciation of FCI gains and grades.

multi-week, multi-site observational study was undertaken outside of 19 New
York City medical facilities during the peak of the city's initial COVID-19

future research on the way people interact with three-dimensional vector
environments. Anonymized data were collected via smart phones. Each data record
includes the time, data, and location of an individual leaving a healthcare
facility, their routing, interactions with the build environment, other

(QoS) and maintaining low latency communication are of paramount importance.
Development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-aided heterogeneous cellular
network is a promising solution to satisfy the aforementioned requirements.
There are, however, key challenges ahead, on the one hand, it is challenging to
optimally increase content diversity in caching nodes to mitigate the network's
traffic over the backhaul. On the other hand is the challenge of attenuated
UAVs' signal in indoor environments, which increases users' access delay and
UAVs' energy consumption. To address these challenges, we incorporate UAVs, as
mobile caching nodes, together with Femto Access points (FAPs) to increase the
network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments. Referred to as the
Cluster-centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, a two-phase
clustering framework is proposed for optimal FAPs' formation and UAVs'
deployment. The proposed CCUF leads to an increase in the cache diversity, a
reduction in the users' access delay, and significant reduction in UAVs' energy
consumption. To mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas, the
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) approach is integrated within the CCUF
framework. In contrary to existing works, we analytically compute the optimal
number of FAPs in each cluster to increase the cache-hit probability of coded
content placement. Furthermore, the optimal number of coded contents to be
stored in each caching node is computed to increase the cache-hit-ratio,
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and
decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content

infectious diseases, including Legionnaire's disease, gastroenteritis-causing
norovirus, and most recently COVID-19. Respiratory droplets are known to be the
most prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes
may exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and
stool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of
microorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in
public restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19,
especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot
traffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of
aerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by
flushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that
the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets
in the size range 0.3$\mu m$ to 3$\mu m$, which can reach heights of at least
1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them
completely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps
between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol
levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol
levels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted
during the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate
ventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help
prevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of
airborne disease transmission.

mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages
of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the

We trained Support Vector Machine classifiers to retrieve relevant tweets and
classify tweets containing credible information and misinformation for each

series for both topics, we find that the previously predominant credible
information can lead to the decrease of misinformation (i.e. suppression) with
a time lag. The research findings provide empirical evidence for suppressing
misinformation with credible information in complex online environments and
suggest practical strategies for future information management during crises

magnetic resonance exams for respiratory-triggered imaging, chronic pulmonary

numerous respiratory devices have been developed, they are often in direct

study, we developed a novel, non-invasive, and contactless magnetic sensing
platform that can precisely monitor breathing, movement, or sleep patterns of a

resonance (MLCR) sensor converts the magnetic oscillations generated by
breathing of the patient into an impedance spectrum, which allows for a deep
analysis of breath variation to identify respiratory-related diseases like
COVID-19. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity, the MLCR sensor yields a distinct
breathing pattern for each patient tested. The sensor also provides an accurate
measure of the strength of breath at multiple stages as well as anomalous
variations in respiratory rate and amplitude. This suggests that the MLCR
sensor can detect symptoms of COVID-19 in a patient due to shortness of breath
or difficulty breathing as well as track the progress of the disease in real
time.

household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G

between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more
palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these
inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective
of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why
Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of
non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why
targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable
and empirically grounded mathematical model, shows how modest tailoring of
mainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping against
establishment guidance. Our conclusions should also apply to other social media

measures effectively slowed disease transmission in many countries in Europe
and Asia, but the same benefits have not been observed in some developing
countries such as Brazil. In part, this is due to a failure to organise
systematic testing campaigns at nationwide or even regional levels. To gain
effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries,
particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by
an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities.
The economic infrastructure of the country, often concentrated in a few cities,
forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces
strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission. In the present study, we
develop a smart testing strategy to identify geographic regions where COVID-19
testing could most effectively be deployed to limit further disease
transmission. The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and
demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and
city-specific social-distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity
of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution,
we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to
show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while
reducing the need for social-distancing measures, thus returning life to a
so-called new normal, even when testing capacity is limited.

and the other available on request. After combining the data sets, the features
were obtained from the cough sounds using the mel-frequency cepstral
coefficients (MFCCs) method, and then they were classified with seven different
machine learning classifiers. To determine the optimum values of
hyperparameters for MFCCs and classifiers, the leave-one-out cross-validation
(LOO-CV) strategy was implemented. Based on the results, the k-nearest
neighbors classifier based on the Euclidean distance (k-NN Euclidean) with the

best and most effective features were determined for each classifier using the
sequential forward selection (SFS) method. According to the results, the
proposed system is excellent compared with similar studies in the literature
and can be easily used in smartphones and facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19

almost the most urgent public health events worldwide. Computed tomography (CT)
is a significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automated
segmentation of lung infection in COVID-19 CT images will greatly assist
diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate and automatic
segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections remains to be challenging. In this
paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion
segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual
attention mechanism to address the issues above. We introduce a dilated
convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive field, which
refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we
present a dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are
inserted to skip connection and model decoder respectively. The dual attention
mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce semantic gap between
different levels of the model. The proposed method has been evaluated on
open-source dataset and outperforms cutting edges methods in semantic
segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves a Dice
score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified
D2A U-Net without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other
models trained from scratch, which still outperforms popular U-Net family
models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626. Our experiment
results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual attention
mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which
improves sensitivity to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant
increase to Dice score.

  Events","Early prediction of patients at risk of clinical deterioration can help
physicians intervene and alter their clinical course towards better outcomes.
In addition to the accuracy requirement, early warning systems must make the
predictions early enough to give physicians enough time to intervene.
Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since
being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in
clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early
prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical
deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events.
The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population
at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model
was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and
mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict
mortality and the need for vasopressors on the MIMIC III dataset. Our model
first separates each feature into multiple ranges and then uses logistic
regression with lasso penalization to select the subset of ranges for each
feature. The model training is completely automated and doesn't require expert
knowledge like other early warning scores. We compare our model to the Modified
Early Warning Score (MEWS) and quick SOFA (qSOFA), commonly used in hospitals.
We show that our model outperforms these models in the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) while having a similar or better median
detection time on all clinical events, even when using fewer features. Unlike
MEWS and qSOFA, our model can be entirely automated without requiring any
manually recorded features. We also show that discretization improves model
performance by comparing our model to a baseline logistic regression model.

  Knowledge","Selecting causal inference models for estimating individualized treatment
effects (ITE) from observational data presents a unique challenge since the
counterfactual outcomes are never observed. The problem is challenged further
in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access
to labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that
achieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples
are available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the
predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between
the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the
model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with
identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by
existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in
the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains
to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods
under the UDA setting. In particular, we propose selecting models whose
predictions of interventions' effects satisfy known causal structures in the
target domain. Experimentally, our method selects ITE models that are more
robust to covariate shifts on several healthcare datasets, including estimating

released to the broad scientific community to accelerate biomedical research.
In addition, by performing the domain expert curated study, we show that the
systems are able to discover on-going research findings such as the
relationship between COVID-19 and oxytocin hormone.

  text mining","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 is an ongoing
pandemic. There are ongoing studies with up to hundreds of publications
uploaded to databases daily. We are exploring the use-case of artificial
intelligence and natural language processing in order to efficiently sort
through these publications. We demonstrate that clinical trial information,
preclinical studies, and a general topic model can be used as text mining data
intelligence tools for scientists all over the world to use as a resource for
their own research. To evaluate our method, several metrics are used to measure
the information extraction and clustering results. In addition, we demonstrate
that our workflow not only have a use-case for COVID-19, but for other disease
areas as well. Overall, our system aims to allow scientists to more efficiently
research coronavirus. Our automatically updating modules are available on our
information portal at https://ghddi-ailab.github.io/Targeting2019-nCoV/ for

to diagnose COVID-19 using end-to-end deep learning from a crowd-sourced
dataset of audio samples, achieving ROC-AUC of 0.846; (II) Our model, the
COVID-19 Identification ResNet, (CIdeR), has potential for rapid scalability,
minimal cost and improving performance as more data becomes available. This
could enable regular COVID-19 testing at apopulation scale; (III) We introduce
a novel modelling strategy using a custom deep neural network to diagnose
COVID-19 from a joint breath and cough representation; (IV) We release our four
stratified folds for cross parameter optimisation and validation on a standard
public corpus and details on the models for reproducibility and future
reference.

the risk factor of mental health during covid 19 or lockdown. Although few
studies have been conducted on the role about the effect of social media use on
mental health during lockdown and impact on human reactive nature during
lockdown. As a rapidly spreading pandemic, a biomedical disease has serious
physical and tremendous mental health implications. An occupational community
of internal migrant workers is one of the most vulnerable, but neglected, and
is likely to develop psychological ill-effects due to COVID-19's double whammy
impact. Mental health is a crucial aspect that needs to be addressed during
this lock-down as all modes of communication revolve around the virus. There
are many difficulties with the unprecedented changes that have occurred so
quickly due to the pandemic and stay-at - home confinement to achieve social
distance and mitigate the risk of infection. These include impaired health,
well-being, and sleep as a result of daily routine disruption, anxiety, worry,
isolation, greater stress on family and work, and excessive screen time. An
essential part of our overall health and well-being is mental and emotional
health. An important skill is managing emotions and maintaining emotional
balance. It helps you face challenges and stress when you manage your emotional
health. Lack of skills in emotional regulation may lead to poor mental health
and relationship difficulties. It is as important to look after our mental
health as it is to look after our physical health. For mental health
professionals, the pandemic has also brought many ethical challenges.

  Approach to COVID-19 Vaccination Coordination","In this early draft, we describe a decentralized, app-based approach to
COVID-19 vaccine distribution that facilitates zero knowledge verification,
dynamic vaccine scheduling, continuous symptoms reporting, access to aggregate
analytics based on population trends and more. To ensure equity, our solution
is developed to work with limited internet access as well. In addition, we
describe the six critical functions that we believe last mile vaccination
management platforms must perform, examine existing vaccine management systems,
and present a model for privacy-focused, individual-centric solutions.
