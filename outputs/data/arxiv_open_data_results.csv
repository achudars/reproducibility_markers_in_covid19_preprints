Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has raised global public health concerns
regarding the current situation and its future evolution. Here we propose an
integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME region
and importations in Europe to assess transmission scenario and incidence of
sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model
integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the
zoonotic/environmental transmission and underascertainment. Maximum likelihood
estimates for the ME region indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic
(R=0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30-0.77) associated with a 0.28 (95% CI
0.12-0.85) daily rate of sporadic introductions. Infections in the region
appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with
possible underascertainment (95% CI of estimated to observed sporadic cases in
the range 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of
flight passenger data from the region indicate areas at high risk of
importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security,
this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates,
suggests reinforced surveillance to limit underascertainment, and calls for
increased alertness in high-risk areas worldwide.

  modifications to spike protein activation sites at two discrete positions","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is associated with mutations in the
feline coronavirus (FCoV) genome that are thought to convert the subclinical
feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) into the lethal feline infectious peritonitis
virus (FIPV). A key feature of FIPV, not shared with FECV, is the productive
infection of macrophages. Therefore mutations in proteins that govern cell
tropism, such as the spike glycoprotein, may play an important role in FIP
progression. In a prior study, involving a limited number of samples, we have
shown an association of FIP with mutations in the protease cleavage-activation
site located between the receptor-binding and fusion domains of the FCoV spike
(S1/S2). Here, we extend these studies to investigate a larger sample set and
to obtain a more refined analysis of the mutations at this S1/S2 site. Our
larger data set more clearly shows that the mutations acquired by FIPV at S1/S2
are also accompanied by additional mutations at a second protease
cleavage-activation site located in the fusion domain (S2'), adjacent to the
viral fusion peptide. Overall, our data indicate a pattern of mutations across
the two protease recognition sites that results in substitutions, and/or
altered recognition, of critical basic/polar amino acid residues needed for
virus activation in the enteric tract. Typically, FIPVs have substitutions of
non-polar, aliphatic or aromatic residues in the protease recognition sites.
These changes likely modulate the proteolytic activation of the virus and its
ability to productively infect macrophages in vivo.

  multivariate autoregressive models","It is well recognised that animal and plant pathogens form complex ecological
communities of interacting organisms within their hosts. Although community
ecology approaches have been applied to determine pathogen interactions at the
within-host scale, methodologies enabling robust inference of the
epidemiological impact of pathogen interactions are lacking. Here we developed
a novel statistical framework to identify statistical covariances from the
infection time-series of multiple pathogens simultaneously. Our framework
extends Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models to analyse multivariate
time series data by accounting for within- and between-year dependencies in
infection risk and incorporating a between-pathogen covariance matrix which we
estimate. Importantly, our approach accounts for possible confounding drivers
of temporal patterns in pathogen infection frequencies, enabling robust
inference of pathogen-pathogen interactions. We illustrate the validity of our
statistical framework using simulated data and applied it to diagnostic data
available for five respiratory viruses co-circulating in a major urban
population between 2005 and 2013: adenovirus, human coronavirus, human
metapneumovirus, influenza B virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We found
positive and negative covariances indicative of epidemiological interactions
among specific virus pairs. This statistical framework enables a community
ecology perspective to be applied to infectious disease epidemiology with
important utility for public health planning and preparedness.

  Mid Infrared Photonic Spectroscopy","We propose an on-chip mid-infrared (MIR) photonic spectroscopy platform for
aerosol characterization to obtain highly discriminatory information on the

environmental, climactic, warfare threat detection, and pulmonary healthcare
applications. Further, there are a number of unintended situations for
potential exposure to bioaerosols such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi. For

Currently, chemical characterization of aerosols is performed using FTIR

Raman spectroscopy. Both techniques use free space bench-top geometries. Here,
we propose miniaturized on-chip MIR photonics-based aerosol spectroscopy
consisting of a broadband spiral-waveguide sensor that significantly enhances

made of a chalcogenide glass material (Ge23Sb7S70) which shows a broad

will readily complement existing photonic resonator-based particle sizing and

  Global Pandemic: Comparative Benchmark and Novel Multialgorithmic Approach","The massive availability of cameras results in a wide variability of imaging
conditions, producing large intra-class variations and a significant
performance drop if heterogeneous images are compared for person recognition.
However, as biometrics is deployed, it is common to replace damaged or obsolete
hardware, or to exchange information between heterogeneous applications.
Variations in spectral bands can also occur. For example, surveillance face
images (typically acquired in the visible spectrum, VIS) may need to be
compared against a legacy iris database (typically acquired in near-infrared,
NIR). Here, we propose a multialgorithmic approach to cope with periocular
images from different sensors. With face masks in the front line against
COVID-19, periocular recognition is regaining popularity since it is the only
face region that remains visible. We integrate different comparators with a
fusion scheme based on linear logistic regression, in which scores are
represented by log-likelihood ratios. This allows easy interpretation of scores
and the use of Bayes thresholds for optimal decision-making, since scores from
different comparators are in the same probabilistic range. We evaluate our
approach in the context of the Cross-Eyed Competition, whose aim was to compare
recognition approaches when NIR and VIS periocular images are matched. Our
approach achieves EER=0.2% and FRR of just 0.47% at FAR=0.01%, representing the
best overall approach of the competition. Experiments are also reported with a
database of VIS images from different smartphones. We also discuss the impact
of template size and computation times, with the most computationally heavy
comparator playing an important role in the results. Lastly, the proposed
method is shown to outperform other popular fusion approaches, such as the
average of scores, SVMs or Random Forest.

structures. In recent years, a variety of graph neural networks (GNNs) have
been successfully applied for representation learning and prediction on such

extends the popular graph convolutional network (GCN) for learning

proposed tensor approach and spectral convolution of tensors. The proposed
method TM-GCN is consistent with the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN)
framework, accounting for both spatial and temporal message passing. Numerical
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed
method for edge classification and link prediction tasks on dynamic graphs. We
also consider an application related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and show how our

change in trend is typically found to have occurred at the most recent data

index has the interpretation of the probability that a latent characteristic
has changed monotonicity at any given time conditional on observed data. We

  Devices","In this paper, a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is
considered in which multiple IoT devices must transmit timely updates on the
status information of a common underlying physical process to a common
destination. In particular, a real-world IoT scenario is considered in which
multiple (partially) observed status information by different IoT devices are
required at the destination, so that the real-time status of the physical
process can be properly re-constructed. By taking into account such correlated
status information at the IoT devices, the problem of IoT device scheduling is
studied in order to jointly minimize the average age of information (AoI) at
the destination and the average energy cost at the IoT devices. Particularly,
two types of IoT devices are considered: Type-I devices whose status updates
randomly arrive and type-II devices whose status updates can be
generated-at-will with an associated sampling cost. This stochastic problem is
formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP).
The optimal scheduling policy is shown to be threshold-based with respect to
the AoI at the destination, and the threshold is non-increasing with the
channel condition of each device. For a special case in which all devices are
type-II, the original MDP can be reduced to an MDP with much smaller state and
action spaces. The optimal policy is further shown to have a similar
threshold-based structure and the threshold is non-decreasing with an energy
cost function of the devices. Simulation results illustrate the structure of
the optimal policy and show the effectiveness of the optimal policy compared
with a myopic baseline policy.

States attained its lowest level since 1973. If transit agencies hope to
reverse this trend, they must understand how their service allocation policies
affect ridership. This paper is among the first to model ridership trends on a
hyper-local level over time. A Poisson fixed-effects model is developed to
evaluate the ridership elasticity to frequency using passenger count data from
Portland, Miami, Minneapolis/St-Paul, and Atlanta between 2012 and 2018. In
every agency, ridership is found to be elastic to frequency when observing the
variation between individual route-segments at one point in time. In other
words, the most frequent routes are already the most productive. When observing
the variation within each route-segment over time, however, ridership is
inelastic; each additional vehicle-trip is expected to generate less ridership
than the average bus already on the route. In three of the four agencies, the
elasticity is a decreasing function of prior frequency, meaning that
low-frequency routes are the most sensitive to frequency change. This paper can
help transit agencies anticipate the marginal effect of shifting service
throughout the network. As the quality and availability of passenger count data
improve, this paper can serve as the methodological basis to explore the
dynamics of bus ridership.

adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation

of Covid-19 in China, we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired
methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the

helping public health planning and policymaking.

  of recent COVID-19 outbreak in Mainland China","The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland China is characterized by a
distinctive algebraic, sub-exponential increase of confirmed cases during the
early phase of the epidemic, contrasting an initial exponential growth expected
for an unconstrained outbreak with sufficiently large reproduction rate.
Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland
China, the scaling law $t^{\mu}$ is surprisingly universal, with a range of
exponents $\mu=2.1\pm0.3$. The universality of this behavior indicates that
despite social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical
heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by
fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological
models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of
containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To
this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of
symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in
response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of
parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases
and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit
the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or
oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of
local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the
observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective
contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a
substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the
implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19
secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent
infectious diseases.

them are based on the classical epidemiological approach that assumes an
exponential growth, but a few studies report that a power-law scaling may
provide a better fit to the currently available data. Hereby, we examine the
data in China (01/20/2020--02/24/2020), and indeed find that the growth closely
follows a power-law kinetics over a significantly wide time period. The
exponents are $2.48(20)$, $2.21(6)$ and $4.26(12)$ for the number of confirmed
infections, deaths and cured cases, respectively, indicating an underlying
small-world network structure in the pandemic. While no obvious deviations from
the power-law growth can be seen yet for the number of deaths and cured cases,
negative deviations have clearly appeared in the number of infections,
particularly that for the region outside Hubei. This suggests the beginning of
the slowing-down of the virus spreading due to the huge containment effort.
Meanwhile, we find that despite the dramatic difference in magnitudes, the
growth kinetics of the infection number exhibits much similarity for Hubei
province and the region outside Hubei. On this basis, in log-log plot, we
rescale the infection number for the region outside Hubei such that it overlaps
as much as possible with the total infection number in China, from which an
approximate extrapolation yields the maximum of the pandemic around March 3,
2020, with the number of infections about $83,000$. Further, by analyzing the
kinetics of the mortality in log-log scale, we obtains a rough estimate that
near March 3, the death rate of COVID-19 would be about $4.7\%\thicksim 5.0\%$
for Hubei province and $0.7\%\thicksim1.0\%$ for the region outside Hubei. We
emphasize that our predictions may be quantitatively unreliable, since the data

(RT-PCR) detection of viral RNA from sputum or nasopharyngeal swab has a
relatively low positive rate in the early stage to determine COVID-19 (named by
the World Health Organization). The manifestations of computed tomography (CT)
imaging of COVID-19 had their own characteristics, which are different from
other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia. Therefore,
clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type
of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early
screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral
pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning
techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a
3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated
images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and
irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence
scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection
type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or
Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the
overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The
deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early
screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary
diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.

of the public interest in COVID-19 through Google Trends data. The model we
implement is developed to be easily adapted to a data scientist's preferred
method for continuous data, which is done to aid future analyses of this
important dataset. This dataset consists of multiple response types (e.g.,
continuous-valued, count-valued, binomial counts). Thus, we introduce a
reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that ""converts"" a statistical
model for continuous responses (the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for
multi-response data sets. To do this, we transform the data such that the
continuous-valued transformed data can be reasonably modeled using the
preferred model and the transformation itself is treated as unknown. The
implementation of our approach involves two steps. The first step produces
posterior replicates of the transformed data using a latent conjugate
multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the
posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We refer to our model as
the hierarchical generalized transformation (HGT) model. In a simulation, we
demonstrate the flexibility of the HGT model by incorporating two different
preferred models: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the spatial
mixed effects (spatio-temporal mixed effects) models.

close contact during pedestrians' daily activities on the cruise ship.
  Measurements and main results: Three types of simulation scenarios are

following crucial questions for COVID-19: (Q1) Is it possible to contain
COVID-19? (Q2) When will be the peak and the end of the epidemic? (Q3) How do
the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of disease? (Q4) What is the
ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity?
(Q5) How effective are the social distancing approaches? (Q6) What is the ratio
of the population infected in the long run? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a
time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time
series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at
time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models
and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by
China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed
cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely
predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission
rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that
day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend
our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and
undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is
characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related
to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least
1-1/$R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5) and (Q6), we analyze
the independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration
random graph. By relating the propagation probabilities in the IC model to the
transmission rates and recovering rates in the SIR model, we show 2 approaches
of social distancing that can lead to a reduction of $R_0$.

estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into
seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and

discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is
in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human
transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may
become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the
virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index
is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high

(M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds
(COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health
interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the
infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and
below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0
coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19
outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection
threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality
rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity
UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of
coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed
from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of
infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of
which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health
interventions.

more likely a pandemic threat worldwide. Given that the disease has not
approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or
clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and
creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the
newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and
thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as
ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1
protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based
on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active
site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of
interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory
potency of candidates are as follows
Tipranavir>Indinavir>Atazanavir>Darunavir>Ritonavir>Amprenavir for HIV-1
protease inhibitors and Cefditoren>Cefixime>Erythromycin>Clarithromycin for
anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and
the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their
metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for
their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey
by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus

coming summer in the northern hemisphere will reduce the transmission intensity
of COVID-19 with increased humidity and temperature. In this paper, we
investigate this problem using the data from the cases with symptom-onset dates
from January 19 to February 10, 2020 for 100 Chinese cities, and cases with
confirmed dates from March 15 to April 25 for 1,005 U.S. counties. Statistical
analysis is performed to assess the relationship between the transmissibility
of COVID-19 and the temperature/humidity, by controlling for various
demographic, socio-economic, geographic, healthcare and policy factors and
correcting for cross-sectional correlation. We find a similar influence of the
temperature and relative humidity on effective reproductive number (R values)
of COVID-19 for both China and the U.S. before lockdown in both countries:
one-degree Celsius increase in temperature reduces R value by about 0.023
(0.026 (95% CI [-0.0395,-0.0125]) in China and 0.020 (95% CI [-0.0311,
-0.0096]) in the U.S.), and one percent relative humidity rise reduces R value
by 0.0078 (0.0076 (95% CI [-0.0108,-0.0045]) in China and 0.0080 (95% CI
[-0.0150,-0.0010]) in the U.S.). If assuming a 30 degree and 25 percent
increase in temperature and relative humidity from winter to summer in the
northern hemisphere, we expect the R values to decline about 0.89 (0.69 by
temperature and 0.20 by humidity). Given the notion that the non-intervened R
values are around 2.5 to 3, only weather factors cannot make the R values below
their critical condition of R<1, under which the epidemic diminishes gradually.
Therefore, public health intervention such as social distancing is crucial to
block the transmission of COVID-19 even in summer.

How
different is it from other coronaviruses? Will it be attenuated or become more
virulent? Which animals may be its original host? In this study, we collected
and analyzed nearly thirty thousand publicly available complete genome
sequences for COVID-19 virus from 79 different countries, the previously known
flu-causing coronaviruses (HCov-229E, HCov-OC43, HCov-NL63 and HCov-HKU1) and
the lethal, pathogenic viruses, SARS, MERS, Victoria, Lassa, Yamagata, Ebola,
and Dengue. We found strong similarities between the current circulating
COVID-19 and SARS and MERS, as well as COVID-19 in rhinolophines and pangolins.
On the contrary, COVID-19 shares little similarity with the flu-causing
coronaviruses and the other known viruses. Strikingly, we observed that the
divergence of COVID-19 strains isolated from human hosts has steadily increased
from December 2019 to May 2020, suggesting COVID-19 is actively evolving in
human hosts. In this paper, we first propose a novel MLCS algorithm NP-MLCS1
for the big sequence analysis, which can calculate the common model for
COVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide important information for vaccine
and antibody development. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolution
trees of the human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strains
from 79 countries. This finding has important implications to the management of
COVID-19 and the development of vaccines and medications.

  data of China","During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also
challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up
actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a
reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of
various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat
of COVID-19 pandemics now.
  Based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported
during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast
ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference
methods and five dynamical models. We highlight the significance of a well
balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting,
as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike
information criterion, root mean square error and robustness index to evaluate
various epidemic models/methods.
  Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a
crucial role in forecasting. We further notice the Logistic function steadily
underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an
overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time
dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective
reproduction number into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in
the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential
growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the
inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast.
Towards the ODE models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are shown to be suitable
for modeling the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the
inclusion of self-protection and quarantine.

coronavirus disease, is a global threat. To better understand viral tropism, we
assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the
viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in
single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals
generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as
the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut
epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree
reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and
ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells
analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins
towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity.
Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway
epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly
enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways
might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral
pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral
infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the
Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the
compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and
ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2
infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral
transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.

  Results show that this method works well for China: on day 25 we could have
predicted well the outcome for the next 35 days. The same method has been
applied to Italy and South Korea, and forecasts for the forthcoming weeks are
included in this work. For Italy, forecasts based on data collected up to today
(24 March) indicate that number of observed cases could grow from the current
value of 69,176, to between 101k-180k, with a 50% probability of being between
110k-135k. For South Korea, it suggests that the number of observed cases could
grow from the current value of 9,018 (as of the 23rd of March), to values
between 8,500 and 9,300, with a 50% probability of being between 8,700 and

possible and could be developed following key ideas and methods from weather

model the spatio-temporal distribution of COVID-19 infections at local level.
Data time horizon ranges from 26 February 20020, which is the date when the
first case not directly connected with China has been discovered in northern
Italy, to 18 March 2020. An endemic-epidemic multivariate time-series
mixed-effects generalized linear model for areal disease counts has been
implemented to understand and predict spatio-temporal diffusion of the
phenomenon. Previous literature has shown that these class of models provide
reliable predictions of infectious diseases in time and space. Three
subcomponents characterize the estimated model. The first is related to the
evolution of the disease over time; the second is characterized by transmission
of the illness among inhabitants of the same province; the third remarks the
effects of spatial neighbourhood and try to capture the contagion effects of
nearby areas. Focusing on the aggregated time-series of the daily counts in
Italy, the contribution of any of the three subcomponents do not dominate on
the others and our predictions are excellent for the whole country, with an
error of 3 per thousand compared to the late available data. At local level,
instead, interesting distinct patterns emerge. In particular, the provinces
first concerned by containment measures are those that are not affected by the
effects of spatial neighbours. On the other hand, for the provinces the are
currently strongly affected by contagions, the component accounting for the
spatial interaction with surrounding areas is prevalent. Moreover, the proposed
model provides good forecasts of the number of infections at local level while
controlling for delayed reporting.

  population in China","Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of
the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental
ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

Transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers rendered

against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the
initial outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical

exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic growth rate as input. We then
explore reduction of the basic reproduction number R_0 through specific disease
control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing

combination, their effects on R_0 multiply. We also compare our model behaviour

L'evy jumps, which can give us a good insight into the evolution of the

2019. Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are
limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal
propagation of the first wave of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to
other global locations. We provide a comprehensive picture of the spatial
propagation from Hubei to other provinces in China in terms of distance,
population size, and human mobility and their scaling relations. Since strict
quarantine has been usually applied between cities, more insight about the
temporal evolution of the disease can be obtained by analyzing the epidemic
within cities, especially the time evolution of the infection, death, and
recovery rates which affected by policies. We study and compare the infection
rate in different cities in China and provinces in Italy and find that the
disease spread is characterized by a two-stages process. At early times, at
order of few days, the infection rate is close to a constant probably due to
the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection symptoms are
observed. Then at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to
quarantines. The time evolution of the death and recovery rates also

identification and quarantine of the infected individuals, determination of
whom they have had close contact with in the previous days and weeks, and
decontamination of locations the infected individual has visited. Achieving
containment demands accurate and timely collection of the infected individual's
location and contact history. Traditionally, this process is labor intensive,
susceptible to memory errors, and fraught with privacy concerns. With the
recent almost ubiquitous availability of smart phones, many people carry a tool
which can be utilized to quickly identify an infected individual's contacts
during an epidemic, such as the current 2019 novel Coronavirus crisis.
Unfortunately, the very same first-generation contact tracing tools have been
used to expand mass surveillance, limit individual freedoms and expose the most
private details about individuals. We seek to outline the different
technological approaches to mobile-phone based contact-tracing to date and
elaborate on the opportunities and the risks that these technologies pose to
individuals and societies. We describe advanced security enhancing approaches
that can mitigate these risks and describe trade-offs one must make when
developing and deploying any mass contact-tracing technology. With this paper,
our aim is to continue to grow the conversation regarding contact-tracing for
epidemic and pandemic containment and discuss opportunities to advance this
space. We invite feedback and discussion.

  Case Fatality Rate","The relative case fatality rates (CFRs) between groups and countries are key
measures of relative risk that guide policy decisions regarding scarce medical
resource allocation during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the middle of an
active outbreak when surveillance data is the primary source of information,
estimating these quantities involves compensating for competing biases in time
series of deaths, cases, and recoveries. These include time- and severity-
dependent reporting of cases as well as time lags in observed patient outcomes.
In the context of COVID-19 CFR estimation, we survey such biases and their
potential significance. Further, we analyze theoretically the effect of certain
biases, like preferential reporting of fatal cases, on naive estimators of CFR.
We provide a partially corrected estimator of these naive estimates that
accounts for time lag and imperfect reporting of deaths and recoveries. We show
that collection of randomized data by testing the contacts of infectious
individuals regardless of the presence of symptoms would mitigate bias by
limiting the covariance between diagnosis and death. Our analysis is

that concepts such as ""herd immunity"" and ""flattening the curve"" are highly
misleading in the context of this virus. Public policies based on these
concepts are inadequate to protect the population. Only reducing the R0 of the
virus below 1 is an effective strategy for maintaining the death burden of
COVID-19 within the normal range of seasonal flu. As R0 values estimated with
the model range from 2.82 worldwide outside of China and 3.83 in the Western

show that a policy based on joint confinement, targeted tests, and tracking

recognition technology ineffective in many cases, such as community access

performance of the existing face recognition technology on the masked faces.
Most current advanced face recognition approaches are designed based on deep
learning, which depend on a large number of face samples. However, at present,
there are no publicly available masked face recognition datasets. To this end,
this work proposes three types of masked face datasets, including Masked Face
Detection Dataset (MFDD), Real-world Masked Face Recognition Dataset (RMFRD)
and Simulated Masked Face Recognition Dataset (SMFRD). Among them, to the best
of our knowledge, RMFRD is currently theworld's largest real-world masked face
dataset. These datasets are freely available to industry and academia, based on
which various applications on masked faces can be developed. The
multi-granularity masked face recognition model we developed achieves 95%
accuracy, exceeding the results reported by the industry. Our datasets are

cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the
first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western
Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of
confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds,
dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results,
hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction
number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than
February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the
epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The
median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of
positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.
The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We
estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We
estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around

nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of
COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely
unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We
observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with
an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive
containment strategies are required to control COVID-19 spread and catastrophic
outcomes for the healthcare system.

January 2020, China imposed quarantine and isolation restrictions in Wuhan, a
city of more than 10 million people. This raised the question: is mass
quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its
scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using
a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show
that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down
the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t) > 1 to
R(t) <1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in
Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected
case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health
policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down
the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in
other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail
spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in
the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March
2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction
number at R(t) <1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures
in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent
increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) >1. Thus, it may be wise
to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which
maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.

  (1) Will the ICU capacity in Chicago be exceeded, and if so by how much?
  (2) Can strong mitigation strategies, such as lockdown or shelter in place
order, prevent the overflow of capacity?
  (3) When should such strategies be implemented?
  Our answers are as follows:
  (1) The ICU capacity may be exceeded by a large amount, probably by a factor
of ten.
  (2) Strong mitigation can avert this emergency situation potentially, but
even that will not work if implemented too late.
  (3) If the strong mitigation precedes April 1st, then the growth of COVID-19
can be controlled and the ICU capacity could be adequate. The earlier the
strong mitigation is implemented, the greater the probability that it will be
successful. After around April 1 2020, any strong mitigation will not avert the
emergency situation. In Italy, the lockdown occurred too late and the number of
deaths is still doubling every 2.3 days. It is difficult to be sure about the
precise dates for this window of opportunity, due to the inherent uncertainties
in computer simulation. But there is high confidence in the main conclusion
that it exists and will soon be closed.
  Our conclusion is that, being fully cognizant of the societal trade-offs,
there is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to avert a worst-case scenario
in Chicago, but only with strong mitigation/lockdown implemented in the next
week at the latest. If this window is missed, the epidemic will get worse and
then strong mitigation/lockdown will be required after all, but it will be too
late.

severe, potentially fatal respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) was identified in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and is causing outbreaks in multiple world
countries, soon becoming a pandemic. Italy has now become the most hit country
outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a
total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of
paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an
effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a
new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on
whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The
distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because
non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than
diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain
misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic
phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop
life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires
hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the
healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be
redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic
containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19
epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different

  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction","In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

  Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest X-Ray Images","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health
and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against
COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key
screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography.
Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research
community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural
network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray
(CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source
network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial
release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we
generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases,
with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the
best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes
predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain
deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can
aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible
and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on
relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready
solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the
description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged
and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to
accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning
solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who
need it the most.

to repeating waves of infection. We show -- as proof of concept grounded on
rigorous mathematical evidence -- that periodic, high-frequency alternation of
into, and out-of, lockdown effectively mitigates second-wave effects, while
allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i)
predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii)
robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements
over short time scales. In turn -- while not eliminating the virus -- this fast
switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until
a vaccine or treatment becomes available, while alleviating the social costs
associated with long lockdowns. Typically, the policy might be in the form of
1-day of work followed by 6-days of lockdown every week (or perhaps 2 days
working, 5 days off) and it can be modified at a slow-rate based on
measurements filtered over longer time scales. Our results highlight the
potential efficacy of high frequency switching interventions in post lockdown
mitigation. All code is available on Github

  SIR Model previously used in South Korea for the MERS outbreak","The new coronavirus covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the
World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. One of the
questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the
spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR
model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also
caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases
in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct
five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out
of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000
people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective
and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South
Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario
1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios
were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\%
effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the
transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario
active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission
rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of
cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$
was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about
~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting
measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the
recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate
measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully
that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.

disease among individuals both within and between regions. A set of regions can
be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact
within each region far exceeds that between them. COVID-19 can be eliminated if
the region-to-region reproductive number---i.e. the average number of other
regions to which a single infected region will transmit the virus---is reduced
to less than one. We find that this region-to-region reproductive number is
proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length
of the time-delay before region-level control measures are imposed. Thus,
reductions in travel and the speed with which regions take action play decisive
roles in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on
average, infected regions (including those that become re-infected in the
future) impose social distancing measures shortly after active spreading begins
within them, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in
which such measures are required, will exponentially decrease over time.
Elimination will in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social
distancing measures have been lifted from most of the regions.

We apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including
restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, home quarantine,
social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures.
School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits, unless coupled with
high level of social distancing compliance. We report several trade-offs, and
an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in
the range between 70% and 80% levels, with compliance at the 90% level found to
control the disease within 13--14 weeks, when coupled with effective case

all the data show a bias linked to the event of March 10th (day for which the

positive cases and deaths are calculated; - following the containment measures
of the Prime Minister's Decree of March 11th, the spread of the epidemic,

around 8000 to just over 6500 for March 27th.

spread of the coronavirus disease. Our model contains at most two fitting
parameters, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health
organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that
our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data,
which exhibits a cross-over from exponential to power-law growth, as lock-down
measures begin to take effect. Before these measures, our model predicts
exponential growth from day 30 to 69, starting from the date on which the world
health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$
day 1). Based on this initial data the disease may be expected to infect
approximately 23% of the global population, i.e. about 1.76 billion people,
taking approximately 83 million lives. Under this scenario, the global number
of new cases is predicted to peak on day 133 (about the middle of May 2020),
with an estimated 60 million new cases per day. If current lock-down measures
can be maintained, our model predicts power law growth from day 69 onward. Such
growth is comparatively slow and would have to continue for several decades
before a sufficient number of people (at least 23% of the global population)
have developed immunity to the disease through being infected. Lock-down
measures appear to be very effective in postponing the unimaginably large peak
in the daily number of new cases that would occur in the absence of any
interventions. However, should these measure be relaxed, the spread of the
disease will most likely revert back to its original exponential growth
pattern. As such, the duration and severity of the lock-down measures should be
carefully timed against their potentially devastating impact on the world
economy.

  peptide-based vaccines against COVID-19","Traditional vaccines against viruses are designed to target their surface
proteins, i.e., antigens, which can trigger the immune system to produce
specific antibodies to capture and neutralize the viruses. However, viruses
often evolve quickly, and their antigens are prone to mutations to avoid
recognition by the antibodies (antigenic drift). This limitation of the
antibody-mediated immunity could be addressed by the T-cell mediated immunity,
which is able to recognize conserved viral HLA peptides presented on
virus-infected cells. Thus, by targeting conserved regions on the genome of a
virus, T-cell epitope-based vaccines are less subjected to mutations and may
work effectively on different strains of the virus. Here we propose a
personalized workflow to identify an optimal set of T-cell epitopes based on
the HLA alleles and the immunopeptidome of an individual person. Specifically,
our workflow trains a machine learning model on the immunopeptidome and then
predicts HLA peptides from conserved regions of a virus that are most likely to
trigger responses from the person T cells. We applied the workflow to identify
T-cell epitopes for the SARS-COV-2 virus, which has caused the recent COVID-19
pandemic in more than 100 countries across the globe.

distances to track the relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis

discovered as a novel disease pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, China at the end
of 2019. Now, it becomes a Coronavirus outbreak around the world, the number of
infected people and deaths are increasing rapidly every day according to the
updated reports of the World Health Organization (WHO). Therefore, the aim of
this article is to introduce a new deep learning framework; namely COVIDX-Net
to assist radiologists to automatically diagnose COVID-19 in X-ray images.
Materials and Methods: Due to the lack of public COVID-19 datasets, the study
is validated on 50 Chest X-ray images with 25 confirmed positive COVID-19
cases. The COVIDX-Net includes seven different architectures of deep
convolutional neural network models, such as modified Visual Geometry Group
Network (VGG19) and the second version of Google MobileNet. Each deep neural
network model is able to analyze the normalized intensities of the X-ray image
to classify the patient status either negative or positive COVID-19 case.
Results: Experiments and evaluation of the COVIDX-Net have been successfully
done based on 80-20% of X-ray images for the model training and testing phases,
respectively. The VGG19 and Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet) models
showed a good and similar performance of automated COVID-19 classification with
f1-scores of 0.89 and 0.91 for normal and COVID-19, respectively. Conclusions:
This study demonstrated the useful application of deep learning models to
classify COVID-19 in X-ray images based on the proposed COVIDX-Net framework.
Clinical studies are the next milestone of this research work.

include risk assessment and diagnosis based on symptom histograms and their
development over time, as well as monitoring of spread, social distancing and
its effects, treatment and recovery, and patient wellbeing. We quickly guide
further through challenges that need to be faced for real-life usage. We come

community, with the timeline of control measures introduced in the state of New
York. We generate predictions, and assess the efficiency of these control
measures (closures, mobility restrictions, social distancing), in a
sustainability context.

  Bogota, Colombia?","During the last months, there is an increasing alarm about a new mutation of
coronavirus, covid-19 coined by World Health Organization(WHO) with an impact
in many areas: economy, health, politics and others. This situation was
declared a pandemic by WHO, because of the fast expansion over many countries.
At the same time, people is using Social Networks to express what they think,
feel or experiment, so this people are Social Sensors and helps to analyze what
is happening in their city. The objective of this paper is analyze the
publications of Colombian people living in Bogota with a radius of 50 km using
Text Mining techniques from symptomatology approach. The results support the
understanding of the spread in Colombia related to symptoms of covid19.

traditional Kalman filter. Poisson distributions are characteristic of
infectious diseases, which model the number of patients recorded as presenting
each day to a health care system. We develop both a linear and nonlinear
(extended) filter. The methods are applied to a case study of neonatal sepsis
and postinfectious hydrocephalus in Africa, using parameters estimated from
publicly available data. Our approach is applicable to a broad range of disease
dynamics, including both noncommunicable and the inherent nonlinearities of
communicable infectious diseases and epidemics such as from COVID-19.

  disease (COVID-19) and environmental factors based on study of four mostly
  affected places of China and five mostly affected places of Italy","COVID-19 is a new type of coronavirus disease which is caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It originated in China in the
month of December 2019 and quickly started to spread within the country. On
31st December 2019, it was first reported to country office of World Health
Organization (WHO) in China. Since then, it has spread to most of the countries
around the globe. However, there has been a recent rise in trend in believing
that it would go away during summer days, which has not yet been properly
investigated. In this paper, relationship of daily number of confirmed cases of
COVID-19 with three environmental factors, viz. maximum relative humidity
(RH_max), maximum temperature (T_max) and highest wind speed (WS_max),
considering the incubation period, have been investigated statistically, for
four of the most affected places of China, viz. Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai,
Wuhan and five of the most affected places of Italy, viz. Bergamo, Cremona,
Lodi, Milano. It has been found that the relationship with maximum relative
humidity and highest wind is mostly negligible, whereas relationship with
maximum temperature is ranging between negligible to moderate.

possibility to extend the analysis to other countries are discussed in the
conclusions.

Due to the importance of GUP at Planck scale, we investigate the Friedmann

implies a minimal length, we find a minimum apparent horizon which has a
potential to remove the Big Bang singularity. Furthermore, we analyse the
effects of DSR-GUP on deceleration parameter q for the equation of state p =

news in the last few months as it developed into a pandemic. In many
mathematics and physics classrooms, instructors are using the time series of
the number of cases to show exponential growth of the infection. In this
manuscript we propose a simple diffusion process as the mode of spreading
infections. This model is less sophisticated than other models in the
literature, but it can capture the exponential growth and it can explain it in
terms of mobility (diffusion constant), population density, and probability of
transmission. Students can change the parameters and determine the growth rate
and predict the total number of cases as a function of time. Students are also
given the opportunity to add other factors that are not considered in the
simple diffusion model.

  Related Trade-offs","Contact tracing is an essential tool for public health officials and local
communities to fight the spread of novel diseases, such as for the COVID-19
pandemic. The Singaporean government just released a mobile phone app,
TraceTogether, that is designed to assist health officials in tracking down
exposures after an infected individual is identified. However, there are
important privacy implications of the existence of such tracking apps. Here, we
analyze some of those implications and discuss ways of ameliorating the privacy
concerns without decreasing usefulness to public health. We hope in writing
this document to ensure that privacy is a central feature of conversations
surrounding mobile contact tracing apps and to encourage community efforts to
develop alternative effective solutions with stronger privacy protection for
the users. Importantly, though we discuss potential modifications, this
document is not meant as a formal research paper, but instead is a response to
some of the privacy characteristics of direct contact tracing apps like
TraceTogether and an early-stage Request for Comments to the community.

spreading. Here we describe a model that emerged from our analysis that was
focused on the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) and the possible routes linking
it to the viral infection. because the infection is mediated by the viral
receptor on human cell membranes Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE2), which is
a key component in RAS signalling. The model depicts the main pathways
determining the disease and the molecular framework for its establishment, and
can help to shed light on mechanisms involved in the infection. It promptly
gives an answer to some of the controversial, and still open, issues concerning
predisposing conditions and medical treatments that protect from or favour the
severity of the disease (such as the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs/sartans), or
to the sex related biases in the affected population. The model highlights
novel opportunities for further investigations, diagnosis and appropriate
intervention to understand and fight COVID19.

  CoVid-19","The CoVid-19 is spreading pandemically all over the world. A rapid defeat of
the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to
separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of
productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the
common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources,
is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be
examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of
potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad
slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality
rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of
Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate
sample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the
joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients
and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the
first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional
correlation case in function of the infection probability. The
multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered.
Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their
outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or
thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable.
Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular
international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is
growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the
better.

for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase
rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may
lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest
CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age
45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of
COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross
validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of
quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to
the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the
right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left
lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment
(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.
Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity
of COVID-19, were revealed.

  Anomaly Detection","Cluster of viral pneumonia occurrences during a short period of time may be a
harbinger of an outbreak or pandemic, like SARS, MERS, and recent COVID-19.
Rapid and accurate detection of viral pneumonia using chest X-ray can be
significantly useful in large-scale screening and epidemic prevention,
particularly when other chest imaging modalities are less available. Viral
pneumonia often have diverse causes and exhibit notably different visual
appearances on X-ray images. The evolution of viruses and the emergence of
novel mutated viruses further result in substantial dataset shift, which
greatly limits the performance of classification approaches. In this paper, we
formulate the task of differentiating viral pneumonia from non-viral pneumonia
and healthy controls into an one-class classification-based anomaly detection
problem, and thus propose the confidence-aware anomaly detection (CAAD) model,
which consists of a shared feature extractor, an anomaly detection module, and
a confidence prediction module. If the anomaly score produced by the anomaly
detection module is large enough or the confidence score estimated by the
confidence prediction module is small enough, we accept the input as an anomaly
case (i.e., viral pneumonia). The major advantage of our approach over binary
classification is that we avoid modeling individual viral pneumonia classes
explicitly and treat all known viral pneumonia cases as anomalies to reinforce
the one-class model. The proposed model outperforms binary classification
models on the clinical X-VIRAL dataset that contains 5,977 viral pneumonia (no
COVID-19) cases, 18,619 non-viral pneumonia cases, and 18,774 healthy controls.

have surfaced to deal with the possible shortage of ventilators upon
catastrophic surges of patients. One solution involves splitting one ventilator
to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are
obvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients
with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs
of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but
that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different
compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility
of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments
expanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different
ventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs
connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were
measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances,
modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found
discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional
with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway
resistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also
change the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume
controlled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP
settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test
lungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to
identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the
hazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for
mitigating risks.

exponential growth, with the number of cases quite well fit in time by
$N(t)\propto e^{\alpha t}$, in many countries. We analyze the rate $\alpha$ for
each country, starting from a threshold of 30 total cases and using the next 12
days, capturing thus the early growth homogeneously. We look for a link between
$\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of each country, in the month of the
epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed
the epidemic earlier, an {\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\it
extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently.
Applying a linear fit $\alpha(T)$, we find increasing evidence for a decreasing
$\alpha$ as a function of $T$, at $99.66\%$C.L., $99.86\%$C.L. and $99.99995
\%$ C.L. ($p$-value $5 \cdot 10^{-7}$, or 5$\sigma$ detection) in the {\it
base}, {\it intermediate} and {\it extended} dataset, respectively. The
doubling time is expected to increase by $40\%\sim 50\%$, going from $5^\circ$
C to $25^\circ$ C. In the {\it base} set, going beyond a linear model, a peak
at $(7.7\pm 3.6)^\circ C$ seems to be present, but its evidence disappears for
the larger datasets. We also analyzed a possible bias: poor countries, often
located in warm regions, might have less intense testing. By excluding
countries below a given GDP per capita, we find that our conclusions are only
slightly affected and only for the {\it extended} dataset. The significance
remains high, with a $p$-value of $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ or less. Our findings give
hope that, for northern hemisphere countries, the growth rate should
significantly decrease as a result of both warmer weather and lockdown
policies. In general the propagation should be hopefully stopped by strong
lockdown, testing and tracking policies, before the arrival of the cold season.

rates at the expense of negative economic effects. Market expectations
plummeted, foreshadowing the risk of a global economic crisis and mass

is key to identify the industries that are most in need of support. In this
study, we introduce a data-mining approach to measure industry-specific risks
related to COVID-19. We examine company risk reports filed to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This alternative data set can
complement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving

findings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business
risks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to
distinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on
natural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their
perceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are
summarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the
industry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through
the economy. The tracking tool is updated weekly. It could provide relevant
empirical data to inform models on the economic effects of the crisis. Such
complementary empirical information could ultimately help policymakers to
effectively target financial support in order to mitigate the economic shocks

Many drug therapy developments consist in investigating through different
clinical trials the effects of different specific drug combinations by
delivering it into a test group of ill patients, meanwhile a placebo treatment
is delivered to the remaining ill patients, known as the control group. We
compare the above technique to a new technique in which all patients receive a
different and reasonable combination of drugs and use this outcome to feed a
Neural Network. By averaging out fluctuations and recognizing different patient
features, the Neural Network learns the pattern that connects the patients
initial state to the outcome of the treatments and therefore can predict the
best drug therapy better than the above method. In contrast to many available
works, we do not study any detail of drugs composition nor interaction, but
instead pose and solve the problem from a phenomenological point of view, which
allows us to compare both methods. Although the conclusion is reached through
mathematical modeling and is stable upon any reasonable model, this is a
proof-of-concept that should be studied within other expertises before
confronting a real scenario. All calculations, tools and scripts have been made

spread in a given population is developed. It enables the identification of the
key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in
terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended
to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by
Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the
initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of
infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a
`retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the
effectiveness of the control policies adopted.
  The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python
code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They
substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and
adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing
individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as `social/physical
distancing' and population density reduction by strict quarantining are
essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the
pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection
rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart
the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available
available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to
determine the the key parameters of the model. Possible extensions to the basic
model to make it more realistic are indicated.

large number of individuals, both to determine the line of treatment as well as
to know the spread of infection to plan containment, mitigation and future
responses. However, the lack of adequate testing kits could be a bottleneck,
especially in the case of unanticipated new diseases, such as COVID-19, where
the testing technology, manufacturing capability, distribution, human skills
and laboratories might be unavailable or in short supply. In addition, the cost
of the standard PCR test is approximately USD 48, which is prohibitive for
poorer patients and most governments. We address this bottleneck by proposing a
test methodology that pools the sample from two (or more) patients in a single
test. The key insight is that a single negative result from a pooled sample
likely implies negative infection of all the individual patients. and It
thereby rules out further tests for the patients. This protocol, therefore,
requires significantly fewer tests. This may, however, result in somewhat
increased false negatives. Our simulations show that combining samples from two
patients with 7% underlying likelihood of infection implies that 36% fewer test
kits are required, with 14% additional units of time for testing.

Luxembourg will reach a peak number of SARS-CoV-2 infected people. The

differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify
potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a
systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

Here, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and
computed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We found that the 3 and 5 prime ends are
the most structured elements in the viral genome and the 5 prime end has the
strongest propensity to associate with human proteins. The domain encompassing
nucleotides 23000-24000 is highly conserved both at the sequence and structural
level, while the region upstream varies significantly. These two sequences code
for a domain of the viral protein Spike S that interacts with the human
receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and has the potential to bind
sialic acids. Our predictions indicate that the first 1000 nucleotides in the 5
prime end can interact with proteins involved in viral RNA processing such as
double-stranded RNA specific editases and ATP-dependent RNA-helicases, in
addition to other high-confidence candidate partners. These interactions,
previously reported to be also implicated in HIV, reveal important information
on host-virus interactions. The list of transcriptional and

  We propose an alternative: an extremely simple scheme for providing

can be deployed with very little infrastructure, and incurs a relatively low
false-positive rate compared to other collocation methods. We also describe a
number of extensions and tradeoffs.
  We believe that the privacy guarantees provided by the scheme will encourage
quick and broad voluntary adoption. When combined with sufficient testing
capacity and existing best practices from healthcare professionals, we hope
that this may significantly reduce the infection rate.

most viral and severe epidemic spread in the last twenty years, as compared to
Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003. Despite being still in the middle of the
outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19. The
objective is to clarify how it was spread so fast in a short time worldwide in
unprecedented fashion. This paper represents a first initiative to achieve this
goal, and it provides a comprehensive analytical study about the Coronavirus.
The contribution of this paper consists in providing descriptive and predictive
models that give insights into COVID-19 impact through the analysis of
extensive data updated daily for the outbreak in all countries. We aim at
answering several open questions: How does COVID-19 spread around the world?
What is its impact in terms of confirmed and death cases at the continent,
region, and country levels? How does its severity compare with other epidemic
outbreaks, including Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003? Is there a
correlation between the number of confirmed cases and death cases? We present a
comprehensive analytics visualization to address the questions mentioned above.

Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and
one based on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing
protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent,
analyze and design architectural features across length- and time-scales. We
further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct

binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly
influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development
of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through
melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other
applications of audible coding of matter include material design by
manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to
broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a
physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as

failure is the leading cause of death in COVID-19, brought by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there still lacks
efficient treatment for COVID-19 induced lung injury and acute respiratory
failure. Inhibition of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) caused by spike
protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the most plausible mechanism of lung injury in
COVID-19. We propose two candidate drugs, COL-3 (a chemically modified
tetracycline) and CGP-60474 (a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), for treating
lung injuries in COVID-19, based on their abilities to reverse the gene
expression patterns in HCC515 cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and in human
COVID-19 patient lung tissues. Further bioinformatics analysis shows that
twelve significantly enriched pathways (P-value <0.05) overlap between HCC515
cells treated with ACE2 inhibitor and human COVID-19 patient lung tissues,
including signaling pathways known to be associated with lung injury such as
TNF signaling, MAPK signaling and Chemokine signaling pathways. All these
twelve pathways are targeted in COL-3 treated HCC515 cells, in which genes such
as RHOA, RAC2, FAS, CDC42 have reduced expression. CGP-60474 shares eleven of
twelve pathways with COL-3 with common target genes such as RHOA. It also
uniquely targets genes related to lung injury, such as CALR and MMP14. In
summary, this study shows that ACE2 inhibition is likely part of the mechanisms
leading to lung injury in COVID-19, and that compounds such as COL-3 and
CGP-60474 have the potential as repurposed drugs for its treatment.

model, namely SEIR with Social Distancing (SEIR--SD), extended here through the
definition of a social distancing function varying over time, to assess the
situation related to the spreading of the coronavirus Covid--19 in Italy and in
two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. To profitably
use this model, the most suitable values of its parameters must be found. The
estimation of the SEIR--SD model parameters takes place here through the use of
Differential Evolution, a heuristic optimization technique. In this way, we are
able to evaluate for each of the three above-mentioned scenarios the daily
number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading, the
day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, and the day in which
the infected cases will become very close to zero.

significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world
scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby
precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in
order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic.
Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed
at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or
attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes
are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this
approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of
the giant component $P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree
distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$ we recover prior work on
targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.
Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases
quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with
complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between
$|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha
n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2<\gamma<3$, we
find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from
$n=1$ to order of $\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks,
knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce
dramatically an epidemics.

abnormal CT patterns commonly present in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
namely ground glass opacities and consolidations. Materials and Methods: In
this retrospective study, the proposed method takes as input a non-contrasted
chest CT and segments the lesions, lungs, and lobes in three dimensions, based
on a dataset of 9749 chest CT volumes. The method outputs two combined measures
of the severity of lung and lobe involvement, quantifying both the extent of
COVID-19 abnormalities and presence of high opacities, based on deep learning
and deep reinforcement learning. The first measure of (PO, PHO) is global,
while the second of (LSS, LHOS) is lobewise. Evaluation of the algorithm is
reported on CTs of 200 participants (100 COVID-19 confirmed patients and 100
healthy controls) from institutions from Canada, Europe and the United States
collected between 2002-Present (April, 2020). Ground truth is established by
manual annotations of lesions, lungs, and lobes. Correlation and regression
analyses were performed to compare the prediction to the ground truth. Results:
Pearson correlation coefficient between method prediction and ground truth for
COVID-19 cases was calculated as 0.92 for PO (P < .001), 0.97 for PHO(P <
.001), 0.91 for LSS (P < .001), 0.90 for LHOS (P < .001). 98 of 100 healthy
controls had a predicted PO of less than 1%, 2 had between 1-2%. Automated
processing time to compute the severity scores was 10 seconds per case compared
to 30 minutes required for manual annotations. Conclusion: A new method
segments regions of CT abnormalities associated with COVID-19 and computes (PO,
PHO), as well as (LSS, LHOS) severity scores.

of social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions and lock-downs. Such
measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain for
extended periods. As an alternative, we propose here an alternating quarantine
strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under
lock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of
weekly succession between activity and quarantine. This regime affords a dual
partition:\ half of the population interacts for only half of the time,
resulting in a dramatic reduction in transmission, comparable to that achieved
by a population-wide lock-down. All the while, it enables socioeconomic
continuity at $50\%$ capacity. The proposed weekly alternations also address an
additional challenge, with specific relevance to COVID-19. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2
exhibits a relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience
no symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. Unable to selectively
isolate these invisible spreaders, we resort to population-wide restrictions.
However, under the alternating quarantine routine, if an individual was exposed
during their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will,
in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the
majority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leading
to a rapid decline in the viral spread, thus addressing one of the main
challenges in COVID-19 mitigation.

  public transport system","The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines
the importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public
transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for
infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns
and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus
critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For
instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent
in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions
such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider
multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for
the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide
smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus
passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the
distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate
disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We
investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while
varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our
results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions
simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different
groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single
dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given
specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination
efforts.

budget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and
detecting new cases early on.
  In this report, we consider the problem of allocating test-kits and discuss
some solution approaches. We believe that these approaches will be useful to
contain community spread and detect new cases early on. Additionally, these
approaches would help in collecting unbiased data which can then be used to
improve the accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict COVID-19
infections.

total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission.
However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for
France). By setting the end of intervention as the day when hospital capacity
is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up
to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results
pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after

of the greatest challenges mankind face in this generation. Computational
simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the
current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future
projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control
action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a
well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral
diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola,
SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with
additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibility,
where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the
current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death,
recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also
considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time
delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as
well as resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge
variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims
to reflect better on the current scenario and case data reported, such that the
spread of the disease and the efficiency of the control action taken can be
better understood. The model is verified using two case studies for
verification and prediction studies, based on the real-world data in South
Korea and Northern Ireland, respectively.

of these studies showed that the mutations in the SARS-CoV-1 Spike protein

In this work, we used molecular dynamics simulations and Monte Carlo sampling
to compare the binding affinities of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 stronger
than SARS-CoV by 7 kcal/mol, due to enhanced electrostatic interactions. The
major contributions to the electrostatic binding energies are resulting from
the salt-bridges formed between R426 and ACE2-E329 in case of SARS-CoV and K417
and ACE2-D30 for SARS-CoV2. In addition, there is no significant contribution
from a single mutant to the binding energies. However, these mutations induce
sophisticated structural changes that enhance the binding energies. Our results
also indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely a lab engineered virus.

  epidemic","One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is
to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control
its timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic
dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only
at the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire
time-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the
equations for the SIR dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in
the time domain and to derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale
and the speed of the epidemics, by reducing the infection rate $\alpha$ and by
increasing the removal rate $\beta$ by a factor of $\lambda$. We show that for
a given value of the size ($I_P$, the total, $I_E$ and average $\hat I_P$
number of infected), its occurrence time $t_P$ and entire time-span $t_E$ can
be reduced by a factor $1/\lambda$ if the reduction of $I$ is achieved by
increasing the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus,
epidemic containment measures based on tracing, early detection followed by
prompt isolation of infected individuals are more efficient than those based on
social distancing. We apply our results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern
Italy. We show that the peak time $t_P$ and the entire time span $t_E$ could
have been reduced by a factor $0.9 \le 1/\lambda\le 0.34$ with containment
measures focused on increasing $\beta$ instead of reducing $\alpha$.

COVID-19, whereas the recently emerging artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies further strengthen the power of the imaging tools and help medical
specialists. We hereby review the rapid responses in the community of medical
imaging (empowered by AI) toward COVID-19. For example, AI-empowered image
acquisition can significantly help automate the scanning procedure and also
reshape the workflow with minimal contact to patients, providing the best
protection to the imaging technicians. Also, AI can improve work efficiency by
accurate delination of infections in X-ray and CT images, facilitating
subsequent quantification. Moreover, the computer-aided platforms help
radiologists make clinical decisions, i.e., for disease diagnosis, tracking,
and prognosis. In this review paper, we thus cover the entire pipeline of
medical imaging and analysis techniques involved with COVID-19, including image
acquisition, segmentation, diagnosis, and follow-up. We particularly focus on
the integration of AI with X-ray and CT, both of which are widely used in the

  Covid-19 spread","Since the first recording of what we now call Covid-19 infection in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China on Dec 31, 2019, the disease has spread worldwide and met
with a wide variety of social distancing and quarantine policies. The
effectiveness of these responses is notoriously difficult to quantify as
individuals travel, violate policies deliberately or inadvertently, and infect
others without themselves being detected. In this paper, we attempt to
interpret and extrapolate from publicly available data using a mixed
first-principles epidemiological equations and data-driven neural network
model. Leveraging our neural network augmented model, we focus our analysis on
four locales: Wuhan, Italy, South Korea and the United States of America, and
compare the role played by the quarantine and isolation measures in each of
these countries in controlling the effective reproduction number $R_{t}$ of the
virus. Our results unequivocally indicate that the countries in which rapid
government interventions and strict public health measures for quarantine and
isolation were implemented were successful in halting the spread of infection
and prevent it from exploding exponentially. We test the predictive ability of
our model by matching predictions in the duration 3 March - 1 April 2020 for
Wuhan and in the duration 25 March - 1 April 2020 for Italy and South Korea. In
the case of the US, our model captures well the current infected curve growth
and predicts a halting of infection spread by 20 April 2020. We further
demonstrate that relaxing or reversing quarantine measures right now will lead
to an exponential explosion in the infected case count, thus nullifying the
role played by all measures implemented in the US since mid March 2020.

epidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous
random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different
types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.
An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on
day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social
behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability
distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is
given for the basic SI (""susceptible-infective"") network contagion model, which
focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main
result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of
the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves
only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network
models, including ""removed"" (R) and ""exposed"" (E) classes, are formulated.
These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for
the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of
different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social
distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an
algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a
number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as
the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent
based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic
modelling.

  in order to stop the spread of COVID-19","Currently there are many attempts around the world to use computers,
smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices in order to stop the spread
of COVID-19. Most of these attempts focus on collecting information about
infected people, in order to help healthy people avoid contact with them.
However, social distancing decisions are still taken by the governments
empirically. That is, the authorities do not have an automated tool to
recommend which decisions to make in order to maximize social distancing and to
minimize the impact for the economy. In this paper we address the
aforementioned problem and we design an algorithm that provides social
distancing methods (i.e., what schools, shops, factories, etc. to close) that
are efficient (i.e., that help reduce the spread of the virus) and have low
impact on the economy. On short: a) we propose several models (i.e.,
combinatorial optimization problems); b) we show some theoretical results
regarding the computational complexity of the formulated problems; c) we give

  among COVID-19 cases in Germany: evidence of lesser adherence to social
  distancing practices?","Background: There is uncertainty about the role of different age groups in
propagating the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in different countries. Methods: We used
the Koch Institute data on COVID-19 cases in Germany. To minimize the effect of
changes in healthcare seeking behavior and testing practices, we included the
following 5-year age groups in the analyses: 10-14y through 45-49y. For each
age group g, we considered the proportion PL(g) of individuals in age group g
among all detected cases aged 10-49y during weeks 13-14, 2020 (later period),
as well as corresponding proportion PE(g) for weeks 10-11, 2020 (early period),
and the relative risk RR(g)=PL(g)/PE(g). For each pair of age groups g1,g2, a
higher value of RR(g1) compared to RR(g2) is interpreted as the relative
increase in the population incidence of SARS-Cov-2 for g1 compared to g2 for
the later vs. early period. Results: The relative risk was highest for
individuals aged 20-24y (RR=1.4(95% CI (1.27,1.55))), followed by individuals
aged 15-19y (RR=1.14(0.99,1.32)), aged 30-34y (RR= 1.07(0.99,1.16)), aged
25-29y (RR= 1.06(0.98,1.15)), aged 35-39y (RR=0.95(0.87,1.03)), aged 40-44y
(RR=0.9(0.83,0.98)), aged 45-49y (RR=0.83(0.77,0.89)) and aged 10-14y
(RR=0.78(0.64,0.95)). Conclusions: The observed relative increase with time in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y)
among COVID-19 cases is unlikely to be explained by increases in the likelihood
of seeking medical care/being tested for individuals in those age groups
compared to individuals aged 35-49y or 10-14y, suggesting an actual increase in
the prevalence of individuals aged 15-34y among SARS-CoV-2 infections in the
German population. That increase likely reflects elevated mixing among
individuals aged 15-34y (particularly those aged 20-24y) compared to other age
groups, possibly due to lesser adherence to social distancing practices.

  on Influenza-Like Illness and COVID-19","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory
disease that was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since
spread around the globe, claiming more than 69,000 lives by the time this
protocol is written. It has been widely acknowledged that the most effective
public policy to mitigate the pandemic is \emph{social and physical
distancing}: keeping at least six feet away from people, working from home,
closing non-essential businesses, etc. There have been a lot of anecdotal
evidences suggesting that social distancing has a causal effect on disease
mitigation; however, few studies have investigated the effect of social
distancing on disease mitigation in a transparent and statistically-sound
manner.
  We propose to perform an optimal non-bipartite matching to pair counties with
similar observed covariates but vastly different average social distancing
scores during the first week (March 16th through Match 22nd) of President's
\emph{15 Days to Slow the Spread} campaign. We have produced a total of $302$
pairs of two U.S. counties with good covariate balance on a total of $16$
important variables. Our primary outcome will be the average observed illness
collected by Kinsa Inc. two weeks after the intervention period. Although the
observed illness does not directly measure COVID-19, it reflects a real-time
aspect of the pandemic, and unlike confirmed cases, it is much less confounded
by counties' testing capabilities. We also consider observed illness three
weeks after the intervention period as a secondary outcome. We will test a
proportional treatment effect using a randomization-based test with covariance
adjustment and conduct a sensitivity analysis.

geographic distance to the hotspots as well as the population density and
demographics of the regions. As the pandemic progressed in the U.S., a county's
social proximity to recent COVID-19 cases and deaths predicts future outbreaks
over and above physical proximity and demographics. In part due to its broad
coverage, social connectedness data provides additional predictive power to
measures based on smartphone location or online search data. These results
suggest that data from online social networks can be useful to epidemiologists
and others hoping to forecast the spread of communicable diseases such as
COVID-19.

  provide a rationale behind the lockdown","Background: Restrictive mass quarantine or lockdown has been implemented as
the most important controlling measure to fight against COVID-19. Many
countries have enforced 2 - 4 weeks' lockdown and are extending the period
depending on their current disease scenario. Most probably the 14-day period of
estimated communicability of COVID-19 prompted such decision. But the idea
that, if the susceptible population drops below certain threshold, the
infection would naturally die out in small communities after a fixed time
(following the outbreak), unless the disease is reintroduced from outside, was
proposed by Bartlett in 1957. This threshold was termed as Critical Community
Size (CCS). Methods: We propose an SEIR model that explains COVID-19 disease
dynamics. Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to
extinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of
lockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the
given country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have
identified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops
below CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it
is introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We
have calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown
days. Thus, smaller lockdown phase is sufficient to contain COVID-19. On a
cautionary note, our model indicates another rise in infection almost a year
later but on a lesser magnitude.

recommendations and ad campaigns for improved hygiene practices, enacting
social distancing requirements and limiting large public gatherings, and
stay-at-home orders and lockdowns. In the United States, while the response has
varied greatly from state to state, we clearly see that the effect of these
public safety measures is significant and, if these measures continue to remain
in effect, or are expanded to a nationwide lockdown, the pandemic can be
controlled and the disease likely overcome with mitigated consequences. In this
paper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We
find that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according
to this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the
total number of deaths to ~72 thousand. A 60 day lockdown can save countless
lives.

  general public to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic","Face mask use by the general public for limiting the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic is controversial, though increasingly recommended, and the potential
of this intervention is not well understood. We develop a compartmental model
for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general,
asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious.
Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of
New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively
ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of
COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use
decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the
product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts
blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the
impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear,
indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Masks
are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy
persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption
scenarios suggest that immediate near universal (80%) adoption of moderately
(50%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17--45% of projected deaths
over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by
34--58%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Our results suggest use of
face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing
community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide
benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with
other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when
adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.

  phases of the disease","One major bottleneck in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the limited number
of critical care beds. Due to the dynamic development of infections and the
time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them
enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can
easily be underestimated. To infer future ICU load from reported infections, we
suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2)
allows for making predictions depending on different future growth of
infections. We have evaluated our model for three regions, namely Berlin
(Germany), Lombardy (Italy), and Madrid (Spain). Before extensive containment
measures made an impact, we first estimate the region-specific model
parameters. Whereas for Berlin, an ICU rate of 6%, a time lag of 6 days, and an
average stay of 12 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data, for Lombardy
and Madrid the ICU rate was higher (18% and 15%) and the time lag (0 and 3
days) and the average stay (4 and 8 days) in ICU shorter. The region-specific
models are then used to predict future ICU load assuming either a continued
exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%) or linear growth. Thus, the
model can help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our
predictions are based on small data sets and disregard non-stationary dynamics,
our model is simple, robust, and can be used in early phases of the disease
when data are scarce.

  Cases at the Era of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with first
symptoms similar to the flu. COVID-19 appeared first in China and very quickly
spreads to the rest of the world, causing then the 2019-20 coronavirus
pandemic. In many cases, this disease causes pneumonia. Since pulmonary
infections can be observed through radiography images, this paper investigates
deep learning methods for automatically analyzing query chest X-ray images with
the hope to bring precision tools to health professionals towards screening the
COVID-19 and diagnosing confirmed patients. In this context, training datasets,
deep learning architectures and analysis strategies have been experimented from
publicly open sets of chest X-ray images. Tailored deep learning models are
proposed to detect pneumonia infection cases, notably viral cases. It is
assumed that viral pneumonia cases detected during an epidemic COVID-19 context
have a high probability to presume COVID-19 infections. Moreover, easy-to-apply
health indicators are proposed for estimating infection status and predicting
patient status from the detected pneumonia cases. Experimental results show
possibilities of training deep learning models over publicly open sets of chest
X-ray images towards screening viral pneumonia. Chest X-ray test images of
COVID-19 infected patients are successfully diagnosed through detection models
retained for their performances. The efficiency of proposed health indicators
is highlighted through simulated scenarios of patients presenting infections
and health problems by combining real and synthetic health data.

incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, Govt. has implemented a
nationwide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 transmission in India. To study the
effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on
COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data
on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated
several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic
reproduction number ($R_{0}$). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model
with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the
six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global
sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two
epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on
$R_{0}$. Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations
where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population.
Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce
community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the
COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days.
Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number ($R_{t}$) during
the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed
after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those
locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown
policy to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.

innovations from complex epidemiological models, AI, to open data platforms for

new relationships, and are likely to face intellectual property (IP) related
challenges. This paper adopts an IP perspective on the COVID-19 pandemic to
identify pandemic related IP considerations and IP challenges. The focus is on
challenges related to research, development and urgent upscaling of capacity to

challenges: (i) governments, (ii) organisations owning existing Crisis-Critical
IP, described as incumbents in Crisis-Critical Sectors (CC-Sectors), (iii)
manufacturing firms from other sectors normally not producing CC-Products
suddenly rushing into CC-Sectors to support the manufacturing of CC-Products
(new entrants), and (iv) voluntary grassroot initiatives that are formed during

  Behavior on Web Communities in the Face of COVID-19","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives in unprecedented
ways. In the face of the projected catastrophic consequences, many countries
have enacted social distancing measures in an attempt to limit the spread of
the virus. Under these conditions, the Web has become an indispensable medium
for information acquisition, communication, and entertainment. At the same
time, unfortunately, the Web is being exploited for the dissemination of
potentially harmful and disturbing content, such as the spread of conspiracy
theories and hateful speech towards specific ethnic groups, in particular
towards Chinese people since COVID-19 is believed to have originated from
China.
  In this paper, we make a first attempt to study the emergence of Sinophobic
behavior on the Web during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We collect
two large-scale datasets from Twitter and 4chan's Politically Incorrect board
(/pol/) over a time period of approximately five months and analyze them to
investigate whether there is a rise or important differences with regard to the
dissemination of Sinophobic content. We find that COVID-19 indeed drives the
rise of Sinophobia on the Web and that the dissemination of Sinophobic content
is a cross-platform phenomenon: it exists on fringe Web communities like
\dspol, and to a lesser extent on mainstream ones like Twitter. Also, using
word embeddings over time, we characterize the evolution and emergence of new
Sinophobic slurs on both Twitter and /pol/. Finally, we find interesting
differences in the context in which words related to Chinese people are used on
the Web before and after the COVID-19 outbreak: on Twitter we observe a shift
towards blaming China for the situation, while on /pol/ we find a shift towards
using more (and new) Sinophobic slurs.

by fitting the parameters of a compartmental model to empirical data, and
running the model forward with modified parameters that account for a specific
measure. This approach has several drawbacks, stemming from biases or lack of
availability of data and instability of parameter estimates. Here we take the
opposite approach -- that we call reverse epidemiology. Given the data, we
reconstruct backward in time an ensemble of networks of contacts, and we assess
the impact of measures on that specific realization of the contagion process.
This approach is robust because it only depends on parameters that describe the
evolution of the disease within one individual (e.g. latency time) and not on
parameters that describe the spread of the epidemics in a population. Using
this method, we assess the impact of preventive quarantine on the ongoing
outbreak of Covid-19 in Italy. This gives an estimate of how many infected
could have been avoided had preventive quarantine been enforced at a given
time.

  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by
various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2
causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social
distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this
end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized
(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and
analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous
complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is
necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is
insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with
the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy
at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees
to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that
stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the
outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for
the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus
reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find
that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the
adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a
region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an
understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our
investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into
understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak
infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to
understand and control over an extended period of time.

able to approximate the emotional responses of participants from text within

dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social

what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages

procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal
ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological
populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the

interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear
effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.

hand, searches for information regarding community level policies (e.g.,

  Epidemics","We develop a minimalist compartmental model to study the impact of mobility
restrictions in Italy during the Covid-19 outbreak. We show that an early
lockdown shifts the epidemic in time, while that beyond a critical value of the
lockdown strength, the epidemic tend to restart after lifting the restrictions.
As a consequence, specific mitigation strategies must be introduced. We
characterize the relative importance of different broad strategies by
accounting for two fundamental sources of heterogeneity, i.e. geography and
demography. First, we consider Italian regions as separate administrative
entities, in which social interactions between age classs occur. Due to the
sparsity of the inter-regional mobility matrix, once started the epidemics tend
to develop independently across areas, justifying the adoption of solutions
specific to individual regions or to clusters of regions. Second, we show that
social contacts between age classes play a fundamental role and that measures
which take into account the age structure of the population can provide a
significant contribution to mitigate the rebound effects. Our model is general,
and while it does not analyze specific mitigation strategies, it highlights the
relevance of some key parameters on non-pharmaceutical mitigation mechanisms
for the epidemics.

random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the
COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable
controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare
system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes
will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow
informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with
much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time
assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates.
  Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous
population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested
people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current
fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to
real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still
higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in
spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in
place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is
still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of
restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is
demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where
the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.

infections for each day is a tool for the definition and early detection of the
turning point of the epidemic. In Italy, the growth of Covid-19 activity was
overcome one week ago, Austria and Switzerland followed suit. This note
emphasizes the crucial delay of two weeks between infection and listing of
infection in a central database. Our estimates of the time course of Covid-19
activity and reproduction rates can reduce the information gap by several days.
We show that Spain and Germany are already beyond the turning point. In general
the estimated reproduction rates become undercritical a short time after the
main lockdown measures, and the Covid-19 activity starts to decrease
afterwards. This note gives a very optimistic outlook for all regions which
have taken strict containment measures.

  epidemic outbreak in Portugal","Background: The analysis of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic is of paramount
importance to understand the dynamics of the coronavirus spread. This can help
health and government authorities take the appropriate measures and implement
suitable politics aimed at fighting and preventing it. Methods: A
time-dependent dynamic SEIR model inspired in a model previously used during
the MERS outbreak in South Korea was used to analyse the time trajectories of
active and hospitalized cases in Portugal. Results: The time evolution of the
virus spread in the country was adequately modelled. The model has changeable
parameters every five days since the onset of mitigation measures. A peak of
about 22,000 active cases is estimated, although the official value for
recovered cases is out of date. Hospitalized cases could reach a peak of about
1,250 cases, of which 200/300 in ICU units. Conclusion: With appropriate
measures, the number of active cases in Portugal can be controlled at about
22,000 people, of which about 1,250 hospitalized and 200/300 in ICU units. This
seems manageable by the country national health service with an estimated 1,140
ventilators.

the spread of the disease and the demand on the healthcare infrastructure. The
seclusion of groups and individuals has led to limited access to accurate

are made by the minister of health daily. These announcements narrate the
confirmed COVID-19 cases and include the age, gender, and travel history of
people who have tested positive for the disease. Additionally, the South
African National Institute for Communicable Diseases updates a daily
infographic summarising the number of tests performed, confirmed cases,

other nuanced data regarding the transmission is only shared in the daily

function of strengthening SARS-CoV-2 infection in the gut. The study may
provide important clues for the mechisms of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

  The novel Coronavirus also called COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in
December 2019 and has now spread across the world. It has so far infected
around 1.8 million people and claimed approximately 114,698 lives overall. As
the number of cases are rapidly increasing, most of the countries are facing
shortage of testing kits and resources. The limited quantity of testing kits
and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep
Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting COVID-19
cases using chest X-rays.
  Methods
  In this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model
to automatically detect COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The
proposed model is based on Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet
dataset and trained end-to-end on a dataset prepared by collecting COVID-19 and
other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available
databases.
  Results and Conclusion
  CoroNet has been trained and tested on the prepared dataset and the
experimental results show that our proposed model achieved an overall accuracy
of 89.6%, and more importantly the precision and recall rate for COVID-19 cases
are 93% and 98.2% for 4-class cases (COVID vs Pneumonia bacterial vs pneumonia
viral vs normal). For 3-class classification (COVID vs Pneumonia vs normal),
the proposed model produced a classification accuracy of 95%. The preliminary
results of this study look promising which can be further improved as more
training data becomes available. Overall, the proposed model substantially
advances the current radiology based methodology and during COVID-19 pandemic,
it can be very helpful tool for clinical practitioners and radiologists to aid
them in diagnosis, quantification and follow-up of COVID-19 cases.

analyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell,
8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm
for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein
cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes
involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2,
BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst
including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are
co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the
trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for
proteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We
identified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are
enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are
common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid
metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
Together our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive
to coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they
also express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and
replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient
management for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  will help COVID-19 containment","The rapid dynamics of COVID-19 calls for quick and effective tracking of
virus transmission chains and early detection of outbreaks, especially in the
phase 2 of the pandemic, when lockdown and other restriction measures are
progressively withdrawn, in order to avoid or minimize contagion resurgence.
For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale
adoption by many countries. A centralized approach, where data sensed by the
app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens'
privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the
need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. We
advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both
contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens'
""personal data stores"", to be shared separately and selectively, voluntarily,
only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy
preserving level of granularity. This approach better protects the personal
sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed
information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and,
in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak
hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. Our recommendation is
two-fold. First to extend existing decentralized architectures with a light
touch, in order to manage the collection of location data locally on the
device, and allow the user to share spatio-temporal aggregates - if and when
they want, for specific aims - with health authorities, for instance. Second,
we favour a longer-term pursuit of realizing a Personal Data Store vision,
giving users the opportunity to contribute to collective good in the measure
they want, enhancing self-awareness, and cultivating collective efforts for
rebuilding society.

spread to multiple countries and infected thousands of people. Such diseases
spread mainly through person-to-person contacts. Health care authorities
recommend contact tracing procedures to prevent the spread to a vast
population. Although several mobile applications have been developed to trace
contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information
such as GPS locations, and the logging of privacy-sensitive data on a third
party server, or require additional infrastructure such as WiFi APs with known
locations. In this paper, we introduce CONTAIN, a privacy-oriented mobile
contact tracing application that does not rely on GPS or any other form of
infrastructure-based location sensing, nor the continuous logging of any other
personally identifiable information on a server. The goal of CONTAIN is to
allow users to determine with complete privacy if they have been within a short
distance, specifically, Bluetooth wireless range, of someone that is infected,
and potentially also when. We identify and prove the privacy guarantees
provided by our approach. Our simulation study utilizing an empirical trace
dataset (Asturies) involving 100 mobile devices and around 60000 records shows
that users can maximize their possibility of identifying if they were near an
infected user by turning on the app during active times.

  For droplet sizes larger than $100\,\mu m$, computing the time of decay to

  Patterns Detection in X-ray Images","Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, is nowadays one of the most prominent
challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus
propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The
standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to
the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening
methods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing
promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these
methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and
availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet
efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of
COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective
we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural
networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other
applications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a
hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed
approaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the
three classes were used to assess the quality of the methods. Results: The
results show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality
model, with an overall accuracy of 93.9%, COVID-19, sensitivity of 96.8% and
positive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters
than other than the other tested architectures. Larger and more heterogeneous
databases are still needed for validation before claiming that deep learning
can assist physicians in the task of detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images.

worldwide. We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out
jointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative
case-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only demands
collecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the
tested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with
population controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population
controls for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that
test-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population
controls. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic
persons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory
infections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal
magnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be
identified by the TND. Therefore, we discuss how to add population controls to
compare with the test-positives and the test-negatives, yielding two additional
case-control studies. We describe two options for population control groups:
one composed of accompanying persons to the test facilities, the other drawn
from existing country-wide health care databases. We also describe other
possibilities for population controls. Combining the TND with population
controls yields a triangulation approach that distinguishes between exposures
that are risk factors for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, and
exposures that are risk factors for just COVID-19. This combined design can be
applied to future epidemics, but also to study causes of non-epidemic disease.

significant socioeconomic cost. In this work, we introduce a novel

estimating the model parameters and hidden states from data, and an optimal
control strategy for sequencing social distancing and testing events such that
the number of infections is minimized. The analysis of our extensive
computational efforts reveals that social distancing and quarantining are most
effective when implemented early, with quarantining of confirmed infected
subjects having a much higher impact. Further, we find that ""on-off"" policies
alternating between strict social distancing and relaxing such restrictions can
be effective at ""flattening"" the curve while likely minimizing social and
economic cost.

we investigate the efficiency of group testing using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) for COVID-19. Group testing is a method in which multiple samples are
pooled together in groups and fewer tests are performed on these groups to
discern all the infected samples. We study the effect of dilution due to
pooling in group testing and show that group tests can perform well even in the
presence of dilution effects. We present multiple group testing algorithms that
could reduce the number of tests performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze
the efficiency of these tests and provide insights on their practical
relevance. With the use of algorithms described here, test plans can be
developed that can enable testing centers to increase the number of diagnosis
performed without increasing the number of PCR tests. The codes for generating

online media coverage about COVID-19-related racial attacks increases steadily,
most of which are anti-Chinese or anti-Asian. As this pandemic becomes
increasingly severe, more people start to talk about it on social media

Greek COVID-19 infection-curve in relation to the anti-COVID-19 policies
applied to control the pandemic. Based on the ongoing spreading of COVID-19 and
the insufficient data for applying classic time-series approaches, the analysis
builds on the visibility graph algorithm to study the Greek COVID-19
infection-curve as a complex network. By using the modularity optimization
algorithm, the generated visibility graph is divided into communities defining
periods of different connectivity in the time-series body. These periods reveal
a sequence of different typologies in the evolution of the disease, starting
with a power pattern, where a second order polynomial (U-shaped) pattern
intermediates, being followed by a couple of exponential patterns, and ending
up with a current logarithmic pattern revealing that the evolution of the Greek
COVID-19 infection-curve tends into saturation. The network analysis also
illustrates stability of hubs and instability of medium and low-degree nodes,
implying a low probability to meet maximum (infection) values at the future and
high uncertainty in the variability of other values below the average. The
overall approach contributes to the scientific research by proposing a novel
method for the structural decomposition of a time-series into periods, which
allows removing from the series the disconnected past-data facilitating better
forecasting, and provides insights of good policy and decision-making practices
and management that may help other countries improve their performance in the

  Classification from CT Images","An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded
in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic
around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also
be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in
Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness
may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and
progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden
standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.
Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources
may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such
circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis
and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly
supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of
manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection
detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the
promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a
wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.

shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic

jeopardise 24% of jobs and reduce total wage income by 17%. At the industry
level, sectors such as transport are likely to have output constrained by
demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining and services are
more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants and
tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show
that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply and
demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We
should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks -- we expect them
to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.

large-scale epidemic, early detection and isolation of potential virus carriers
is essential to curb the spread of the epidemic. Recent studies have shown that
one important feature of COVID-19 is the abnormal respiratory status caused by
viral infections. During the epidemic, many people tend to wear masks to reduce
the risk of getting sick. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a portable
non-contact method to screen the health condition of people wearing masks
through analysis of the respiratory characteristics. The device mainly consists
of a FLIR one thermal camera and an Android phone. This may help identify those
potential patients of COVID-19 under practical scenarios such as pre-inspection
in schools and hospitals. In this work, we perform the health screening through
the combination of the RGB and thermal videos obtained from the dual-mode
camera and deep learning architecture.We first accomplish a respiratory data
capture technique for people wearing masks by using face recognition. Then, a
bidirectional GRU neural network with attention mechanism is applied to the
respiratory data to obtain the health screening result. The results of
validation experiments show that our model can identify the health status on
respiratory with the accuracy of 83.7\% on the real-world dataset. The abnormal
respiratory data and part of normal respiratory data are collected from Ruijin
Hospital Affiliated to The Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School. Other

  Twitter","Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against
a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are
besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related
terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and
diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of
war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also
in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present
an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets
posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first
analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show
that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus
treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the
population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to
three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal
frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal
frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR
is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.
However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around
many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line
with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,
may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the
Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in
the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current
pandemic.

  in a post-lockdown world","Social distancing and isolation have been introduced widely to counter the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, more moderate contact reduction policies become
desirable owing to adverse social, psychological, and economic consequences of
a complete or near-complete lockdown. Adopting a social network approach, we
evaluate the effectiveness of three targeted distancing strategies designed to
'keep the curve flat' and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are
limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts, seeking similarity across
contacts, and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate
stochastic infection curves that incorporate core elements from infection
models, ideal-type social network models, and statistical relational event
models. We demonstrate that strategic reduction of contact can strongly
increase the efficiency of social distancing measures, introducing the
possibility of allowing some social contact while keeping risks low. This
approach provides nuanced insights to policy makers for effective social
distancing that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.

  and Segmentation","Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a pandemic
disease in over 200 countries, influencing billions of humans. To control the
infection, identifying and separating the infected people is the most crucial
step. The main diagnostic tool is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Still, the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test is not high
enough to effectively prevent the pandemic. The chest CT scan test provides a
valuable complementary tool to the RT-PCR test, and it can identify the
patients in the early-stage with high sensitivity. However, the chest CT scan
test is usually time-consuming, requiring about 21.5 minutes per case. This
paper develops a novel Joint Classification and Segmentation (JCS) system to
perform real-time and explainable COVID-19 chest CT diagnosis. To train our JCS
system, we construct a large scale COVID-19 Classification and Segmentation
(COVID-CS) dataset, with 144,167 chest CT images of 400 COVID-19 patients and
350 uninfected cases. 3,855 chest CT images of 200 patients are annotated with
fine-grained pixel-level labels of opacifications, which are increased
attenuation of the lung parenchyma. We also have annotated lesion counts,
opacification areas, and locations and thus benefit various diagnosis aspects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed JCS diagnosis system is
very efficient for COVID-19 classification and segmentation. It obtains an
average sensitivity of 95.0% and a specificity of 93.0% on the classification
test set, and 78.5% Dice score on the segmentation test set of our COVID-CS
dataset. The COVID-CS dataset and code are available at

issue. Scientists all over the world have been heavily invested in the
discovery of a drug to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has been found that RNA-dependent

SARS-CoV-2; indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the
enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also
investigated to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the
two compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes
revealed that positions of the amino acid Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138,

quickly and reliably prioritize clinically approved compounds for their
potential effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the past decade, network
medicine has developed and validated multiple predictive algorithms for drug
repurposing, exploiting the sub-cellular network-based relationship between a
drug's targets and disease genes. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on
artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each
of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To
test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs that had been
experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, and the list of drugs under clinical
trial, that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential
COVID-19 efficacy. We find that while most algorithms offer predictive power
for these ground truth data, no single method offers consistently reliable
outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This prompted us to develop a
multimodal approach that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, showing that
a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the
performance of the best individual pipelines. We find that 76 of the 77 drugs
that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by
SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these drugs rely on network-based actions that
cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a
methodological pathway to identify repurposable drugs for future pathogens and
neglected diseases underserved by the costs and extended timeline of de novo
drug development.

arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can
lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus
the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are
favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune
phase. As usage decreases there is a novel ""contact tracing"" phase transition
to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for
COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the

strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose

prototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that
facilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally
identifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app
allows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with
no other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for
scalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called
'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data
platform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our
mobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of
verifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and
digital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive
digital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly
in the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For

vaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are
focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing,
contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We
develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of
these mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to
COVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that the
pandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario
projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of
anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New
York State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%,
respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are
maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early
termination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave
with burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict
social-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%)
could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents
of New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at
least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks,
such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant
reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to
elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other
anti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic.
The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is
combined with strict social-distancing.

this step, two optimal control problems (mono- and multi-objective) to

together the quantity of infected individuals and the prescribed vaccine
concentration during the treatment, i.e., a multi-objective optimal control
problem. The solution of each optimal control problems is obtained using DE and
Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE) algorithms, respectively. The
results regarding the proposed multi-objective optimal control problem provides

limited by the shortage of radiology experts who can provide a timely
interpretation of these images. Motivated by this challenge, our paper proposes
a novel learning architecture, called Detail-Oriented Capsule Networks
(DECAPS), for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from Computed Tomography (CT)
scans. Our network combines the strength of Capsule Networks with several
architecture improvements meant to boost classification accuracies. First,
DECAPS uses an Inverted Dynamic Routing mechanism which increases model
stability by preventing the passage of information from non-descriptive
regions. Second, DECAPS employs a Peekaboo training procedure which uses a
two-stage patch crop and drop strategy to encourage the network to generate
activation maps for every target concept. The network then uses the activation
maps to focus on regions of interest and combines both coarse and fine-grained
representations of the data. Finally, we use a data augmentation method based
on conditional generative adversarial networks to deal with the issue of data
scarcity. Our model achieves 84.3% precision, 91.5% recall, and 96.1% area
under the ROC curve, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We
compare the performance of the DECAPS model with three experienced,
well-trained thoracic radiologists and show that the architecture significantly
outperforms them. While further studies on larger datasets are required to
confirm this finding, our results imply that architectures like DECAPS can be
used to assist radiologists in the CT scan mediated diagnosis of COVID-19.

  In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages
structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network
module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships
among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights.
  With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we
initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the
COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models
pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate
RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation).
Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and
performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.

  Pandemic: An Autonomous Logistic Vehicle for Contactless Goods Transportation","Since early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly
across the world. As at the date of writing this article, the disease has been
globally reported in 223 countries and regions, infected over 108 million
people and caused over 2.4 million deaths (https://covid19.who.int/, accessed
on Feb. 17, 2021). Avoiding person-to-person transmission is an effective
approach to control and prevent the pandemic. However, many daily activities,
such as transporting goods in our daily life, inevitably involve
person-to-person contact. Using an autonomous logistic vehicle to achieve
contact-less goods transportation could alleviate this issue. For example, it
can reduce the risk of virus transmission between the driver and customers.
Moreover, many countries have imposed tough lockdown measures to reduce the
virus transmission (e.g., retail, catering) during the pandemic, which causes
inconveniences for human daily life. Autonomous vehicle can deliver the goods
bought by humans, so that humans can get the goods without going out. These
demands motivate us to develop an autonomous vehicle, named as Hercules, for
contact-less goods transportation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The vehicle is
evaluated through real-world delivering tasks under various traffic conditions.

  Measures in the Presence of Infection Hotspots","Multiple lines of evidence at the individual and population level strongly
suggest that infection hotspots, or superspreading events, where a single
individual infects many others, play a key role in the transmission dynamics of
COVID-19. However, most of the existing epidemiological models either assume or
result in a Poisson distribution of the number of infections caused by a single
infectious individual, often called secondary infections. As a result, these
models overlook the observed overdispersion in the number of secondary
infections and are unable to accurately characterize infection hotspots. In
this work, we aim to fill this gap by introducing a temporal point process
framework that explicitly represents sites where infection hotspots may occur.
Under our model, overdispersion on the number of secondary infections emerges
naturally. Moreover, using an efficient sampling algorithm, we demonstrate how
to apply Bayesian optimization with longitudinal case data to estimate the
transmission rate of infectious individuals at sites they visit and in their
households, as well as the mobility reduction due to social distancing.
Simulations using fine-grained demographic data and site locations from several
cities and regions demonstrate that our framework faithfully characterizes the
observed longitudinal trend of COVID-19 cases. In addition, the simulations
show that our model can be used to estimate the effect of testing, contact
tracing, and containment at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, and
reveal that these measures do not decrease overdispersion in the number of
secondary infections.

  cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown","Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

SARS-CoV-2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level
that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require
quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and
may cause unprecedented socio-economic impact. A viable alternative to mass
surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by
means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices
could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting

technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help
limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and
enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures. In this paper, we
outline general requirements and design principles of personal applications for
epidemic containment running on common smartphones, and we present a tool,

systems and methods for predicting the virus's behavior or detecting the
infection. One of the possible ways of determining the patient infection to
COVID-19 is through analyzing the chest X-ray images. As there are a large

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic evolution would be extremely
useful to support authorities in designing healthcare policies and lockdown

devised forecasts have been mostly based on a pure data-driven approach, by
fitting and extrapolating open data on the epidemic evolution collected by the
Italian Civil Protection Center. In this respect, SIR epidemiological models,
which start from the description of the nonlinear interactions between
population compartments, would be a much more desirable approach to understand

addresses the fundamental question whether a SIR epidemiological model,
suitably enriched with asymptomatic and dead individual compartments, could be
able to provide reliable predictions on the epidemic evolution. To this aim, a
machine learning approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is
proposed to automatically identify the model parameters based on a training set
of data of progressive increasing size, considering Lombardy in Italy as a case
study. The analysis of the scatter in the forecasts shows that model
predictions are quite sensitive to the size of the dataset used for training,
and that further data are still required to achieve convergent -- and therefore
reliable -- predictions.

of new infections, N/dN, in the current outbreak of COVID-19 is accurately
described by a universal function, namely the two-parameter Gumbel cumulative
function, in all countries that we have investigated. While the two Gumbel
parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country
(and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the
diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form
of the evolution of N/dN appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a
given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected
time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters
from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this
allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels,
the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration

detecting pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 with chest X-rays. This disease
is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom
convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are
trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to
learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is
transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the
related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or
COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned
to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the
best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble
strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models
significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area
under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined
use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and
ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model
can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs.

it is essential to trace, as early as possible, the susceptible people who
might have been infected by the disease due to their close proximity with
people who were tested positive for the virus. This early contact tracing is
likely to limit the rate of spread of the infection within a locality. In this
paper, we investigate how effectively and efficiently can such a list of
susceptible people be found given a list of infected persons and their
locations. To address this problem from an information retrieval (search)
perspective, we represent the location of each person at each time instant as a
point in a vector space. By using the locations of the given list of infected
persons as queries, we investigate the feasibility of applying approximate
nearest neighbour (ANN) based indexing and retrieval approaches to obtain a
list of top-k suspected users in real-time. Since leveraging information from
true user location data can lead to security and privacy concerns, we also
investigate what effects does distance-preserving encoding methods have on the
effectiveness of the ANN methods. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that the top-k retrieved lists of susceptible users
retrieved with existing ANN approaches (KD-tree and HNSW) yield satisfactory
precision and recall values, thus indicating that ANN approaches can
potentially be applied in practice to facilitate real-time contact tracing even

  from the fatality time series in COVID-19 outbreaks","In the absence of other tools, monitoring the effects of protective measures,
including social distancing and forecasting the outcome of outbreaks is of
immense interest. Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic
errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of
empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In
this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a
master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic
reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection
rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable
differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities.
We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows
this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic
growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic
reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the
outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The
difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the
separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal
variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model
remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.

model was calibrated and applied to perform predictions of people needing to be

showing a prediction of diagnosed infected and deaths which will be observed
after the ease of the total lockdown produced the 13th of March. Is also shown
how this model can provide an insight of what the level of infection in the
different regions of Spain is forecasted. The model predicts for Spain for the
end of May more than 400,000 diagnosed infected cases, number which will be
probably higher due to the change in the possibilities of performing massive
number of tests to the general population. The number of forecasted deaths for
that date is 46,000 +/- 15,000. The model also predicts the level of infection
at the different Spanish regions, providing a counterintuitive result in the
cases of Madrid and Catalonia as the result shows a higher the level of
infection at Catalonia than the level at Madrid, according with this model. All
of these results can be used to guide policy makers in order to optimize

importance that the broader scientific community is currently facing. One of

factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of
short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the
same time, so that their latent correlation structures are captured in the
dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results
can be directly attributed to the learned dictionary patterns due to their
interpretability.

concerns people are posting about, can help us to better understand the
situation, and come up with better planning. In this work, we propose a model
based on sentence Transformer to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent
months. The proposed model first learns sentence-level representation of
tweets, and then group them based on their embedding similarities into some
groups, and then detect the most important words in each cluster based on their
frequency and average similarity to other words. Through experimental results,
we show that our model can detect very informative topics, by processing the
tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the
tweets). The proposed model is trained in an unsupervised fashion, and can be
applied to any dataset our textual data from social media websites.

  on Constrained Scale-Free Networks","The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human
networks. Here, the real-space urban life of people is modeled as a scale-free
network with constraints. A scale-free network has been adopted for modeling
on-line communities so far but is employed here for the aim to represent
peoples' social behaviors where the generated communities are restricted
reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the real life. As a result, three
findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the height of the
peaks in the time sequence of the number of infection cases tends to get
reduced corresponding to the upper bound of the size of groups where all
members meet. Second, if we adopt the constraint on m0, the number of all other
people one meets separately each at a time, to the range between 2 and 8, its
effect on the suppression of infections may be weak as far as we allow group
meetings of size W of 8 or larger. Third, such a moderate constraint may
temporarily seem to work for the reduction of infections in the early stage but
it may turn out to be just a delay of peaks. Based on these results, a policy
is proposed here: for quickly suppressing the number of infections, restrict W
to less than 4 if the constraint to make m0 at most 1 is too strict. If W is
set to less than 4, setting m0 to 4 or less works for quick reduction of
infections according to the result.

the effect of containment strategies) from available aggregated data, such as
number of deaths and hospitalizations. The method, that was used for HIV-AIDS
and was named `back-calculation', relies on good estimates of the distribution
of the delays between infection and the observed events; assuming that the
epidemic follows a simple SIR model with a known generation interval, we can
then estimate the parameters that define the time-varying contact rate through
maximum likelihood. We show the application of the method to data from Italy
and several of its region; it is found that $R_0$ had decreased consistently
below 1 around March 20, and in the beginning of April it was between 0.5 and
0.8 in the whole Italy and in most regions.

  purely non-pharmaceutical interventions","When effective medical treatment and vaccination are not available,
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, home quarantine and
far-reaching shutdown of public life are the only available strategies to
prevent the spread of epidemics. Based on an extended SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) model and continuous-time optimal
control theory, we compute the optimal non-pharmaceutical intervention strategy
for the case that a vaccine is never found and complete containment
(eradication of the epidemic) is impossible. In this case, the optimal control
must meet competing requirements: First, the minimization of disease-related
deaths, and, second, the establishment of a sufficient degree of natural
immunity at the end of the measures, in order to exclude a second wave.
Moreover, the socio-economic costs of the intervention shall be kept at a
minimum. The numerically computed optimal control strategy is a
single-intervention scenario that goes beyond heuristically motivated
interventions and simple ""flattening of the curve."" Careful analysis of the
computed control strategy reveals, however, that the obtained solution is in
fact a tightrope walk close to the stability boundary of the system, where
socio-economic costs and the risk of a new outbreak must be constantly balanced
against one another. The model system is calibrated to reproduce the initial
exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany.

performance in higher education. Using a field experiment of 458 students from
three different subjects in Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (Spain), we study
the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of
the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect
of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also
significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in
their learning performance.

findings suggest that to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and

Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread worldwide. As it currently
spreading in the United States, policy makers, public health officials and
citizens are racing to understand the impact of this virus on the United States
healthcare system. They fear that the rapid influx of patients will overwhelm
the healthcare system leading to unnecessary fatalities. Most countries and
states in America have introduced mitigation strategies, such as social
distancing, to decrease the rate of newly infected people, i.e. flattening the
curve.In this paper, we analyze the time evolution of the number of people
hospitalized due to the coronavirus using the methods of queueing theory. Given
that the rate of new infections varies over time as the pandemic evolves, we
model the number of coronavirus patients as a dynamical system based on the
theory of infinite server queues with non-stationary Poisson arrival rates.
With this model we are able to quantify how flattening the curve affects the
peak demand for hospital resources. This allows us to characterize how
aggressively society must flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the
capacity of healthcare system. We also demonstrate how flattening the curve
impacts the elapsed time between the peak rate of hospitalizations and the time
of the peak demand for the hospital resources. Finally, we present empirical
evidence from China, South Korea, Italy and the United States that supports the
insights from the model.

strengths: i) it only has 83K parameters and is thus not easy to overfit; ii)
it has high computational efficiency and is thus convenient for practical
deployment; iii) it can be fast retrained by other users using their private

  and Health Measures for Covid-19 Pandemic","Pandemics have threatened human race many a times. One of the most important
tasks during a pandemic is to bring awareness among people. Bringing awareness
contributes a lot in controlling any pandemic. Covid-19 has been causing severe
loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and the level of
severity of this disease, it is extremely important to make people aware of
various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining
social distancing, that are to be followed to prevent the disease and break the
chain of spread. This mode of educating individuals about the disease is being
widely carried out as announcements through online or physical awareness
campaigns, advertisements in the media and so on. The younger generations in
the present day spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games.
However, there are very few mobile applications or games, aimed to bring
awareness about a pandemic, which is much lesser in case of Covid-19. Also,
considering the lockdown scenario across the world, games also act as a good
pass time indoors. Hence, we propose a 2D survival based game, SurviveCovid-19,
aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19
outside their homes, by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and
sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android based

systems across the world. With limited testing kits, it is impossible for every
patient with respiratory illness to be tested using conventional techniques
(RT-PCR). The tests also have long turn-around time, and limited sensitivity.
Detecting possible COVID-19 infections on Chest X-Ray may help quarantine high
risk patients while test results are awaited. X-Ray machines are already
available in most healthcare systems, and with most modern X-Ray systems
already digitized, there is no transportation time involved for the samples
either. In this work we propose the use of chest X-Ray to prioritize the
selection of patients for further RT-PCR testing. This may be useful in an
inpatient setting where the present systems are struggling to decide whether to
keep the patient in the ward along with other patients or isolate them in
COVID-19 areas. It would also help in identifying patients with high likelihood
of COVID with a false negative RT-PCR who would need repeat testing. Further,
we propose the use of modern AI techniques to detect the COVID-19 patients
using X-Ray images in an automated manner, particularly in settings where
radiologists are not available, and help make the proposed testing technology
scalable. We present CovidAID: COVID-19 AI Detector, a novel deep neural
network based model to triage patients for appropriate testing. On the publicly
available covid-chestxray-dataset [2], our model gives 90.5% accuracy with 100%

  An Exploratory Study","The objective of this article is to explore the Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) interventions and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and
threats for the containment of the pandemic spread of novel Coronavirus. The
research adopted a qualitative research approach, while the study data were
collected through online content review and Focus Group Discussion (FGD).
Starting with a preliminary set of about 1200 electronic resources or contents,
56 were selected for review study, applying an inclusion and exclusion
criteria. The review study revealed ICT interventions that include websites and
dashboards, mobile applications, robotics and drones, artificial intelligence
(AI), data analytic, wearable and sensor technology, social media and learning
tools, and interactive voice response (IVR) as well as explored their
respective usages to combat the pandemic spread of COVID-19. Later, the FGD was
replicated with 22 participants and explored the possible strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of deploying such technologies to
fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. This research not only explores the
exiting status of ICT interventions to fight with the COVID-19 pandemic but
also provides a number of implications for the government, practitioners,
doctors, policymakers and researchers for the effective utilization of the
existing ICT interventions and for the future potential research and
technological development to the containment of the pandemic spread of COVID-19

  General Public to the COVID-19 Pandemic","Recently, the pandemic of the novel Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has
presented governments with ultimate challenges. In the United States, the
country with the highest confirmed COVID-19 infection cases, a nationwide
social distancing protocol has been implemented by the President. For the first
time in a hundred years since the 1918 flu pandemic, the US population is
mandated to stay in their households and avoid public contact. As a result, the
majority of public venues and services have ceased their operations. Following
the closure of the University of Washington on March 7th, more than a thousand
colleges and universities in the United States have cancelled in-person classes
and campus activities, impacting millions of students. This paper aims to
discover the social implications of this unprecedented disruption in our
interactive society regarding both the general public and higher education
populations by mining people's opinions on social media. We discover several
topics embedded in a large number of COVID-19 tweets that represent the most
central issues related to the pandemic, which are of great concerns for both
college students and the general public. Moreover, we find significant
differences between these two groups of Twitter users with respect to the
sentiments they expressed towards the COVID-19 issues. To our best knowledge,
this is the first social media-based study which focuses on the college student
community's demographics and responses to prevalent social issues during a

  cases: A data-driven analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency
of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the
globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than
11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide.
The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time)
forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk
assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some
profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic
characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To
solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive
integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can
generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed
cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of
the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective
allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for
government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal
regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly
affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven
analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk
assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.

providing real-time forecasts of the epidemics pushes fits of dynamical and
statistical models to available data beyond their capabilities. Here we focus
on statistical predictions of COVID-19 infections performed by fitting
asymptotic distributions to actual data. By taking as a case-study the epidemic
evolution of total COVID-19 infections in Chinese provinces and Italian
regions, we find that predictions are characterized by large uncertainties at
the early stages of the epidemic growth. Those uncertainties significantly
reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of
the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the
spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics
counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on
the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the
intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics. These results
suggest that real-time epidemiological projections should include wide
uncertainty ranges and urge for the needs of compiling high-quality datasets of
infections counts, including asymptomatic patients.

confirmed in Hokkaido, Japan in February 2020. To capture the clusters, this
study employs Web search query logs and user location information from
smartphones. [Material and Methods] First, we anonymously identified smartphone
users who used a Web search engine (Yahoo! JAPAN Search) for the COVID-19 or
its symptoms via its companion application for smartphones (Yahoo Japan App).
We regard these searchers as Web searchers who are suspicious of their own

the smartphone application. The spatio-temporal distribution of the number of
WSSCI are compared with the actual location of the known two clusters. [Result
and Discussion] Before the early stage of the cluster development, we could
confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our
WSSCI-based approach. However, it is accurate only in the early stage, and it
was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the
case where the other cluster-related resources, such as fine-grained population
statistics, are not available, the proposed metric would be helpful to catch
the hint of emerging clusters.

COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However, the impacts of specific
state-level policies on mobility and subsequent COVID-19 case trajectories have
not been completely quantified. Using anonymized and aggregated mobility data
from opted-in Google users, we found that state-level emergency declarations
resulted in a 9.9% reduction in time spent away from places of residence.
Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an
additional 24.5% reduction in mobility the following week, and subsequent
shelter-in-place mandates yielded an additional 29.0% reduction. Decreases in
mobility were associated with substantial reductions in case growth 2 to 4
weeks later. For example, a 10% reduction in mobility was associated with a
17.5% reduction in case growth 2 weeks later. Given the continued reliance on
social distancing policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, these results may
be helpful to public health officials trying to balance infection control with
the economic and social consequences of these policies.

  Covid-19 Crises Unfolds","The lead-lag relationship plays a vital role in financial markets. It is the
phenomenon where a certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates
the movement of leading time-series. The present research proposes a new
technique which helps better identify the lead-lag relationship empirically.
Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a
measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the
proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic
Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it
retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose
metric. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead-lag
relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the
basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the
best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically
significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use
the measure to study the topology evolution of the Foreign Exchange market, as
the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX currency prices of 29
prominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises unfold, all
the currencies become strongly interlinked to each other. Also, USA Dollar
starts playing even more central role in the FX market. Finally, we mention
several other application areas of the proposed technique for designing
intelligent systems.

  disordered multiplex networks","The frequent emergence of diseases with the potential to become threats at
local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently
COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease
propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations.
Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context,
especially in human contact networks, here we examine the
susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex
network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a
fraction $q$ of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through
weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or
disordered); weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using
branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing
strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the
intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find
that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic
can be prevented, increase with the overlap $q$. Also we study the effect of
the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals,
which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find
that for relatively small values of the overlap $q$, social distancing policies
might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.

growth, before eventually slowing. In agreement with a recent statistical

the erf function. Using this functional form, we perform a data collapse across

social distancing policies, confirming the universal behavior of the COVID-19

COVID-19 has been automated contact tracing. Since proximity data can be
collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this
for automated contact tracing providing a major gain over a manual
implementation. In this work, we study the characteristics of voluntary and
automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a
pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and
social structures required for automated contact tracing to work. We display
the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequate sampling of the population,
which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact
with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a
significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.
We conclude that relying largely on automated contact tracing without
population-wide participation to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
can be counterproductive and allow the pandemic to spread unchecked. The
simultaneous implementation of various mitigation methods along with automated
contact tracing is necessary for reaching an optimal solution to contain the
pandemic.

the choice between full and fractional counting. However, several studies

Twenty-one of the 29 counting methods are rank-dependent and fractionalized

equal shares, for example harmonic counting. The internal and external
validation of the counting methods are assessed. Three criteria for
well-constructed bibliometric indicators - adequacy, sensitivity, and
homogeneity - are used to assess the internal validity. Regarding the external
validation of the counting methods, it is investigated whether the intentions
in the studies that introduced the 29 counting methods comply with the
subsequent use of the counting methods. This study has the potential to give a
solid foundation for the use of and discussion about counting methods.

  respiratory droplets and their role in Covid-19 outbreaks","One of the many unresolved questions that revolves around the Covid-19
pandemic is whether local outbreaks can depend on ambient conditions like
temperature and relative humidity. In this paper, we develop a model that tries
to explain and describe the temperature and relative humidity sensitivity of
respiratory droplets and their possible connection in determining viral
outbreaks. The model has two parts. First, we model the growth rate of the
infected population based on a reaction mechanism - the final equations of
which are similar to the well-known SIR model. The advantage of modeling the
pandemic using the reaction mechanism is that the rate constants have sound
physical interpretation. The infection rate constant is derived using collision
rate theory and shown to be a function of the respiratory droplet lifetime. In
the second part, we have emulated the respiratory droplets responsible for
disease transmission as salt solution droplets and computed their evaporation
time accounting for droplet cooling, heat and mass transfer and finally
crystallization of the salt. The model output favourably compares with the
experimentally obtained evaporation characteristics of levitated droplets of
pure water and salt solution, respectively, ensuring fidelity of the model.
Droplet evaporation/desiccation time is indeed dependent on ambient temperature
and relative humidity, considered at both outdoor and indoor conditions. Since
the droplet evaporation time determines the infection rate constant, ambient
temperature and relative humidity are shown to impact the outbreak growth
rates.

Mittag-Leffler functions of the adjacency matrix of the network of inter-amino

find that the perturbations produced by strong inhibitors of the protease are
propagated far away from the binding site, confirming the long-range nature of
intra-protein communication. On the contrary, the weakest inhibitors only
transmit their perturbations across a close environment around the binding
site. These findings may help to the design of drug candidates against this new

  for prediction scenarios","Mathematical models are traditionally used to analyze the long-term global
evolution of epidemics, to determine the potential and severity of an outbreak,
and to provide critical information for identifying the type of disease
interventions and intensity. One of the widely used mathematical models of
long-term spreading of epidemics are the so-called deterministic compartmental
models (SIR/SEIR type models). One of the main purposes of applying such models
is to assess how the expensive restriction measures imposed by the authorities
(home and social isolation/quarantine, travel restrictions, etc.) can
effectively reduce the control reproduction number of the disease and its
transmission risk. However the classical SIR/SEIR models have been primarily
studied in what may be called stationary case, where the main parameters, the
Transmission rate Beta (reflecting the virus spread by infected individuals)
and the Removed rate Gamma (reflecting the hospitalization/isolation measures)
remain constant during the whole period of interest. Hence, it is important to
extend the classical SIR/SEIR models by creating new ansatzes for the dynamics
of the transmission rates Beta(t) (which we will call further just Beta) and
removed rates Gamma(t) (which we will call further just Gamma). The main
purpose of the present research is to introduce a spline-based SEIR model with
Time-varying Beta and Gamma parameters, or abbreviated TVBG-SEIR model, which
is used to estimate the practical implications of the public health
interventions and measures. We have designed a Tool based on the TVBG-SEIR

European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical
interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and
universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most
recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns.
  In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of
infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive
number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these
interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in
behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from
temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of
transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic
time lag between infection and death.
  In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al

effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more

address that critique by fitting a generalized additive model to weekly counts

produces baseline rates of death registrations expected without the COVID-19
pandemic, and comparing those baselines to recent counts of registered deaths
exposes the emergence of excess deaths late in March 2020. By April's end,
England and Wales registered 45,300 $\pm$ 3200 excess deaths of adults aged
45+. Through 22 May, the last day of available all-deaths data, 56,600 $\pm$

corresponding count of 43,205 death certificates which mention COVID-19, and
the Department of Health and Social Care's count of 33,671 deaths, are
appreciably less, implying that their counting methods have underestimated, not
overestimated, the pandemic's true death toll. If underreporting rates have
held steady during May, about 59,000 direct and indirect COVID-19 deaths might
have been registered through the end of May but not yet publicly reported in

at the level of countries and states of the United States. We show that during
the earlier part of the epidemic, using travel data increases the predictions.
Training the model to forecast also enables learning characteristics of the
epidemic. In particular, we show that changes in model parameters over time can
help us quantify how well a state or a country has responded to the epidemic.
The variations in parameters also allow us to forecast different scenarios such
as what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.

1 out of 750 cases of infection. After correcting for different testing rates,
this result is compatible with a measurement of the ratio made recently via

prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample
pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2.
  Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six
different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate,
test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations
in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19
outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and
testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised
prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of
cases identified; and number of false positives.
  Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input
parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen
one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when
prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised
testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the
US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight
times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are
considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex
pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also
reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%.
  Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for
adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of
testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily
wastes valuable time and resources.

mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and
hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And
infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper.
By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical
solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and
with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23
January to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction
days. Compared with integer-order system ($\alpha=0$), the fractional-order
model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on
Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case
without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be
not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down
and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not
adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from
24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is
also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and
uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in
the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is
analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium
point is locally asymptotically stable when $R_0\le 1$, which provides a
theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.

timing of turning points, as well as best- and worst-case scenarios.
Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input
parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated
projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work
we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate
the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a
transient or stable state. Meta-projections can be extracted from graphs of
successive estimations of model's parameters and resulting projections, over a
sequence of days being gradually added to the employed model. In other words,
projections are carried out on truncated time series of cumulative numbers of
confirmed cases with increased lengths at each successive evaluation. This
allows us to trace the values of model parameters over a certain period of time
and examine their trends which may converge to specific values for
settled-growth cases or exhibit a changing or even an erratic behavior for
cases that undergo epidemiological transitions and/or are inappropriately
described by the current model instance(s). We have computed meta-projections
and compared our findings for countries at different stages of the epidemic
with stable or unstable behaviors and increasing or decreasing numbers of
confirmed cases. Our results indicate that meta-projections can aid researchers
in assessing the appropriateness of their relevant models and in effect
decrease the uncertainty in their estimations of an epidemic's severity and
development.

  Infection Segmentation","Purpose: Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 CT scans
plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the
existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are
impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists
are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare
current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different
datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics.
Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in
this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based
on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas,
e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a
fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard
training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the
corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide
more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as
out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for
researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We
achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3\%, 97.7\%, and
67.3\% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6\%, 91.4\%, and
70.0\% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. Conclusions: To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning
benchmark for medical image segmentation and the largest number of pre-trained
models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays
the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for
efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.

  and Applying Interventions?","The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is often used as a proxy for the
actual number of ground truth COVID-19 infected cases in both public discourse
and policy making. However, the number of confirmed cases depends on the
testing policy, and it is important to understand how the number of positive
cases obtained using different testing policies reveals the unknown ground
truth. We develop an agent-based simulation framework in Python that can
simulate various testing policies as well as interventions such as lockdown
based on them. The interaction between the agents can take into account various
communities and mobility patterns. A distinguishing feature of our framework is
the presence of another `flu'-like illness with symptoms similar to COVID-19,
that allows us to model the noise in selecting the pool of patients to be
tested. We instantiate our model for the city of Bengaluru in India, using
census data to distribute agents geographically, and traffic flow mobility data
to model long-distance interactions and mixing. We use the simulation framework
to compare the performance of three testing policies: Random Symptomatic
Testing (RST), Contact Tracing (CT), and a new Location Based Testing policy
(LBT). We observe that if a sufficient fraction of symptomatic patients come
out for testing, then RST can capture the ground truth quite closely even with
very few daily tests. However, CT consistently captures more positive cases.
Interestingly, our new LBT, which is operationally less intensive than CT,
gives performance that is comparable with CT. In another direction, we compare
the efficacy of these three testing policies in enabling lockdown, and observe
that CT flattens the ground truth curve maximally, followed closely by LBT, and
significantly better than RST.

emergency should be supported by operational measures to avoid a second virus

significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with
infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial
masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards ""social distancing"") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built
environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate
occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and
exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations.
Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies
and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data
(""Diamond Princess"" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part
of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable
infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such
measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by
occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to
combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The
model could be modified to consider other recurring scenarios in other public
buildings (e.g. tourist facilities, cultural buildings).

the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at
different times and grows exponentially. Hot spots, however, appear to grow
faster than neighboring subregions and dominate spatially aggregated

focusing on vaccinations, and on the other side, there is a need to propose
models that can help us in understanding the spread of these pandemics as it
can help governmental and other concerned agencies to be well prepared,
especially from pandemics, which spreads faster like COVID-19. The main reason
for some epidemic turning into pandemics is the connectivity among different
regions of the world, which makes it easier to affect a wider geographical
area, often worldwide. In addition, the population distribution and social
coherence in the different regions of the world is non-uniform. Thus, once the
epidemic enters a region, then the local population distribution plays an
important role. Inspired by these ideas, we proposed a mobility-based SIR model

  into Normal/COVID-19 Class","Recently, the lung infection due to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) affected a
large human group worldwide and the assessment of the infection rate in the
lung is essential for treatment planning. This research aims to propose a
Machine-Learning-System (MLS) to detect the COVID-19 infection using the CT
scan Slices (CTS). This MLS implements a sequence of methods, such as
multi-thresholding, image separation using threshold filter,
feature-extraction, feature-selection, feature-fusion and classification. The
initial part implements the Chaotic-Bat-Algorithm and Kapur's Entropy (CBA+KE)
thresholding to enhance the CTS. The threshold filter separates the image into
two segments based on a chosen threshold 'Th'. The texture features of these
images are extracted, refined and selected using the chosen procedures.
Finally, a two-class classifier system is implemented to categorize the chosen
CTS (n=500 with a pixel dimension of 512x512x1) into normal/COVID-19 group. In
this work, the classifiers, such as Naive Bayes (NB), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine with
linear kernel (SVM) are implemented and the classification task is performed
using various feature vectors. The experimental outcome of the SVM with
Fused-Feature-Vector (FFV) helped to attain a detection accuracy of 89.80%.

  Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model? A case Study of Covid-19 Pandemic","The rapidly spreading Covid-19 that affected almost all countries, was first
reported at the end of 2019. As a consequence of its highly infectious nature,
countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control
its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have
done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop
medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a
great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters
in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict
the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course
of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the
determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the
infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic
wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily
fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020
are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each
country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error
are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean
duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the
spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case).
Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the
inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly
estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by
comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were
realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were
retained.

  infection-dependent mitigation strategies","Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks may vary over time depending on the
societal response. Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social
distancing and the adoption of protective equipment aim precisely at reducing
transmission rates by reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects
of mitigation strategies on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission
rates that are influenced by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries
have been included in many variants of the classical SIR model. This class of
models is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the
population behavior has been affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid
distribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This
manuscript revisits a SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is
due to knowledge of infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes
individuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a
time-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through
a negative feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in
ecology and Michaelis-Menten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A
step-by-step derivation of the model is provided, together with an overview of
methods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback
structurally reduces the peak of infections. At the same time, feedback may
substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. Computational simulations
agree with the analytical predictions, and further suggest that infection peak
reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. If the
mitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter
is added to the SIR model, making it useful to illustrate the effects of
infection-dependent social distancing.

as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced
mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users
with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random
tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'
phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to
learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been
diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end
privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these
approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token
metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users.
  In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing
with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their
contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of
users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides
protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new
cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality
(PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the
intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We
specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients
have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.

used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of
nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its
removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the
peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020.
We also predict a 7$\%$ to 21$\%$ increase in the peak value of active infected
cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation
in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown
period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a
non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to
prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public
health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat,
it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health

  while Suppressing the Receptor ACE2","The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to
identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2
virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one
of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2). Thus, spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and
antiviral drugs. A novel method has been recently described by some of the
authors to pharmacologically downregulate the expression of target proteins at
the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational
advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block
protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the
folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulations of the entire
sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealed
the existence of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden in
the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening
repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the
expression of ACE2. We identified four compounds capable of lowering ACE2
expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. All these molecules were
found to inhibit the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, the antiviral activity has been tested
against live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020 strain). One of the selected drugs
(Artefenomel) could completely prevent cytopathic effects induced by the
presence of the virus, thus showing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2.
Ongoing studies are further evaluating the possibility of repurposing these
drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one
employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing
individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1)
significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a
population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the
population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking
is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when
universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower
filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we
compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected
that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies,
their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily
case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early
universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or
reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical
simulations.
  Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of
universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is
emerging as a key NPI; a ""mouth-and-nose lockdown"" is far more sustainable than
a ""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An
interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all.
We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for
correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure

COVID impacts based on monthly energy supply or estimated parameters, this
study contributes to another step that constructed the near-real-time daily CO2
emission inventories based on activity from power generation (for 29
countries), industry (for 73 countries), road transportation (for 406 cities),
aviation and maritime transportation and commercial and residential sectors
emissions (for 206 countries). The estimates distinguished the decline of CO2
due to COVID-19 from the daily, weekly and seasonal variations as well as the
holiday events. The COVID-related decreases in CO2 emissions in road
transportation (340.4 Mt CO2, -15.5%), power (292.5 Mt CO2, -6.4% compared to
2019), industry (136.2 Mt CO2, -4.4%), aviation (92.8 Mt CO2, -28.9%),
residential (43.4 Mt CO2, -2.7%), and international shipping (35.9Mt CO2,
-15%). Regionally, decreases in China were the largest and earliest (234.5 Mt
CO2,-6.9%), followed by Europe (EU-27 & UK) (138.3 Mt CO2, -12.0%) and the U.S.
(162.4 Mt CO2, -9.5%). The declines of CO2 are consistent with regional
nitrogen oxides concentrations observed by satellites and ground-based
networks, but the calculated signal of emissions decreases (about 1Gt CO2) will
have little impacts (less than 0.13ppm by April 30, 2020) on the overserved
global CO2 concertation. However, with observed fast CO2 recovery in China and
partial re-opening globally, our findings suggest the longer-term effects on
CO2 emissions are unknown and should be carefully monitored using multiple
measures.

used by frontline health-care workers, and are typically meant for one-time
usage. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage
of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and
re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of
N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene
electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic
effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple
decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining
charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration
efficiency post decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on
the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and
filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and show that it
is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration
efficiency.

infected people using mortality records. In addition, the model is dynamic in
the sense that it takes into account the policy measures introduced when we
solve the inverse problem. The results obtained in Spain have particular
practical relevance: the number of infected individuals can be $17$ times
higher than the data provided by the Spanish government on April $26$ $th$ in
the worst-case scenario. Assuming that the number of fatalities reflected in
the statistics is correct, $9.8$ percent of the population may be contaminated

affected regions in Spain. However, if we assume that the number of fatalities
is twice as high as the official numbers, the number of infections could have
reached $19.5\%$. In Galicia, one of the regions where the effect has been the
least, the number of infections does not reach $2.5 \%$ . Based on our
findings, we can: i) estimate the risk of a new outbreak before Autumn if we
lift the quarantine; ii) may know the degree of immunization of the population

  post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India","Several countries that have been successful in constraining the severity of
COVID-19 pandemic via ""lockdown"" are now considering to slowly end it, mainly
because of enormous socio-economic side-effects. An abrupt ending of lockdown
can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore,
carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post
upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social
contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and
Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with
fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet
and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase
in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth
of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown
phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools
for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical
intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed
SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear
conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country
specific mitigation of COVID-19 spread in post-lockdown phase.

  Conspiracy Theories in Social Media and the News","Rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and
low trust. Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the Covid-19
pandemic are proliferating given the lack of any authoritative scientific
consensus on the virus, its spread and containment, or on the long term social
and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently
circulating are ones suggesting that the 5G network activates the virus, that
the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a
bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it
as cover to launch a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to
dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent
events including the destruction of property, racially fueled attacks against
Asian Americans, and demonstrations espousing resistance to public health
orders countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl
social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated
machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks
supporting the generation of these stories. We show how the various narrative
frameworks fueling rumors and conspiracy theories rely on the alignment of
otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the
broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can
be monitored in near real-time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news
that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists.
Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative
frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be
helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.

accounting for the control measures, health service resources, and other local

dynamics of the epidemiological mechanism and dissects the spatiotemporal
structure of the spreading disease. To assess the uncertainty associated with
the prediction, we develop a projection band based on the envelope of the
bootstrap forecast paths. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated
by a simulation study. We apply the proposed method to model and forecast the

the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung
infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to
augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However,
segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including
high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between
infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is
impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep
model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection
Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify
infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial
decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map.
Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized
to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate
the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation
framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only
requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our
semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher
performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes

sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We

index (BMI), and educational background. We were able to quantify expected
changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby
Bluetooth-enabled devices between pre- and during-lockdown periods. We saw
reduced sociality as measured through mobility features, and increased virtual
sociality through phone usage. People were more active on their phones,
spending more time using social media apps, particularly around major news
events. Furthermore, participants had lower heart rate, went to bed later, and
slept more. We also found that young people had longer homestay than older
people during lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant
difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low
BMI group walked more. RADAR-base can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a
holistic view of behavioural changes in response to public health interventions
as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19.

the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Current predictive
models of the development of COVID-19, especially after mitigation efforts, are
largely based on extrapolating the data from other countries. Since most states
enforced stay-at-home orders towards the end of March, their effect should be
reflected in the death and infection counts at the end of April. Using the data
available until April 25th, we investigate the change in the infection rate due
to the mitigation efforts, and project death and infection counts until
September, 2020, for some of the most heavily impacted states: New York, New
Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois and Louisiana. We find that with the
current mitigation efforts five of those six states reduce their reproduction
number to a value less than one, stopping the exponential growth of the
pandemic. We also projected different scenarios after the mitigation is
relaxed. Analysis for other states can be found at

revealed that statistics related to social distancing, namely trip rate, miles
traveled per person, and percentage of population staying at home have all
showed an unexpected trend, which we named social distancing inertia. The
trends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics
started improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a
portion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing
voluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,
after about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite
the continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a
natural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the
extent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national
data showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S.
states and for all the studied statistics. The U.S. states showed a
synchronized trend, regardless of the timeline of their statewide COVID-19 case

features of the statistics of the Covid-19 epidemic in France. Standard SEIR
models distinguish essentially two regimes: either the disease is controlled
and the number of infected people rapidly decreases, or the disease spreads and
contaminates a significant fraction of the population until herd immunity is
achieved. After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not
enough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely
that the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of
the population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the
population still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions,
such as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in
an apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through
re-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are
limited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential
role on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these
two indicators. We provide theoretical and numerical results to sustain such a
view.

  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?","As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.

population. Using this to compare the relative decay of the number of deaths
per day between different regions in Italy, Spain and England, each applying in
principle the same social distancing procedures across the whole country, I
obtain an estimate of the total fraction of the population which had already
become infected by April 10th. In the most heavily affected regions, Lombardy,
Madrid and London, this fraction is higher than expected, i.e. $\approx 0.3$.
This result can then be converted to a determination of the infection fatality
rate $ifr$, which appears to be $ifr \approx 0.0025-0.005$, and even smaller in
London, somewhat lower than usually assumed. Alternatively, the result can also
be interpreted as an effectively larger fraction of the population than simple
counting would suggest if there is a variation in susceptibility to infection

and killed two hundred thousand people worldwide in less than five months, has
led many experts to focus on simulating its propagation dynamics in order to
have an estimated outlook for the not too distante future and so supporting the

SIR model to simulating the propagation dynamics of COVID-19 on the Cape Verde
Islands. It will be done firstly for Santiago and Boavista Islands, ant then
for Cape Verde in general. The choice of Santiago rests on the fact that it is
the largest island, with more than 50% of the Population of the country,
whereas Boavista was chosen because it is the island where the first case of
COVID-19 in Cape Verde was diagnosed. Observations made after the date of the
simulations were carried out corroborates our projections.

nearest neighbor search using unconstrained dynamic time warping as distance
measure to deal with non-uniform time series lenghts. Thereby, a sequence of
labels is assigned for each time series. Completion of the last label sequence
permits prediction of individual time series. Proposed method is evaluated on
two global COVID-19 datasets, first, for the number of daily net cases (daily
new infections minus daily recoveries), and, second, for the number of daily
deaths attributed to COVID-19 as of April 27, 2020. The first dataset involves
249 time series for different countries, each of length 96. The second dataset

advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an
existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been
adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty

preparedness, fear related to the pandemic and home office ergonomics all
affect wellbeing or productivity. Exploratory analysis suggests that: (1)
women, parents and people with disabilities may be disproportionately affected;
(2) different people need different kinds of support. Conclusions. To improve

intensity in individual countries, suggesting it is important to analyse
factors that vary between them. We study measures of `population-weighted
density', which capture density as perceived by a randomly chosen individual.
These measures of population density can significantly explain variation in the
initial rate of spread of COVID-19 between countries within Europe. However,
such measures do not explain differences on a global scale, particularly when
considering countries in East Asia, or looking later into the epidemics.
Therefore, to control for country-level differences in response to COVID-19 we
consider the cross-cultural measure of individualism proposed by Hofstede. This
score can significantly explain variation in the size of epidemics across
Europe, North America, and East Asia. Using both our measure of
population-weighted density and the Hofstede score we can significantly explain
half the variation in the current size of epidemics across Europe and North
America. By controlling for country-level responses to the virus and population
density, our analysis of the global incidence of COVID-19 can help focus
attention on epidemic control measures that are effective for individual
countries.

practice; 2) the states with more confirmed cases have taken more active and
timely responses in practicing social distancing; 3) people in the states with
fewer confirmed cases did not pay much attention to maintaining social
distancing and some states, e.g., Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already
began to practice less social distancing despite the high increasing speed of
confirmed cases; 4) some counties with the highest infection rates are not
performing much social distancing, e.g., Randolph County and Dougherty County
in Georgia, and some counties began to practice less social distancing right
after the increasing speed of confirmed cases went down, e.g., in Blaine
County, Idaho, which may be dangerous as well.

  in the times of COVID-19","We conduct a unique, Amazon MTurk-based global experiment to investigate the
importance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why
the COVID-19 outbreak has exploded. The scientific basis for our inquiry is the
well-established fact that disease spread, especially in the initial stages,
follows an exponential function meaning few positive cases can explode into a
widespread pandemic if the disease is sufficiently transmittable. We define
prediction bias as the systematic error arising from faulty prediction of the
number of cases x-weeks hence when presented with y-weeks of prior, actual data
on the same. Our design permits us to identify the root of this
under-prediction as an EGPB arising from the general tendency to underestimate
the speed at which exponential processes unfold. Our data reveals that the
""degree of convexity"" reflected in the predicted path of the disease is
significantly and substantially lower than the actual path. The bias is
significantly higher for respondents from countries at a later stage relative
to those at an early stage of disease progression. We find that individuals who
exhibit EGPB are also more likely to reveal markedly reduced compliance with
the WHO-recommended safety measures, find general violations of safety
protocols less alarming, and show greater faith in their government's actions.
A simple behavioral nudge which shows prior data in terms of raw numbers, as
opposed to a graph, causally reduces EGPB. Clear communication of risk via raw
numbers could increase accuracy of risk perception, in turn facilitating
compliance with suggested protective behaviors.

approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and

popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution

precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object
classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is
computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the
centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index
term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol.
From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort

  X-Rays","Purpose: We present image classifiers based on Dense Convolutional Networks
and transfer learning to classify chest X-ray images according to three labels:
COVID-19, pneumonia and normal.
  Methods: We fine-tuned neural networks pretrained on ImageNet and applied a
twice transfer learning approach, using NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset as an
intermediate step. We also suggested a novelty called output neuron keeping,
which changes the twice transfer learning technique. In order to clarify the
modus operandi of the models, we used Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to
generate heatmaps.
  Results: We were able to reach test accuracy of 100% on our test dataset.
Twice transfer learning and output neuron keeping showed promising results
improving performances, mainly in the beginning of the training process.
Although LRP revealed that words on the X-rays can influence the networks'
predictions, we discovered this had only a very small effect on accuracy.
  Conclusion: Although clinical studies and larger datasets are still needed to
further ensure good generalization, the state-of-the-art performances we
achieved show that, with the help of artificial intelligence, chest X-rays can
become a cheap and accurate auxiliary method for COVID-19 diagnosis. Heatmaps
generated by LRP improve the interpretability of the deep neural networks and
indicate an analytical path for future research on diagnosis. Twice transfer
learning with output neuron keeping improved performances.

to the estimated number of commuters traveling by car. We then evaluate
increased vehicle volumes on the road if different portions of transit and car
pool users switch to single-occupancy vehicles, and report the resulting travel
time from the BPR model. The scenarios predict that cities with large transit

prevent the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. Recently, several efforts
have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions
using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and
smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially
violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g.,
GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use
personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers
organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for
social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive
and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees
and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties.
Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure
protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's
location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately
identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then
informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled
applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of
people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise
exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and
implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest. We, also,
validate the practicality of Quest and evaluate it thoroughly via an actual
campus-scale deployment at UC Irvine over a very large dataset of over 50M

to the rule of isolation may involve restrictions in freedom during daily

necessitated the adequate understanding of the evolutionary pathway of zoonotic
viruses which adversely affects human populations for therapeutic constructs to
combat the pandemic now and in the future. We analyzed conserved domains of the
severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV2] for possible targets of
viral entry inhibition in host cells, evolutionary relationship of human
coronavirus [229E] and zoonotic coronaviruses with SAR-CoV2 as well as
evolutionary relationship between selected SARS-CoV 2 genomic data. Conserved
domains with antagonistic action on host innate antiviral cellular mechanisms
in SARS-CoV 2 include nsp 11, nsp 13 etc. Also, multiple sequence alignments of
the spike [S] gene protein of selected candidate zoonotic coronaviruses
alongside the S gene protein of the SARs-CoV2 revealed closest evolutionary
relationship [95.6%] with pangolin coronaviruses [S] gene. Clades formed
between Wuhan SARS-CoV2 phylogeny data and five others suggests viral entry
trajectory while revealing genomic and protein SARS CoV 2 data from Philippines
as early ancestors. Therefore, phylogeny of SARS-CoV 2 genomic data suggests
profiling in diverse populations with and without the outbreak alongside
migration history and racial background for mutation tracking and dating of
viral subtype divergence which is essential for effective management of present
and future zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks.

  Comprehensive Survey and Open Problems","Social distancing plays a pivotal role in preventing the spread of viral
diseases illnesses such as COVID-19. By minimizing the close physical contact
among people, we can reduce the chances of catching the virus and spreading it
across the community. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how
emerging technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, artificial intelligence
(AI) can enable, encourage, and even enforce social distancing practice. To
that end, we first provide a comprehensive background of social distancing
including basic concepts, measurements, models, and propose various practical
social distancing scenarios. We then discuss enabling wireless technologies
which are especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep
distance, encourage, and enforce social distancing in general. After that,
other emerging and related technologies such as machine learning, computer
vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many
new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g.,
symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact
tracing. Finally, we provide important open issues and challenges (e.g.,
privacy-preserving, scheduling, and incentive mechanisms) in implementing
social distancing in practice. As an example, instead of reacting with ad-hoc
responses to COVID-19-like pandemics in the future, smart infrastructures
(e.g., next-generation wireless systems like 6G, smart home/building, smart
city, intelligent transportation systems) should incorporate a pandemic mode in
its standard architecture/design.

actions are grandly slowed down by the shortage of testing kits. Governments
have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become
more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency
measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to
100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program.
However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are
still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists
in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples
once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost.
However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which
patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected
patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify
them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy.
Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine
learning or clinical examinations. The resulting algorithms, which can be
interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and
quite surprising. They are patent-free. Co-authors are listed in alphabetical

  and Delaying the Epidemiological Curve While Allowing Economic and Social
  Life at Bearable Level During COVID-19 Pandemic","In this work, we simulate the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in a population
modeled as a network of groups wherein infection can propagate both via
intra-group and via inter-group interactions. Our results emphasize the
importance of diminishing the inter-group infections in the effort of
substantial flattening and delaying of the epi(demiologic) curve with
concomitant mitigation of disastrous economy and social consequences. To
exemplify with a limiting case, splitting a population into m (say, 5 or 10)
noninteracting groups while keeping intra-group interaction unchanged yields a
stretched epidemiologic curve having the maximum number of daily infections
reduced and postponed in time by the same factor $m$ (5 or 10). More generally,
our study suggests a practical approach to fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus
spread based on population splitting into groups and minimizing intermingling
between them. This strategy can be pursued by large-scale infrastructure
reorganization of activity at different levels in big logistic units (e.g.,
large productive networks, factories, enterprises, warehouses, schools,
(seasonal) harvest work). Importantly, unlike total lockdwon strategy, the
proposed approach prevents economic ruin and keeps social life at a more
bearable level than distancing everyone from anyone. Last but not least, the
declaration, for the first time in Europe, that COVID-19 epidemic ended in the
two million people Slovenia may be taken as confirming the advantage of the
strategy proposed in this paper.

detection, our method includes a two-stage validation mechanism, which is
performed in both Radon and image domains. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed method in comparison to the current state-of-the-art B-line
identification method and show a considerable performance gain with 87%
correctly detected B-lines in LUS images of nine COVID-19 patients. In
addition, owing to its fast convergence, our proposed method is readily
applicable for processing LUS image sequences.

  Multi-View Representation Learning","Recently, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread
rapidly across the world. Due to the large number of affected patients and
heavy labor for doctors, computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning
algorithm is urgently needed, and could largely reduce the efforts of
clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT)
has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In
this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of
features extracted from CT images. To fully explore multiple features
describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is
learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of
features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability.
Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural
networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the
representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types
of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the
case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison
methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the numbers
of training data.

policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to
simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more

that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a
reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant

inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social
distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing
that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the

number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of
social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social

  Multi-Instance Classification for Automated Severity Assessment of COVID-19
  in CT Images","Understanding chest CT imaging of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression.
Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an
essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive
clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the
severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the
lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this
end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity
assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe
segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few
infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we
first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image
patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance
deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of
COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet
consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe
segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a
unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context
information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the
performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a
real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results

disruptions to financial and economic markets around the globe, leading
eventually to fast stock market declines. In the past, markets have recovered
after any economic disruption. On this basis, we focus on the outbreak of
COVID-19 as a case study of an exogenous risk and analyze its impact on the
Standard and Poor's 500 (S\&P500) index. We assumed that the S\&P500 index
reaches a minimum before rising again in the not-too-distant future. Here we
present two cases to forecast the S\&P500 index. The first case uses an
estimation of expected deaths released on 02/04/2020 by the University of
Washington. For the second case, it is assumed that the peak number of deaths
will occur 2-months since the first confirmed case occurred in the USA. The
decline and recovery in the index were estimated for the following three months
after the initial point of the predicted trend. The forecast is a projection of
a prediction with stochastic fluctuations described by $q$-gaussian diffusion
process with three spatio-temporal regimes. Our forecast was made on the
premise that any market response can be decomposed into an overall
deterministic trend and a stochastic term. The prediction was based on the
deterministic part and for this case study is approximated by the extrapolation
of the S\&P500 data trend in the initial stages of the outbreak. The stochastic
fluctuations have the same structure as the one derived from the past 24 years.
A reasonable forecast was achieved with 85\% of accuracy.

  pandemic response governmental rules","The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) threatens the lives of millions of
people around the world, making it the largest health threat in recent times.
Billions of people around the world are asked to adhere to strict
shelter-in-place rules, finalised to slow down the spread of the virus. Appeals
and messages are being used by leaders and policy-makers to promote pandemic
response. Given the stakes at play, it is thus important for social scientists
to explore which messages are most effective in promoting pandemic response. In
fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several
messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In
this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages
on people's actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our
dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19
pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through
comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we
test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message
targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one
targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one
targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove
of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to
gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a
flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and on
time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions
through fliers have very little impact on people's reading and understanding of
COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.

  X-ray Images","Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world
since it came in sight in December 2019. It has already caused thousands of
causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool
that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and
possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently
use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and Computed Tomography (CT), which require significant time,
resources and acknowledged experts. X-ray imaging is a common and easily
accessible tool that has great potential for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study,
we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images.
Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced
not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training.
Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art
performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large
datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for
Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based
classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide
satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall
short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address
this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently
been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by
providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse
representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class
decision in representation based techniques.

health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a
complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid
identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases.
The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in
the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and
imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty
Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP
using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional
features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each
case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a
hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph.
The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score
measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process
of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case
belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia
dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five
hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on
the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

  Rate in an Infectious Disease like Covid-19","Covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damage
amounting to trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid development
of vaccine. Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question
on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely
focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk
groups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space,
which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate.
To demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describing
the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, for
infectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns,
locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers $R_0\sim 1.5-4$
the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations
compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to
the population density. For $R_0\sim 1$ we still find a significant increase of
the survival rate. The proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be further
tested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on the
importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official
guidelines.

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease.
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is
highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (89% similarity).
Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is
available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on
developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network,
using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions.
Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in
SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible

bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to
construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity
threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in
human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently
identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network
is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with
significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified
spreader proteins.

  spread model","In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of
the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is
modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying
pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary
infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the
model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious
individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A
Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the
relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new
data on the number of new infections and disease related death become
available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate
is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of
the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The
sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the
uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction
number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and
symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the
quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that
plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we
apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from
several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the
proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within
both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the
mitigation measures.

repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011

modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to
estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in

considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of
migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the
origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily
arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants
(i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and
active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days
needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence,
travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh

leverages the existing regulated mobile communication infrastructure and builds
upon the concept of ""checks and balances"", requiring a majority of independent

highly sensitive information that must be collected and processed for efficient
contact tracing. This is enforced with a largely decentralised layout and

  X-ray images with novel deep learning model","Background: Novel coronavirus disease has spread rapidly worldwide. As recent
radiological literatures on Covid-19 related pneumonia is primarily focused on
CT findings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends using portable
chest X-radiograph (CXR). A tool to assist for detection and monitoring of
Covid-19 cases from CXR is highly required. Purpose: To develop a fully
automatic framework to detect Covid-19 related pneumonia using CXR images and
evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: In this study, a novel deep
learning model, named CovIDNet (Covid-19 Indonesia Neural-Network), was
developed to extract visual features from chest x-ray images for the detection
of Covid-19 related pneumonia. The model was trained and validated by chest
x-rays datasets collected from several open source provided by GitHub and
Kaggle. Results and Discussion: In the validation stage using open-source data,
the accuracy to recognize Covid-19 and others classes reaches 98.44%, that is,
100% Covid-19 precision and 97% others precision. Discussion: The use of the
model to classify Covid-19 and other pathologies might slightly decrease the
accuracy. Although SoftMax was used to handle classification bias, this
indicates the benefit of additional training upon the introduction of new set
of data. Conclusion: The model has been tested and get 98.4% accuracy for open
source datasets, the sensitivity and specificity are 100% and 96.97%,
respectively.

  Policy Responses to COVID-19","This paper uses transaction data from a large bank in Scandinavia to estimate
the effect of social distancing laws on consumer spending in the COVID-19
pandemic. The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects
of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were
similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant
restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate
spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the
shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most
of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless
of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggest that
social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low
health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering
the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.

First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the

evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared

some information about community-level activity, dense distributed geophysical
sensing of ground motions across a city are more complete and also natively

captured seismic and geodetic signals produced by vehicles during the COVID-19

of roadbed deformation caused by local cars and trucks in an automatic template
matching detection algorithm to count the number of vehicles traveling per day
over a two-month period around the timing of the San Francisco Bay Area

grocery store on Sand Hill Road we find a 50% decrease in vehicle count
immediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a

  Large-Scale Data using Apache Spark","The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had burst out in Wuhan
China, specifically in December 2019. COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that
had not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread
and rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of
the confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases,
based on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of
the deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases
around the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with
different situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which
symptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to
construct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated
large-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19
data using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the
problem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in
decreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data.
CSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing,
and querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and
then index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes
to store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying
processes. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing
with large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A
set of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the
efficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.

  contact tracing","Many countries are currently gearing up to use smart-phone apps to perform
contact tracing as part of the effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and
prevent resurgences of the disease after the initial outbreak. With the
announcement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing
functionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in
many countries. An important part of the functionality of the app will be to
decide whether a person should be advised to self-isolate, be tested or end
isolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google contact
tracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not
possible so each phone must use its own ""risk model"" to inform decisions.
Ideally, the risk model should use Bayesian inference to decide the best course
of action given the test results of the user and those of other users. Here we
present a decentralised algorithm that estimates the Bayesian posterior
probability of viral transmission events and evaluates when a user should be
notified, tested or released from isolation while preserving user privacy. The
algorithm also allows the disease models on the phones to learn from everyone's
contact-tracing data and will allow Epidemiologists to better understand the
dynamics of the disease. The algorithm is a message passing algorithm, based on
belief propagation, so each smart-phone can be used to execute a small part of
the algorithm without releasing any sensitive information. In this way, the
network of all participating smart-phones forms a distributed computation
device that performs Bayesian inference, informs each user when they should
start/end isolation or be tested and learns about the disease from user's data.

  studies in Europe","In December 2019, the first patients in Wuhan, China were diagnosed with a
primary atypical pneumonia, which showed to be unknown and contagious. Since
then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2,
has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the
crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The
results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for
improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform
beyond the current public health dogma called ""flatten-the-curve"". There are
several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases.
Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data,
these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in
the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that
epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that
assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19
pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other
and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the
simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen
whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures
taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the
quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that
countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates
in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a
good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing
the spread of COVID-19.

Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast

  to slow down COVID-19 transmission","Now that various countries are or will soon be moving towards relaxing
shelter-in-place rules, it is important that people use a face covering, to
avoid an exponential resurgence of the spreading of the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19). Here we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a
heterogenous, although not representative, sample of people living in the USA,
where we test the relative effect of messages highlighting that the coronavirus
is a threat to ""you"" vs ""your family"" vs ""your community"" vs ""your country"" on
self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that focusing on
""your community"" promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative to the
baseline; the trend is the same when comparing ""your community"" to the other
conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of
gender differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less
than women intend to wear a face covering, but this difference almost
disappears in counties where wearing a face covering is mandatory. We also find
that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the
coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear
a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics
actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women).
Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions
felt when wearing a face covering. Men more than women agree that wearing a
face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and
these gender differences also mediate gender differences in intentions to wear
a face covering.

bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look
at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified
the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram
based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related
emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related
emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag
relationships between the time series of extracted emotions from official
bulletins and social media using Granger's causality showed that state
bulletins were leading the social media for some emotions such as Medical
Emergency. Further insights that are potentially relevant for the policymaker
and the communicators actively engaged in mitigating misinformation are also
discussed. Our paper also introduces CoronaIndiaDataset2, the first social
media based COVID-19 dataset at national and state levels from India with over
5.6 million national and 2.6 million state-level tweets. Finally, we present
our findings as COVibes, an interactive web application capturing psychometric

deaths and infected people. Although governments all over the world have taken
severe measurements to slow down the virus spreading (e.g., travel
restrictions, suspending all sportive, social, and economic activities,
quarantines, social distancing, etc.), a lot of persons have died and a lot
more are still in danger. Indeed, a recently conducted study~\cite{ref2} has
reported that 79\% of the confirmed infections in China were caused by
undocumented patients who had no symptoms. In the same context, in numerous
other countries, since coronavirus takes several days before the emergence of
symptoms, it has also been reported that the known number of infections is not
representative of the real number of infected people (the actual number is
expected to be much higher). That is to say, asymptomatic patients are the main
factor behind the large quick spreading of coronavirus and are also the major
reason that caused governments to lose control over this critical situation. To
contribute to remedying this global pandemic, in this paper, we propose an IoT
(Internet of Things) investigation system that was specifically designed to
spot both undocumented patients and infectious places. The goal is to help the
authorities to disinfect high-contamination sites and confine persons even if
they have no apparent symptoms. The proposed system also allows determining all
persons who had close contact with infected or suspected patients.
Consequently, rapid isolation of suspicious cases and more efficient control
over any pandemic propagation can be achieved.

  Sequentially Relaxing Restrictions by Age","Strong social distancing restrictions have been crucial to controlling the
COVID-19 outbreak thus far, and the next question is when and how to relax
these restrictions. A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups
is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health
risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to
mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations,
while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic
activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential
release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can
lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all
individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of
minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is
important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model
allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies,
which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and
planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
future outbreaks.

  COVID-19","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world
and it is affecting the whole society. The current gold standard test for
screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. However, the
COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming. Thus, as an
alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the
presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and
specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its
use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by
radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based
on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray.
Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A
(1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763
non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19),
respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or
non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally, these three models
were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and
184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results
show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model,
which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as it extracts more relevant semantic
features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of 94 % and a recall
of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening
patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for
better outcomes.

  COVID-19?","Smartphone-based electronic contact tracing is currently considered an
essential tool towards easing lockdowns, curfews, and shelter-in-place orders
issued by most governments around the world in response to the 2020 novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. While the focus on developing smartphone-based
contact tracing applications or apps has been on privacy concerns stemming from
the use of such apps, an important question that has not received sufficient
attention is: How reliable will such smartphone-based electronic contact
tracing be?
  This is a technical question related to how two smartphones reliably register
their mutual proximity. Here, we examine in detail the technical prerequisites
required for effective smartphone-based contact tracing. The underlying
mechanism that any contact tracing app relies on is called Neighbor Discovery
(ND), which involves smartphones transmitting and scanning for Bluetooth
signals to record their mutual presence whenever they are in close proximity.
The hardware support and the software protocols used for ND in smartphones,
however, were not designed for reliable contact tracing. In this paper, we
quantitatively evaluate how reliably can smartphones do contact tracing. Our
results point towards the design of a wearable solution for contact tracing
that can overcome the shortcomings of a smartphone-based solution to provide
more reliable and accurate contact tracing. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study that quantifies, both, the suitability and also the
drawbacks of smartphone-based contact tracing. Further, our results can be used
to parameterize a ND protocol to maximize the reliability of any contact
tracing app that uses it.

  Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital","Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as
""seasonal viruses"" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words,
meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this
information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In
this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals
in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from
patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We
propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of
positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds
of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these
distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations
to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological
conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar
variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings
highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a
related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under
different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be
easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced
approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as
those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is
at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the
proposed method is assessed through a simulation study.

due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To
evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic
model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household
income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a
crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can
use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period,
when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level.
The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a
lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance
(UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of
three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9%
in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income
earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the
combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero,
and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income
loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is
spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the
average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a
first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional
scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect
macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making
and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural
disasters).

changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly
to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments,
scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources
available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories,
to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this
paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining
advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend
analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for
quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two
recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the
Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information
including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain
initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical
topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories
through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and
automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our
methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery
systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid
scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues
in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

  intervention under ICU sustainability","We consider here an extended SIR model, including several features of the
recent COVID-19 outbreak: in particular the infected and recovered individuals
can either be detected (+) or undetected (-) and we also integrate an intensive
care unit (ICU) capacity. Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis
of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both
lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based
on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various
quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off
between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with
the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as
an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong
lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a
short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to
normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal
scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is
released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures
with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on
detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are
introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing
can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals
to be more moderate.

  quantitative perspective","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a variable
clinical presentation that ranges from asymptomatic, to severe disease with
cytokine storm. The mortality rates also differ across the globe, ranging from
0.5-13%. This variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host
factors may include genetic differences in the immune response genes as well as
variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better understand what impact these
genetic variants in immune response genes may have in the differences observed
in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical
systems model that considers both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the
subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve control of
infection is considered. Based on this broad quantitative framework it may be
posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations
of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses.
In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells
infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive
response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral
replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of the innate and adaptive
immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in
variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may
alter the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to develop successful
treatment strategies.

  different evolutionary models","The SIR evolutionary model predicts too sharp a decrease of the fractions of
people infected with COVID-19 in France after the start of the national
lockdown, compared to what is observed. I fit the daily hospital data: arrivals
in regular and critical care units, releases and deaths, using extended SEIR
models. These involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions,
assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, $R_0$,
before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The
joint-region Bayesian analysis allows precise evaluations of the time/fraction
ratios and pre-hospitalized fractions. The hospital data are well fit by the
models, except the arrivals in critical care, which decrease faster than
predicted, indicating better treatment over time. Averaged over France, the
analysis yields $R_0$= 3.4$\pm$0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65$\pm$0.04 (90%
c.l.) during the lockdown, with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the
Infection Fatality Rate in France was 4 $\pm$1% (90% c.l.), while the Feverish
vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the
lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have
occurred throughout France, while a lockdown that would have been enforced 10
days earlier would have led to less than 1000 deaths. The fraction of immunized
people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April
2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity. The widespread
availability of face masks on 11 May, when the lockdown was partially lifted,
should keep $R_0$ below unity if at least 46% of the population wear them
outside their home. Otherwise, without enhanced other social distancing, a
second wave is inevitable and cause the number of deaths to triple between
early May and October (if $R_0$=1.2) or even late June (if $R_0$=2).

evolution of death cases arising from coronavirus (COVID-19). The Death or `D'
model is a simplified version of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)
model, which assumes no recovery over time, and allows for the
transmission-dynamics equations to be solved analytically. The D-model can be
extended to describe various focuses of infection, which may account for the
original pandemic (D1), the lockdown (D2) and other effects (Dn). The evolution
of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries (China, Spain, Italy, France, UK,
Iran, USA and Germany) shows a similar behavior in concord with the D-model
trend, characterized by a rapid increase of death cases followed by a slow
decline, which are affected by the earliness and efficiency of the lockdown
effect. These results are in agreement with more accurate calculations using
the extended SIR model with a parametrized solution and more sophisticated
Monte Carlo grid simulations, which predict similar trends and indicate a
common evolution of the pandemic with universal parameters.

of infectious disease require creating and enforcing the appropriate public
policies. One critical policy imposed by the policymakers is encouraging the
population to practice social distancing (i.e. controlling the contact rate
among the population). Here we pose a mean-field game model of individuals each
choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of gaining
utility but also risking infection from additional contacts. We compute and
compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes each
individual acting selfishly to maximize its own utility, to the socially
optimal strategy, which maximizes the total utility of the population. We prove
that the optimal decision of the infected is always to make more contacts than
the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the important
role of public policy to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining,
sick paid leave). Additionally, we include cost to incentivize people to change
strategies, when computing the socially optimal strategies. We find that with
this cost, policies reducing contacts of the infected should be further
enforced after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the
price of anarchy (PoA) of this system, to understand the conditions under which
large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise,
which is when intervening public policy would be most effective.

individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed
infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered
cases) display a strong agreement with polynomial growth and at a later
epidemic stage also with a combined polynomial growth with exponential decay.
Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical
models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing
the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an
algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where
$T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show
how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic
data and estimate some epidemic parameters. Note that although the model shows
a good agreement with the reported data we do not make any claims about the

  behavior change, and disease transmission","Motivated by the importance of individual differences in risk perception and
behavior change in people's responses to infectious disease outbreaks
(particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we propose a heterogeneous
Disease-Behavior-Information (hDBI) transmission model, in which people's risk
of getting infected is influenced by information diffusion, behavior change,
and disease transmission. We use both a mean-field approximation and Monte
Carlo simulations to analyze the dynamics of the model. Information diffusion
influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and
adopt self-protection, and subsequently affects disease transmission by
changing the actual infection rate. Results show that (a) awareness plays a
central role in epidemic prevention; (b) a reasonable fraction of
""over-reacting"" nodes are needed in epidemic prevention; (c) R0 has different
effects on epidemic outbreak for cases with and without asymptomatic infection;
(d) social influence on behavior change can remarkably decrease the epidemic
outbreak size. This research indicates that the media and opinion leaders
should not understate the transmissibility and severity of diseases to ensure
that people could become aware of the disease and adopt self-protection to
protect themselves and the whole population.

  to estimate the total cases from medical swabs data?","During the current Covid-19 pandemic in Italy, official data are collected
with medical swabs following a pure convenience criterion which, at least in an
early phase, has privileged the exam of patients showing evident symptoms.
However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients
(e. g. Aguilar et al., 2020; Chugthai et al, 2020; Li, et al., 2020; Mizumoto
et al., 2020a, 2020b and Yelin et al., 2020). In this situation, in order to
estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it
should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it
would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw
sound probabilistic inference. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total
prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time
series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic
in earlier time (Brogi et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose to estimate the
prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data
published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\`a so as to obtain a more
representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure
commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a
distribution which is more similar to the population (Valliant et al., 2018).
In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order
to derive the weights necessary for reweighting them using age and gender as
post-stratification variables thus obtaining more reliable estimation of
prevalence and lethality.

  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics? A critical assessment through the case of
  Italy","As the COVID-19 outbreak is developing the two most frequently reported
statistics seem to be the raw confirmed case and case fatalities counts.
Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two
values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread.
In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would
be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction
of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region)
generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region)
15th-22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing
trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not
representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort.
This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests
and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model
parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed
case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also
fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone
to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the
national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are
taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official
data of total death counts up to 15th April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to
10th May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work we do not fit models but we
rather investigate whether this task is possible at all. This work also informs
about a new tool to collect and harmonize official statistics coming from
different sources in the form of a package for the R statistical environment

However, there are still many difficulties in identifying drug applications

Italy particularly hard, yielding the implementation of strict national
lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad
on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown
(Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting
scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other
nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can
independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service.
In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is
essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to
design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve
this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each
region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using
the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national
lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the
spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also
propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be
effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the
epidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and
mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to
other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states

  Optimizing Covid-19 Pandemic Government Actions","Whenever countries are threatened by a pandemic, as is the case with the
COVID-19 virus, governments should take the right actions to safeguard public
health as well as to mitigate the negative effects on the economy. In this
regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a
restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously
damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may
put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be
somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is
necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other
measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible -
Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the
evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the
best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with
two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic
Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter
distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system
focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that
hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding
taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage
to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid
tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of
a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep
Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the
sequences of actions.

  measures","In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of
asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to
contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the
population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by
separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep
working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group
consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to
quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.
In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of
contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in
time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an
explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms
of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we
can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the
epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic
scenarios. From the expression of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we
conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic
cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these
measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved.
Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce

  counts in the United States","As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves, accurate forecasting continues to play an
extremely important role in informing policy decisions. In this paper, we
present our continuous curation of a large data repository containing COVID-19
information from a range of sources. We use this data to develop predictions
and corresponding prediction intervals for the short-term trajectory of
COVID-19 cumulative death counts at the county-level in the United States up to
two weeks ahead. Using data from January 22 to June 20, 2020, we develop and
combine multiple forecasts using ensembling techniques, resulting in an
ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our
individual predictors include county-specific exponential and linear
predictors, a shared exponential predictor that pools data together across
counties, an expanded shared exponential predictor that uses data from
neighboring counties, and a demographics-based shared exponential predictor. We
use prediction errors from the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our
death predictions, resulting in generally-applicable prediction intervals,
Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction Intervals (MEPI). MEPI achieves a coverage
rate of more than 94% when averaged across counties for predicting cumulative
recorded death counts two weeks in the future. Our forecasts are currently
being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the
medical supply need for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to
the distribution of medical supplies across the country. We hope that our
forecasts and data repository at https://covidseverity.com can help guide
necessary county-specific decision-making and help counties prepare for their
continued fight against COVID-19.

essential prerequisite for appropriate crisis management during adverse health

primary responsibility of risk management is not centralized to a single

Twitter data in descriptive or predictive context during COVID-19 pandemic,
causal modeling of public attention has not been investigated. In this study,
we propose a causal inference approach to discover and quantify causal
relationships between pandemic characteristics (e.g. number of infections and
deaths) and Twitter activity as well as public sentiment. Our results show that
the proposed method can successfully capture the epidemiological domain
knowledge and identify variables that affect public attention and sentiment. We
believe our work contributes to the field of infodemiology by distinguishing
events that correlate with public attention from events that cause public
attention.

potential hits that can inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the
published literature on medicinal importance, total 154 phytochemicals with
analogous structure from limonoids and triterpenoids were selected to search
potential inhibitors for the five therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2,
i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), SGp-RBD (spike
glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and
ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The in silico computational results
revealed that the phytochemicals such as glycyrrhizic acid, limonin,
7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, maslinic acid, corosolic acid, obacunone and
ursolic acid were found to be effective against the target proteins of
SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that these
phytochemicals bind with the amino acid residues at the active site of the
target proteins. Therefore, the core structure of these potential hits can be
used for further lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the
medicinal plants containing these phytochemicals like licorice, neem, tulsi,
citrus and olives can be used to formulate suitable therapeutic approaches in
traditional medicines.

isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on
tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and
only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of
the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests
for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the
outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions
emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded)
relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is
unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on
the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists
no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring
or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing
policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any
second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is
within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and
tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000
tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for
which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative
analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent
serological studies.

  case study","An epidemiological model is developed for the spread of COVID-19 in South
Africa. A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP
model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global
COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the
SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South
Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their
peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by
when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then
used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the
initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability
of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently
recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values.
The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be
reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the
number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October
2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to
90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are
heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence
to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly
sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The
future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South
African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying
lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.

allows for the discovery of themes in the expression of negative sentiment by
these tweets. Under this public health crisis of human beings, this stage-based
approach enables us to provide policy suggestions for the enactment of

caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Due
to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems
are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of
SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical
ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on
healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we
study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and
based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to
receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care.
To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a
retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of
5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models
identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a

outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and its usefulness in combating the pandemic is a
proven fact. There have been many advancements in the design of a face mask and
the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile
triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of
SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in
which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one
is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and
electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in
inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five
pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon - polyester, cotton - polyester,
poly(methyl methacrylate) - PVDF, lylon - PVDF and polypropylene - polyester
have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective tribo-electric
charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m2, respectively.
This smart mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple
mechanism, self-driven (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities,

effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be potentially
beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.

as we resort to minimize the spread through preventive measures such as social
distancing and quarantine. An increasingly worrying aspect is the gap between
the exponential disease spread and the delay in adopting preventive measures.
This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its
preventive measures. Nowadays, social media platforms (ie., Twitter) are
frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In
this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19
by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that,
we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most
affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related
trends, 2) the volume of tweets and recurring topics in those trends, and 3)
the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries
with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to
expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also
observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated
before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive
attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in
countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19
preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social
media usage can influence public behavior, which can be leveraged to better
combat future pandemics.

an assurance case, which is a structured argument supported by evidence with
the aim to assess how confident we should be in our risk-based decisions. We
argue that any COVID-19 simulation model that is used to guide critical policy
decisions would benefit from being supported with such a case to explain how,
and to what extent, the evidence from the simulation can be relied on to
substantiate policy conclusions. This would enable a critical review of the
implicit assumptions and inherent uncertainty in modelling, and would give the

has emerged as the preferred voting method during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence
in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these
systems.

health institutions around the world. Contact tracing is an essential tool to
change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Manual contact tracing of Covid-19
cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health
authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact
tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm.
Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more
privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without
concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit
corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations
of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty
into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk
can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant
information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform
epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor.
These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors
involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate
and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical
and economic productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile
apps and machine learning should proactively mitigate potential ethical and
privacy risks, which could have substantial impacts on society (not only
impacts on health but also impacts such as stigmatization and abuse of personal
data). Here, we present an overview of the rationale, design, ethical
considerations and privacy strategy of `COVI,' a Covid-19 public peer-to-peer
contact tracing and risk awareness mobile application developed in Canada.

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is rapidly spreading across the globe.
The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically
ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical
environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of
contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in
on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to
continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their
quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels).
Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new
routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has
created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively
monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of
remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the
pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common
ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic
on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.

  disease risk and severity' and how causal Bayesian networks both expose and
  resolve the problem","An important recent preprint by Griffith et al highlights how 'collider bias'
in studies of COVID19 undermines our understanding of the disease risk and
severity. This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who
have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are
overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being
underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results
that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of
Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret
observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved
using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that
there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which,
unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in
this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset
and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely
that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases
the risk of COVID19. Indeed, ""being in close contact with COVID19 people""
reduces the risk of COVID19. To avoid such potentially erroneous conclusions,
any analysis of observational data must take account of the underlying causal
structure including colliders and confounders. If analysts fail to do this
explicitly then any conclusions they make about the effect of specific risk
factors on COVID19 are likely to be flawed.

predicting the Italian peak of the epidemic in April 2020 with about 100.000

  for protection against COVID-19 virus -- implications for mask design and
  usage","The use of face masks for the general public has been suggested in literature
as a means to decrease virus transmission during the global COVID-19 pandemic.
However, literature findings indicate that most mask designs do not provide
reliable protection. This paper investigates the hypothesis that the impaired
protection is mainly due to imperfect fitting of the masks, so that airflow,
which contains virus-transporting droplets, can leak through gaps into or out
of the mask. The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical
and numerical computations. The results demonstrate that the flow can be
satisfactorily predicted by simplified analytical 1D-flow models, by efficient
2D-flow simulations and by 3D-flow simulations. The present results show that
already gap heights larger than 0.1mm can result in the mask not fulfilling
FFP2 or FFP3 standards, and for gap heights of ca. 1mm most of the airflow and
droplets may pass through the gap. The implications of these findings are
discussed and improvements to existing mask designs are suggested.

  evaluating nonpharmaceutical interventions with an application to COVID-19 in
  Iowa","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmingly demonstrated the need to
accurately evaluate the effects of implementing new or altering existing
nonpharmaceutical interventions. Since these interventions applied at the
societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means,
public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and
mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are
typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most
epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been
shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative
approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive
and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of
expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know
the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window
using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM
designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions. By utilizing recursive
relationships, our method can quickly compute the expected epidemiological
outcomes even for large populations based on any arbitrary contact network. We
utilize our methods to evaluate the effects of relaxing current social

relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals

Traditional methods for observing these historical events are difficult because

The network cameras can continuously provide real-time visual data (image and

have been studied. Our analysis showed a 13.14 Percentage increase in cases
before lockdown which drops down to 6.55 percent during the lockdown. It proved
the effectiveness of lockdown. However, the Percentage Increase in case grows
up to 7.24 during a smart lockdown. If it continues to rise in this manner,
Pakistan may need to enter again into a strict second lockdown.

for predicting the Covid 19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced
countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this
approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting
preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are
somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial
clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the
pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered
features representing a country response to the early spread of the pandemic. A
Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to
predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to
estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve
fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution
that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks
of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil,
with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the
19th of May 2020. Predicted numbers reach a total of 240 thousand infected
Brazilians, distributed among the different states, with S\~ao Paulo leading
with almost 65 thousands estimated, confirmed cases. The estimated end of the

  interventions using compartment models: the PyRoss library","PyRoss is an open-source Python library that offers an integrated platform
for inference, prediction and optimisation of NPIs in age- and
contact-structured epidemiological compartment models. This report outlines the
rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations
and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss
library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as
master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run
transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental
subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and
allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and
forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as
available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be
weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact
of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological
data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to
optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are
included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed
populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments
structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes
relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such
compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be
combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,
could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to
detailed epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for
research to address today's COVID-19 crisis, and to plan for future pandemics.

  transmissibility and social distancing measures","A number of models in mathematical epidemiology have been developed to
account for control measures such as vaccination or quarantine. However,
COVID-19 has brought unprecedented social distancing measures, with a challenge
on how to include these in a manner that can explain the data, but avoid
overfitting in parameter inference. We here develop a simple non-homologous
model, where social distancing effects are introduced analogous to course
grained models of gene expression control in systems biology. We apply our
approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection and fatality
counts (observed between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland China provinces),
which we explain through interplay of transmissibility and effective protection
differences. That is, we obtain a negative feedback (also commonly encountered
in systems biology) between transmissibility and effects of social distancing,
with Hubei being an outlier with both large transmissibility and lower social
distancing effects. While Case Fatality Rate is significantly larger for Hubei,
we find that Infection Fatality Rates (IFRs) are much more uniform/consistent
across all the provinces. Even for Wuhan, our inferred Infection Attack Rate is
much below the herd immunity threshold, raising a major reemission risk. The
obtained results demonstrate applicability of our developed method to extract
key infection parameters directly from the data (publicly available for a
number of countries), so that it can be applied globally to potential future
outbreaks of COVID-19, or other infectious diseases.

  Main Protease","The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new
virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease
Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies
have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro
inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a
glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly
attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than
that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying
on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a
molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.
Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the
catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a
second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region
localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of
the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this
second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic
site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains
exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access
through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and
reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could
interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings
provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro
inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic
strategies for COVID-19.

out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control

limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by
18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and
wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a
non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed
countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather
effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors

reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to
restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe

widespread reports of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care

current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals,

countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.
This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data
performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR
test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for
handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential
workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to
predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or
results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow
fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed
models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with
high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in
an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on
hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is
significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed,
compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and
other critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from
widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR

seventeen million people and had spread to almost all countries worldwide. In
response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to
reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of
schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social
distancing, including local and national lockdowns. We use a Monte-Carlo (MC)
based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population
densities using the most recent epidemic data in our work. We test the spread
of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various
combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each
model and constraint. In this paper, we have tested three different time-cyclic
patterns of no-restrictions/lockdown patterns. This model's main prediction is
that a cyclic schedule of no-restrictions/lockdown that contains at least ten
days of lockdown for each time cycle can help control the virus infection. In

established or legacy media systems. Sometimes they reinforce each other, but

Limited testing capacity across the country has been widely identified as a key
driver of suppressed coronavirus case-counts. The calls to increase testing
capacity are well-justified as they become a more frequent point of discussion
in the public sphere. While expanded testing is a laudable goal, selection bias
will impact estimates of disease prevalence and the effective reproduction
number until the entire population is sampled. Moreover, tests are imperfect as
false positive/negative rates interact in complex ways with selection bias. In
this paper, we attempt to clarify this interaction. Through simple
calculations, we demonstrate pitfalls and paradoxes that can arise when

  economy?","We analyse the economics and epidemiology of different scenarios for a phased
restart of the UK economy. Our economic model is designed to address the unique
features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both
supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting
economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to
model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts
conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry
are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also
includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption.
We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of
production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects,
and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few
industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and
contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the
transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening
scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the
increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that
yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in
economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer
facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare,
and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.

  Distancing Policies in Brazil","The global COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defining health crisis
of our century. Due to the absence of vaccines and drugs that can help to fight
it, the world solution to control the spread has been to consider public social
distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this
context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine
the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in
the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number
of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the
absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic
individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an
uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and
inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model
an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to
the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the
speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical
formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or
the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to
avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation
results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These
results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August
2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the
beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days.
This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of
infections, which has a forecast to the beginning of October, can be reduced if
the periods of no-isolation days are shortened.

active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images,

train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest

X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,
we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the
robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.

  risk and spread","Most models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for
COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the
infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact
occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely
to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here,
we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that
many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic
size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees
(""risk"" and ""spread""), including their heterogeneity and the correlation
between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate
why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard
Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models
where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that
some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of
individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend
not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we
point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both
for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent
superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and
backward version of the classic ""friendship paradox"" -- forward links tend to
lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals
with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward
contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future
cascades of infection.

debate around contact tracing apps -- the tech-enabled response to the
pandemic. As corporations, academics, governments, and civil society discuss
the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit
assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet
access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to
install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential
exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this
work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough
smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight
a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the
elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially
distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest
risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are
already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn
about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and
corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios
where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy. In
this work we call for a comprehensive and equitable policy response that
prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, protects human rights, and
considers long term impact instead of focusing on technology-first fixes.

epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical
interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new
phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed
cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain
by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until
herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new
cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the
structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate
there exists a critical number of social contacts, $D_c$, below which linear
growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above $D_c$ traditional
epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When
calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission
rate and the number of days being contagious, we find $D_c\sim 7.2$. Assuming
realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown
measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual
infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of
parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one
country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a
severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard
compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The
probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.

disruptions. Here we report the results of a survey of approximately 4,500
Principal Investigators (PIs) at U.S.- and Europe-based research institutions.
Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how
scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research
output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals'
characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on
average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share
reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to
field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most
negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists
reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics
examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved
dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines
similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can
account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce
evidence about the role of parenting in scientists' work, these results
highlight the fundamental and heterogeneous ways this pandemic is affecting the
scientific workforce, and may have broad relevance for shaping responses to the
pandemic's effect on science and beyond.

one of the standard models of disease spreading. Here we analyse an extended
SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an
important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of
analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of
infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected
population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions
for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time
exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the
linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention
strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The
two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive
number, $R_0$, to a target value $R^{\rm target}_0 < 1$, but in distinct ways,
which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same $R^{\rm
target}_0 < 1$, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD.
However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our
study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new
cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised
dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre-
and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. We apply
our results to the COVID data for India to obtain heuristic projections for the
course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend on the
assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.

more pressing than ever. Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive (potentially
bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we
present a severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal
chest X-ray images. Such a tool can gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections
(and pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of
care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU.
  Methods: Images from a public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively
by three blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as
the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large
(non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19
images which are predictive for our task.
  Results: This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the
outputs from an this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic
extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung
opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE.
  Conclusions: These results indicate that our model's ability to gauge
severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used for escalation or
de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in
the intensive care unit (ICU). A proper clinical trial is needed to evaluate
efficacy. To enable this we make our code, labels, and data available online at

act swiftly to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, their effectiveness is
heavily dependent on their installation rate, which may be influenced by
people's perceptions of the utility of these apps and any potential privacy
risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user
identity and location). In this paper, we present a survey study that examined
people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after
informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a
U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs
covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic
contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our
analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals.
  Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of
people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server
for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority
to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to
infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our
sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations
in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps
using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic
contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as
hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the

  and Mobility via Passive WiFi Sensing","Mobile sensing has played a key role in providing digital solutions to aid
with COVID-19 containment policies. These solutions include, among other
efforts, enforcing social distancing and monitoring crowd movements in indoor
spaces. However, such solutions may not be effective without mass adoption. As
more and more countries reopen from lockdowns, there remains a pressing need to
minimize crowd movements and interactions, particularly in enclosed spaces.
This paper conjectures that analyzing user occupancy and mobility via deployed
WiFi infrastructure can help institutions monitor and maintain safety
compliance according to the public health guidelines. Using smartphones as a
proxy for user location, our analysis demonstrates how coarse-grained WiFi data
can sufficiently reflect indoor occupancy spectrum when different COVID-19
policies were enacted. Our work analyzes staff and students' mobility data from
three different university campuses. Two of these campuses are in Singapore,
and the third is in the Northeastern United States. Our results show that
online learning, split-team, and other space management policies effectively
lower occupancy. However, they do not change the mobility for individuals
transitioning between spaces. We demonstrate how this data source can be put to
practical application for institutional crowd control and discuss the
implications of our findings for policy-making.

coronavirus 2, emerged into a world being rapidly transformed by artificial
intelligence (AI) based on big data, computational power and neural networks.
The gaze of these networks has in recent years turned increasingly towards
applications in healthcare. It was perhaps inevitable that COVID-19, a global
disease propagating health and economic devastation, should capture the
attention and resources of the world's computer scientists in academia and
industry. The potential for AI to support the response to the pandemic has been
proposed across a wide range of clinical and societal challenges, including
disease forecasting, surveillance and antiviral drug discovery. This is likely
to continue as the impact of the pandemic unfolds on the world's people,
industries and economy but a surprising observation on the current pandemic has
been the limited impact AI has had to date in the management of COVID-19. This
correspondence focuses on exploring potential reasons behind the lack of
successful adoption of AI models developed for COVID-19 diagnosis and
prognosis, in front-line healthcare services. We highlight the moving clinical
needs that models have had to address at different stages of the epidemic, and
explain the importance of translating models to reflect local healthcare
environments. We argue that both basic and applied research are essential to
accelerate the potential of AI models, and this is particularly so during a
rapidly evolving pandemic. This perspective on the response to COVID-19, may
provide a glimpse into how the global scientific community should react to
combat future disease outbreaks more effectively.

important when fighting the exponential nature of an epidemic. We develop a

COVID-19 takes place in different countries in the world, with which only big
data application and the work of NOSQL databases are suitable. There is a great
number of platforms used for processing NOSQL Databases model like: Spark, H2O
and Hadoop HDFS/MapReduce, which are proper to control and manage the enormous
amount of data. Many challenges faced by large applications programmers,
especially those that work on the COVID-19 databases through hybrid data models
through different APIs and query. In this context, this paper proposes a
storage framework to handle both SQL and NOSQL databases named (COVID-QF) for
COVID-19 datasets in order to treat and handle the problems caused by virus
spreading worldwide by reducing treatment times. In case of NoSQL database,
COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of
three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer.
The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides
data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the
Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving
and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends
results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for

privacy-preserving proximity tracing at large scale. This system, referred to
as DP3T, provides a technological foundation to help slow the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 by simplifying and accelerating the process of notifying people who
might have been exposed to the virus so that they can take appropriate measures
to break its transmission chain. The system aims to minimise privacy and
security risks for individuals and communities and guarantee the highest level
of data protection. The goal of our proximity tracing system is to determine
who has been in close physical proximity to a COVID-19 positive person and thus
exposed to the virus, without revealing the contact's identity or where the
contact occurred. To achieve this goal, users run a smartphone app that
continually broadcasts an ephemeral, pseudo-random ID representing the user's
phone and also records the pseudo-random IDs observed from smartphones in close
proximity. When a patient is diagnosed with COVID-19, she can upload
pseudo-random IDs previously broadcast from her phone to a central server.
Prior to the upload, all data remains exclusively on the user's phone. Other
users' apps can use data from the server to locally estimate whether the
device's owner was exposed to the virus through close-range physical proximity
to a COVID-19 positive person who has uploaded their data. In case the app
detects a high risk, it will inform the user.

  Slovenia?","A recent work (DOI 10.1101/2020.05.06.20093310) indicated that temporarily
splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterwards, on May 15, 2020,
the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the
end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this
perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper we investigate the time
dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia with emphasis on how efficient
various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections.
Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical
assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results
presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while
imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate
kappa by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only
improve the \k{appa}-value by ~15 % as compared to the much bearable state of
social and economical life wherein (justifiable) wearing face masks and social
distancing rules are enforced/followed. Significantly for behavioral and social
science, our analysis of the time dependence \k{appa} = \k{appa}(t) may reveal
an interesting self-protection instinct of the population, which became
manifest even before the official lockdown enforcement.

  correcting delay-induced errors in the assessment of COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped our world in a timescale much shorter than
what we can understand. Particularities of SARS-CoV-2, such as its persistence
in surfaces and the lack of a curative treatment or vaccine against COVID-19,
have pushed authorities to apply restrictive policies to control its spreading.
As data drove most of the decisions made in this global contingency, their
quality is a critical variable for decision-making actors, and therefore should
be carefully curated. In this work, we analyze the sources of error in
typically reported epidemiological variables and usual tests used for
diagnosis, and their impact on our understanding of COVID-19 spreading
dynamics. We address the existence of different delays in the report of new
cases, induced by the incubation time of the virus and testing-diagnosis time
gaps, and other error sources related to the sensitivity/specificity of the
tests used to diagnose COVID-19. Using a statistically-based algorithm, we
perform a temporal reclassification of cases to avoid delay-induced errors,
building up new epidemiologic curves centered in the day where the contagion
effectively occurred. We also statistically enhance the robustness behind the
discharge/recovery clinical criteria in the absence of a direct test, which is
typically the case of non-first world countries, where the limited testing
capabilities are fully dedicated to the evaluation of new cases. Finally, we
applied our methodology to assess the evolution of the pandemic in Chile
through the Effective Reproduction Number $R_t$, identifying different moments
in which data was misleading governmental actions. In doing so, we aim to raise
public awareness of the need for proper data reporting and processing protocols

known about how racial hate spreads during a pandemic and the role of
counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and
spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create
COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning
three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over
87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we
train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves
an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate
tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find
that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to
their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards
compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful
users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot
accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers
compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that
hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another,
instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that
hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being
exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate
messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place. Overall,

is the key protection factor against COVID-19. Social distancing alone should
have been enough to protect again the virus, yet things have gone very
differently, with a big mismatch between theory and practice. What are the
reasons? A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and
the corresponding people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the
world-first dataset on social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to
see for the first time how people really implement social distancing, identify
dangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future
pandemics.
  Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social
distance data from people in Italy for over two months during the most critical
COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated if and how wearing various
Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.
  Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous
strategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of
social distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the
paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior. In
shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without
filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should
be recommended for general use, as they give an extra powerful safety boost.
Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work well on social
distancing: explicit focus on the behavioral problems of necessary mobility are
needed.

in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much
public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus

solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or
slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social
distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of
social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing
down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be
minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every
individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can
minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be
found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large
class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social
sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes
many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and
can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or
allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible
distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and
analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different
contact values are assigned to different network sites.

  COVID-19: an agent-based approach","Touristic cities will suffer from COVID-19 emergency because of its economic
impact on their communities. The first emergency phases involved a wide closure
of such areas to support ""social distancing"" measures (i.e. travels limitation;
lockdown of (over)crowd-prone activities). In the second phase, individual's
risk-mitigation strategies (facial masks) could be properly linked to ""social
distancing"" to ensure re-opening touristic cities to visitors. Simulation tools
could support the effectiveness evaluation of risk-mitigation measures to look
for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work
modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in
touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and
virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated
proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included
according to international health organizations and previous calibration
through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as ""social
distancing""-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask
implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e.
initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant
case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare
the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that ""social distancing""
seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents
an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full
effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and
individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model
could be integrated to consider other recurring issues on tourist-related
fruition and schedule of urban spaces and facilities (e.g. cultural/leisure
buildings).

  scoring of chest X-rays for SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity","Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the assessment
of the severity of disease progression. Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to
assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two important assessment metrics being extent
of lung involvement and degree of opacity. In this proof-of-concept study, we
assess the feasibility of computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung
disease severity using a deep learning system.
  Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 396 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2 positive
patient cases. Geographic extent and opacity extent were scored by two
board-certified expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of experience) and a
2nd-year radiology resident. The deep neural networks used in this study, which
we name COVIDNet-S, are based on a COVID-Net network architecture. 100 versions
of the network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic extent
scoring and 50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets of CXRs
from the study, and evaluated the networks using stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments.
  Findings: The COVIDNet-S deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.664 $\pm$
0.001 and 0.635 $\pm$ 0.002 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for
geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively, in stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved R$^2$ of
0.739 and 0.741 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic
extent and opacity extent, respectively.
  Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that the use of deep
neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are
needed before adoption for routine clinical use.

essential tool for managing the epidemic. App-based solutions have emerged for
Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced

well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked
as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked

requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no
cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan
Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel
""cross hashing"" approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure
durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected
individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been
exposed using $k$-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection. We
empirically demonstrate that this modified protocol can offer like-for-like
efficacy to the existing protocol.

those who had mild or no symptoms and thus were not captured by any medical

further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health
informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the
fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a
groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial
sectors, and medical imaging.
  The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying
disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to
common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases,
and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the
healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data
related for the reasons stated above.
  Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to
be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly
reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the
properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms
(unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly
transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.
  We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in
2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and
we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data
modelling, and reproducibility.

the population infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. To
capture heterogeneity in the population and the effect of interventions to
reduce the rate of epidemic spread, the model uses a time-varying contact rate,
whose logarithm has a Gaussian process prior. A Poisson point process is used
to model the occurrence of deaths due to COVID-19 and the model is calibrated
using data of daily death counts in combination with a snapshot of the the
proportion of individuals with an active infection, performed in Stockholm in
late March. The methodology is applied to regions in Sweden. The results show
that the estimated proportion of the population who has been infected is around
13.5% in Stockholm, by 2020-05-15, and ranges between 2.5% - 15.6% in the other
investigated regions. In Stockholm where the peak of daily death counts is
likely behind us, parameter uncertainty does not heavily influence the expected
daily number of deaths, nor the expected cumulative number of deaths. It does,
however, impact the estimated cumulative number of infected individuals. In the
other regions, where random sampling of the number of active infections is not
available, parameter sharing is used to improve estimates, but the parameter
uncertainty remains substantial.

disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable
drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity
ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor
complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to
provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in
M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed
by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding
inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL
has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$)
being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated
SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which
endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present
binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition
offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts.

  Pandemic-Enabled Neoclassical Growth Model","During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2019/2020, authorities have used temporary
ad-hoc policy measures, such as lockdowns and mass quarantines, to slow its
transmission. However, the consequences of widespread use of these
unprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the
understanding of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures,
we therefore construct a mathematical model of an economy under the impact of a
pandemic, select parameter values to represent the global economy under the
impact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large
number of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy
intervention in the simulated scenarios, we find that the most effective policy
intervention occurs around the time when the number of active infections is
growing at its highest rate -- that is, the results suggest that the most
severe measures should only be implemented when the disease is sufficiently
spread. The intensity of the intervention, above a certain threshold, does not
appear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations, due to the
strongly concave relationship that we identify between production shortfall and
infection rate reductions. Our experiments further suggest that the
intervention should last until after the peak established by the reduced
infection rate, which implies that stricter policies should last longer. The
model and its implementation, along with the general insights from our policy
experiments, may help policymakers design effective emergency policy responses
in the face of a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding of the
relationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.

This paper demonstrates how evolutionary AI could be used to facilitate the

is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate
them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for
different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic
and the need to minimize their economic impact. While still limited by
available data, early experiments suggest that workplace and school
restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. It also
demonstrates that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and
suggests creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g. by
alternating them over time. As more data becomes available, the approach can be
increasingly useful in dealing with COVID-19 as well as possible future

unprecedented example of how fast an infectious disease can spread around the
globe (especially in urban areas) and the enormous impact it causes on public
health and socio-economic activities. Despite the recent surge of
investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know
little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in
urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19
scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate small towns
are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of the
disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita
initially decrease with population size. However, during the long-term course
of the pandemic, this urban advantage vanishes and large cities start to
exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1% rise in
population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per
capita after about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that
these patterns may be related to the existence of proportionally more health
infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in
large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to
be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in
large cities and to increase in small ones over time.

next years. However the pathology in humans is so recent that many clinical
aspects, like early detection of complications, side effects after recovery or
early screening, are currently unknown. In spite of the number of cases of
COVID-19, its rapid spread putting many sanitary systems in the edge of
collapse has hindered proper collection and analysis of the data related to
COVID-19 clinical aspects. We describe an interdisciplinary initiative that
integrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and the use of new
technologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of
clarifying some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3
main points: 1) collection of standardize data including images, clinical data
and analytics; 2) COVID-19 screening for its early diagnosis at primary care
centers; 3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and associated
pathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this
paper we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and
first results of X-ray COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG
and feature selection. Our experiments include a comparison to some recent
methods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis of the
feasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches
can outperform deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the
feasibility of early COVID-19 screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the
group of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms of radiological description
of X-ray. Therefore, an efficient COVID-19 screening should be complemented
with other clinical data to better discriminate these cases.

inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of
parameters, making it crucial to compute the probability of each result. To
simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we
call {best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine is the
best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we
show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very
effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the
likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long quarantines of relatively low
intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce its size
considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than
complete lockdown for short periods.

transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and
shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes

nationally mandating face masks for employees on April 1st could have reduced
the growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late
April, and could have led to as much as 17 to 55 percent less deaths nationally

Our estimates imply that removing non-essential business closures (while
maintaining school closures, restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants)

also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 25

been infected if stay-at-home orders had not been implemented. Finally, not

dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in
social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular,
if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing
measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of
September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to
somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000
tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept
at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly
must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress
excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the ""pre-Pause"" social
distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number
of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be
performing 500,000 tests per day. Our findings have important implications on

toward the epidemic. Due to the real-time and large-scale nature of social
media, we can continuously obtain a massive amount of public opinion
information related to the epidemic from social media. In particular,
researchers may ask questions such as ""how is the public reacting to COVID-19
in China during different stages of the pandemic?"", ""what factors affect the
public opinion orientation in China?"", and so on. To answer such questions, we
analyze the pandemic related public opinion information on Weibo, China's
largest social media platform. Specifically, we have first collected a large
amount of COVID-19-related public opinion microblogs. We then use a sentiment
classifier to recognize and analyze different groups of users' opinions. In the
collected sentiment orientated microblogs, we try to track the public opinion
through different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we analyze more
key factors that might have an impact on the public opinion of COVID-19 (e.g.,
users in different provinces or users with different education levels).
Empirical results show that the public opinions vary along with the key factors
of COVID-19. Furthermore, we analyze the public attitudes on different
public-concerning topics, such as staying at home and quarantine.

  Epidemic using Robust Multi-objective Optimization and Stochastic Fractal
  Search","Traditionally, the identification of parameters in the formulation and
solution of inverse problems considers that models, variables and mathematical
parameters are free of uncertainties. This aspect simplifies the estimation
process, but does not consider the influence of relatively small changes in the
design variables in terms of the objective function. In this work, the SIDR
(Susceptible, Infected, Dead and Recovered) model is used to simulate the
dynamic behavior of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and its
parameters are estimated by formulating a robust inverse problem, that is,
considering the sensitivity of design variables. For this purpose, a robust
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated, considering the
minimization of uncertainties associated to the estimation process and the
maximization of the robustness parameter. To solve this problem, the
Multi-objective Stochastic Fractal Search algorithm is associated with the
Effective Mean concept for the evaluation of robustness. The results obtained
considering real data of the epidemic in China demonstrate that the evaluation
of the sensitivity of the design variables can provide more reliable results.

  Drugs","As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, researchers are reporting findings of
randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental
drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects
are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may
find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs.
Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that
random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal
treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an
innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect
is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard
care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of
near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of
decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the
empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed
average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and
ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields
treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by
prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.

it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer

inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here,
we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indian
medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and
cathepsin L. We built a homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentally
determined structure is not available. AutoDock Vina was used to perform
molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 model structure and
cathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered
by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and
non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were used as an additional filter to
identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with
residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We have
identified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among
phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are
Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol.
Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors
have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further in
vitro and in vivo testing is needed before clinical trials of the promising

  assimilation and forecasting for the United Kingdom","We introduce a deterministic model that partitions the total population into
the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and those traced after exposure, the
recovered and the deceased. We hypothesize 'accessible population for
transmission of the disease' to be a small fraction of the total population,
for instance when interventions are in force. This hypothesis, together with
the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations
for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two
equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total
infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore
allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms
of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible
population' hypothesis and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is
demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the cumulative
infected and daily new infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast
further progression of the disease. In an effort to find optimized parameter
values compatible with the United Kingdom coronavirus data, we first determine
the relative importance of the various transition rates participating in the
original model. Using this we show that the original model equations provide a
very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of
infections and the daily new cases. The fact that the model calculated daily
new cases exhibits a turning point, suggests the beginning of a slow-down in
the spread of infections. However, since the rate of slowing down beyond the
turning point is small, the cumulative number of infections is likely to
saturate to about $3.52 \times 10^5$ around late July, provided the lock-down
conditions continue to prevail.

critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to
identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and
drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially
effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify these
potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as a
potentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic
discovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first
identified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infection
caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of the
altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway
analysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were
identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT,
IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly
identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of
potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and
reverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in the
prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly
reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. The
results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling
pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for

severe cases. This paper is three-fold: (i) we demystify the high sensitivities
achieved by most recent COVID-19 classification models, (ii) under a close
collaboration with Hospital Universitario Cl\'inico San Cecilio, Granada,
Spain, we built COVIDGR-1.0, a homogeneous and balanced database that includes
all levels of severity, from normal with Positive RT-PCR, Mild, Moderate to
Severe. COVIDGR-1.0 contains 426 positive and 426 negative PA (PosteroAnterior)
CXR views and (iii) we propose COVID Smart Data based Network (COVID-SDNet)
methodology for improving the generalization capacity of COVID-classification
models. Our approach reaches good and stable results with an accuracy of
$97.72\% \pm 0.95 \%$, $86.90\% \pm 3.20\%$, $61.80\% \pm 5.49\%$ in severe,
moderate and mild COVID-19 severity levels (Paper accepted for publication in

the disease began to spread quickly across the world, causing serious health,
social, and economic emergencies. This paper aims to forecast the short to
medium-term incidence of COVID-19 epidemic through the medium of an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, applied to Italy,
Russia, and the USA The analysis is carried out on the number of new daily
confirmed COVID-19 cases, collected by Worldometer website. The best ARIMA
models are Italy (4,2,4), Russia (1,2,1), and the USA (6,2,3). The results show
that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to
stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19
infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively; and iii) Russia
and the USA will require much more time than Italy to drop COVID-19 cases near
zero. This may suggest the importance of the application of quick and effective
lockdown measures, which have been relatively stricter in Italy. Therefore,
even if the results should be interpreted with caution, ARIMA models seem to be
a good tool that can help the health authorities to monitor the diffusion of
the outbreak.

  Clinicians with COVID-19 ECMO Planning","Respiratory complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 have claimed
tens of thousands of lives in 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 escalate from Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) to viral pneumonia to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) to death. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO)
is a life-sustaining oxygenation and ventilation therapy that may be used for
patients with severe ARDS when mechanical ventilation is insufficient to
sustain life. While early planning and surgical cannulation for ECMO can
increase survival, clinicians report the lack of a risk score hinders these
efforts. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop the
PEER score, used to highlight critically ill patients with viral or unspecified
pneumonia at high risk of mortality or decompensation in a subpopulation
eligible for ECMO. The PEER score is validated on two large, publicly available
critical care databases and predicts mortality at least as well as other
existing risk scores. Stratifying our cohorts into low-risk and high-risk
groups, we find that the high-risk group also has a higher proportion of
decompensation indicators such as vasopressor and ventilator use. Finally, the
PEER score is provided in the form of a nomogram for direct calculation of
patient risk, and can be used to highlight at-risk patients among critical care
patients eligible for ECMO.

movement restriction and lockdown periods from 1824 city-dwelling, working
adults aged 21 to 40 years, incorporating 206,381 nights of sleep and 334,038
days of PA. Four distinct rest activity rhythms (RARs) were identified using
k-means clustering of participants' temporally distributed step counts.
Hierarchical clustering of the proportion of time spent in each of these RAR
revealed 4 groups who expressed different mixtures of RAR profiles before and
during the lockdown. Substantial but asymmetric delays in bedtime and waketime
resulted in a 24 min increase in weekday sleep duration with no loss in sleep
efficiency. Resting heart rate declined 2 bpm. PA dropped an average of 38%. 4
groups with different compositions of RAR profiles were found. Three were
better able to maintain PA and weekday/weekend differentiation during lockdown.
The least active group comprising 51 percent of the sample, were younger and
predominantly singles. Habitually less active already, this group showed the
greatest reduction in PA during lockdown with little weekday/weekend
differences. Among different mobility restrictions, removal of habitual social
cues by lockdown had the largest effect on PA and sleep. Sleep and resting
heart rate unexpectedly improved. RAR evaluation uncovered heterogeneity of
responses to lockdown and can identify characteristics of persons at risk of
decline in health and wellbeing.

  Bounds and Limitations","Accurate forecasts for COVID-19 are necessary for better preparedness and
resource management. Specifically, deciding the response over months or several
months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging
as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder
accurate long-term forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases.
While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests
need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of
unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We
show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual
cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our
prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic
cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated
only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct
an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable
bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio
and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to
identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York
City and several US states. Our results demonstrate with high confidence that
the actual number of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times
in Illinois, 38 times in Massachusetts and 29 times in New Jersey, than the
reported cases.

an ideal benchmark for studying phenomena potentially related to polarization
such as misinformation spreading. The combination of these factors may lead to
hate as well as to episodes of harm in the real world. In this work we provide

consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability.
Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social
response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law
distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and
topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users
in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable
posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident
differences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform
such a differentiation thus treating them as a whole. Our results provide
insights toward the understanding of coordinated inauthentic behavior and on

making accurate comparisons between prefectures possible. For the 16
prefectures included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases
exceeding ten, the number of daily confirmed cases follow bell-shape or
log-normal distribution in most prefectures. A good correlation was observed
between the spread and decay durations. However, some exceptions were observed
in areas where travelers returned from foreign countries, which were defined as
the origins of infection clusters. Excluding these prefectures, the population
density was shown to be a major factor affecting the spread and decay patterns,
with R2=0.39 (p<0.05) and 0.42 (p<0.05), respectively, approximately
corresponding to social distancing. The maximum absolute humidity was found to
affect the decay duration normalized by the population density (R2>0.36, p
<0.05). Our findings indicate that the estimated pandemic spread duration,
based on the multivariate analysis of maximum absolute humidity, ambient

deep learning models (ResNet18, ResNet34, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and
DenseNet161) and their Ensemble have been used in this paper, to classify
COVID-19, pneumoni{\ae} and healthy subjects using Chest X-Ray. Multi-label
classification was performed to predict multiple pathologies for each patient,
if present. Foremost, the interpretability of each of the networks was
thoroughly studied using techniques like occlusion, saliency, input X gradient,
guided backpropagation, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT. The mean Micro-F1
score of the models for COVID-19 classifications ranges from 0.66 to 0.875, and
is 0.89 for the Ensemble of the network models. The qualitative results
depicted the ResNets to be the most interpretable model.

convergence of S(t) to a positive limit. These are similar to those of the
classical SIR model, although the maxima of the corresponding curves are not

  from incomplete data","SARS-CoV-2 has disrupted the life of billions of people around the world
since the first outbreak was officially declared in China at the beginning of
2020. Yet, important questions such as how deadly it is or its degree of spread
within different countries remain unanswered. In this work, we exploit the
`universal' growth of the mortality rate with age observed in different
countries since the beginning of their respective outbreaks, combined with the
results of the antibody prevalence tests in the population of Spain, to unveil
both unknowns. We validate these results with an analogous antibody rate survey
in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. We also argue that the official number of
deaths over 70 years old is importantly underestimated in most of the
countries, and we use the comparison between the official records with the
number of deaths mentioning COVID-19 in the death certificates to quantify by
how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio
(IFR) for the different age segments and the fraction of the population
infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all
age segments. We also give estimations for the non-uniform IFR using the
sero-epidemiological results of Spain, showing a very similar growth of the
fatality ratio with age. Only for Spain, we estimate the probability (if
infected) of being identified as a case, being hospitalized or admitted in the
intensive care units as function of age. In general, we observe a nearly
exponential growth of the fatality ratio with age, which anticipates large
differences in total IFR in countries with different demographic distributions,
with numbers that range from 1.82\% in Italy, to 0.62\% in China or even 0.14\%
in middle Africa.

more countries are impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to
contain the spread of the disease, both in countries where the disease is
emerging and in countries that are past the first wave but exposed to
re-emergence. Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing
capabilities but sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management
of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than
RT-PCR and could help in this context.
  Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially
available system and assay (Naica System from Stilla Technologies) and
investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a
university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a
direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into
groups of 3 sizes for RT-dPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16

  Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using
groups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding

individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR

  conditions","The interpretation of sampling data plays a crucial role in policy response
to the spread of a disease during an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 epidemic of
2020. However, this is a non-trivial endeavor due to the complexity of real
world conditions and limits to the availability of diagnostic tests, which
necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough
understanding of sampling confidence and bias is necessary in order make
accurate conclusions. In this manuscript, we provide a stochastic model of
sampling for assessing confidence in disease metrics such as trend detection,
peak detection, and disease spread estimation. Our model simulates testing for
a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo
sampling to assess metric confidence. This model can provide realistic
simulated data which can be used in the design and calibration of data analysis
and prediction methods. As an example, we use this method to show that trends
in the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day,
and an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$
unbiased samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to
assess more advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy
for finding peaks in the dynamics.

to a remote learning that has several drawbacks and has been hurriedly
arranged; in addition, most countries are currently uncertain on how to plan
school activities for the 2020-2021 school year; all of this makes learning and
education some of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic.
Unfortunately, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full
opening of schools seems to be impractical till a vaccine is available. In
order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study a
mathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, and
evaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to school
activities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods. We
consider a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss
function; after a realistic parameter selection, we numerically determine
optimal school opening strategies by simulated annealing. It turns out that
blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote
teaching days or weeks, are generally optimal. Besides containing Covid-19
diffusion, these solutions could be pedagogically acceptable, and could also
become a driving model for the society at large. In a prototypical example, the
optimal strategy results in the school opening 90 days out of 200 with the
number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing
by about 66%, instead of the about 250% increase that would have been a
consequence of full opening.

  after the COVID-19 outbreak before reopening United States","By the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China,
and its rapid outbreak worldwide, the infectious illness has changed our
everyday travel patterns. In this research, our team investigated the changes
in the daily mobility pattern of people during the pandemic by utilizing an
integrated data panel. To incorporate various aspects of human mobility, the
team focused on the Social Distancing Index (SDI) which was calculated based on
five basic mobility measures. The SDI patterns showed a plateau stage in the
beginning of April that lasted for about two weeks. This phenomenon then
followed by a universal decline of SDI, increased number of trips and reduction
in percentage of people staying at home. We called the observation Quarantine
Fatigue. The Rate of Change (ROC) method was employed to trace back the start
date of quarantine fatigue which was indicated to be April 15th. Our analysis
showed that despite the existence of state-to-state variations, most states
started experiencing a quarantine fatigue phenomenon during the same period.
This observation became more important by knowing that none of the states had
officially announced the reopening until late April showing that people decided
to loosen up their social distancing practices before the official reopening
announcement. Moreover, our analysis indicated that official reopening led to a
rapid decline in SDI, raising the concern of a second wave of outbreak. The
synchronized trend among states also emphasizes the importance of a more

  Generation","Beyond the common difficulties faced in the natural image captioning, medical
report generation specifically requires the model to describe a medical image
with a fine-grained and semantic-coherence paragraph that should satisfy both
medical commonsense and logic. Previous works generally extract the global
image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to
referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the
regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area
of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be
considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are
many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal
regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely
to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To
address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge
Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists' working patterns. In more detail,
ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic
information to guide medical knowledge transfer and learning. The core
structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language
decoder, inspired by advanced Generative Pre-Training (GPT). Experiments on the
CX-CHR dataset and our COVID-19 CT Report dataset demonstrate that our proposed
ASGK is able to generate a robust and accurate report, and moreover outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both medical terminology classification and
paragraph generation metrics.

The method is based on a discrete-time stochastic augmented compartmental model
that describes the virus transmission. A two-stage estimation method, which
combines the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate reported state variables
(active and removed cases) and a low pass filter based on a rational transfer
function to remove short term fluctuations of the reported cases, is used with
case uncertainties that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Our
method does not require information regarding serial intervals, which makes the
estimation procedure simpler without reducing the quality of the estimate. We
show that the proposed method is comparable to common approaches, e.g.,
age-structured and new cases based sequential Bayesian models. We also apply it
to COVID-19 cases in the Scandinavian countries: Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,
where we see a delay of about four days in predicting the epidemic peak.

due to the large number of cases worldwide. Imaging of lungs can play a key
role in monitoring of the healthy status. Non-contrast chest computed
tomography (CT) has been used for this purpose, mainly in China, with a
significant success. However, this approach cannot be used massively mainly for
both high risk and cost and in some countries also because this tool is not
extensively available. Alternatively, chest X-ray, although less sensitive than
CT-scan, can provide important information about the evolution of pulmonary
involvement during the disease, this aspect is very important to verify the
response of a patient to treatments. Here, we show how to improve the
sensitivity of chest X-ray via a nonlinear post processing tool, named PACE,
combining properly fast and adaptive bidimensional empirical mode decomposition
and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The results show
an enhancement of the image contrast as confirmed by three widely used metrics:
(i) contrast improvement index, (ii) entropy, and (iii) measure of enhancement.
This improvement gives rise to a detectability of more lung lesions as
identified by two radiologists, which evaluate the images separately, and
confirmed by CT-scans. Based on our findings this method is proved as a
flexible and effective way for medical image enhancement and can be used as a
post-processing step for medical image understanding and analysis.

  Biomedical Imaging","Despite the widespread use of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation
of images that are acquired from a single source, clinicians often use
multi-domain data for a detailed analysis. For instance, CT and MRI have
advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output
characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current
segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to
their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all
modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,
robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training
step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all
available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.
For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can
learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct
and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift
property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where
sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is
used to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed
method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either
training or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in
routine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other
baseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19
dataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual
differences are observed. Similarly, the proposed method achieves the best
performance.

million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in the first quarter (Q1), of 2020 was
recorded, as compared to the same first quarter (Q1), of 2019, due to the
cutback on global economic activities. Our results showed that: 1) electricity
production for the same period in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, shrunk at an
offset of about 9.20%, which resulted in the modest reduction of about
(-1.79%), in the atmospheric CO$_2$, to that of 2017-2018 CO$_2$ level; 2) a
non-seasonal abrupt; but brief, atmospheric CO$_2$ decrease by about 0.85% in
mid-February 2020, could be due to the Phase 1 movement restrictions in China.
The results showed that, the reduction in electricity production is significant
to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO$_2$. It also highlights the
significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO$_2$, which suggests
that, without the national restriction of activities, CO$_2$ concentration are
set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and
sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the
atmospheric CO$_2$ reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved,
if electricity production from combustible sources were slashed, which could be
useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production
from combustible sources, and the impact of these reduction to the atmospheric
CO$_2$.

experienced one of the highest pandemic peaks in Italy. To solve such a
challenging visual task, we adopt a weakly supervised learning strategy
structured to handle different tasks (segmentation, spatial alignment, and
score estimation) trained with a ""from part to whole"" procedure involving
different datasets. In particular, we exploit a clinical dataset of almost
5,000 CXR annotated images collected in the same hospital. Our BS-Net
demonstrates self-attentive behavior and a high degree of accuracy in all
processing stages. Through inter-rater agreement tests and a gold standard
comparison, we show that our solution outperforms single human annotators in
rating accuracy and consistency, thus supporting the possibility of using this
tool in contexts of computer-assisted monitoring. Highly resolved (super-pixel
level) explainability maps are also generated, with an original technique, to
visually help the understanding of the network activity on the lung areas. We
also consider other scores proposed in literature and provide a comparison with
a recently proposed non-specific approach. We eventually test the performance
robustness of our model on a variegated public COVID-19 dataset, for which we
also provide \texttt{Brixia~score} annotations, observing good direct
generalization and fine-tuning capabilities that highlight the portability of
BS-Net in other clinical settings. The CXR dataset along with the source code

model for COVID-19 infection spread through a population based on the SEIR
model where we assume access to (1) mutual contacts between pairs of
individuals across time across various channels (e.g., Bluetooth contact
traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure
and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state
for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed,
infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer
contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm
uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each
individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection
status of all contacts and test outcome data. Experimental results with
simulated data demonstrate our CRISP model can be parametrized by the
reproduction factor $R_0$ and exhibits population-level infectiousness and
recovery time series similar to those of the classical SEIR model. However, due
to the individual contact data, this model allows fine grained control and
inference for a wide range of COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy
measures. Moreover, the algorithm is able to support efficient testing in a
test-trace-isolate approach to contain COVID-19 infection spread. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first model with efficient inference for COVID-19

  SARS-Cov-II using Moyal distribution","In this paper, it is shown that the Moyal distribution is an excelent tool to
study the SARS-Cov-II (Covid-19) epidemiological associated curves and its
propagation. The Moyal parameters give all the information to describe the form
and the impact of the illness outbreak in the different affected countries and
its global impact. We checked that the Moyal distribution can accurately fit
the daily report of {\it{new confirmed cases of infected people}} (NCC) per
country, in that places where the contagion is reaching their final phase,
describing the beginning, the most intense phase and the descend of the
contagion, simultaneously . In order to achieve the purpose of this work, it is
important to work with a complete and well compilated set of the data to be
used to fit the curves. Data from European countries like France, Spain, Italy
Belgium, Sweden, United Kingdom, Denmark and others like USA and China, have
been used. Also, the correlation between the parameters of the Moyal
distribution fitting and the general public health measures imposed in each
country, have been discussed. A relation between those policies and the
features of the Moyal distribution, in terms of their parameters and critical
points, is shown; from that, it can be seen that the knowledge of the time
evolution of the epidemiological curve, their critical points, superposition
properties and rates of the rising and the ending, could help to find a way to
estimate the efficiency of social distancing measures, imposed in each country,
and anticipate the different phases of the pandemic.

  durante a pandemia por COVID-19: Condições necessárias e suficientes?","In a scenario where there is no vaccine for COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical
interventions are necessary to contain the spread of the virus and the collapse
of the health system in the affected regions. One of these measures is social
distancing, which aims to reduce interactions in the community by closing
public and private establishments that involve crowds of people. The lockdown
presupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a more
extreme measure of social distancing. Based on geolocation data provided by
Google for six categories of physical spaces, this article identifies the
variations in the circulation of people in South America for different types of
social distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study,
population mobility trends for a group of countries between February 15, 2020
and May 16, 2020 were analyzed. To summarize these trends in a single metric, a
general circulation index was created, and to identify regional mobility
patterns, descriptive analyzes of spatial autocorrelation (global and local
Moran index) were used. The first hypothesis of this study is that countries
with a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility of
the population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil and
Colombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partially
confirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtained
in the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis. In general, the
observed data shows that less rigid lockdown or social distancing measures are
necessary, however, they are not sufficient to achieve a significant reduction
in the circulation of people during the pandemic.

  Large Multicenter Cohort","Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable
models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other
pneumonias, ILD and normal CTs.
  Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs
from 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing
cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and
559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification
of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and
random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D
features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of
airspace opacities.
  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace
opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the
typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and
control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83,
sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and
0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19
pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild
COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for
other pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness
of our method against different compositions of control groups.
  Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other
types of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging
features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and
classification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis
of COVID-19.

  lung for COVID-19 pneumonia with CT image set","Utilizing computed tomography (CT) images to quickly estimate the severity of
cases with COVID-19 is one of the most straightforward and efficacious methods.
Two tasks were studied in this present paper. One was to segment the mask of
intact lung in case of pneumonia. Another was to generate the masks of regions
infected by COVID-19. The masks of these two parts of images then were
converted to corresponding volumes to calculate the physical proportion of
infected region of lung. A total of 129 CT image set were herein collected and
studied. The intrinsic Hounsfiled value of CT images was firstly utilized to
generate the initial dirty version of labeled masks both for intact lung and
infected regions. Then, the samples were carefully adjusted and improved by two
professional radiologists to generate the final training set and test
benchmark. Two deep learning models were evaluated: UNet and 2.5D UNet. For the
segment of infected regions, a deep learning based classifier was followed to
remove unrelated blur-edged regions that were wrongly segmented out such as air
tube and blood vessel tissue etc. For the segmented masks of intact lung and
infected regions, the best method could achieve 0.972 and 0.757 measure in mean
Dice similarity coefficient on our test benchmark. As the overall proportion of
infected region of lung, the final result showed 0.961 (Pearson's correlation
coefficient) and 11.7% (mean absolute percent error). The instant proportion of
infected regions of lung could be used as a visual evidence to assist clinical
physician to determine the severity of the case. Furthermore, a quantified
report of infected regions can help predict the prognosis for COVID-19 cases
which were scanned periodically within the treatment cycle.

uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in
the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemics leading or not
to a second wave of infections. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of
COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of order of ten millions units in both
countries.

the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of
infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that
those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most

  from a natural experiment in Sweden","The Bacille Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity
benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized
that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found
that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\'erin (BCG) childhood
vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,
this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took
place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led
to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us
to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with
cross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were
recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change,
representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used
regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19
related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high
precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled
trial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations
were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]),
respectively. We can thus reject with 95\% confidence that universal BCG
vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of
hospitalizations by more than 24%. While the effect of a recent vaccination
must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at
birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.

flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United
States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating
countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March
10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major
city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).
Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We
also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of
posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in
the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram
doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among
Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's
social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram
data and primary survey data.

reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if the
number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this
threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until
the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the
worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of
newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict
containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains
close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can
only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article,
using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment
strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of
susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that
minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The
existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is
fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead
theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an
infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary
measures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze the
minimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, and
show the relationship with the previous problem. Simulations are provided that

more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of

Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those
who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic)
were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who
practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among
Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males,

of the time lag between reported cases and deaths versus time, that yields the
optimal correlation between them is a specific sense. We find that the
resulting corrected CFR (deaths shifted back by this time lag, divided by
cases) is actually constant over many months, for many countries, but also for
the entire world. This optimal time lag and constant CFR for each country can
be found through a simple data driven algorithm. The traditional CFR (ignoring
time lag) is spuriously time-dependent and its evolution is hard to quantify.
Our corrected CFR is constant over time, therefore an important index of the
pandemic in each country, and can be inferred from data earlier on,
facilitating improved early estimates of COVID-19 mortality.

spread. It considers: both detected and undetected infected populations,
medical quarantine and social sequestration, release from sequestration, plus
possible reinfection. The coefficients in the model are evaluated by fitting to
empirical data for eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois,
Louisiana, New Jersey, New York State, and Texas. Together these states make up
43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their
initial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The
evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact
and recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are
larger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate
from sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may have been well
underway in several states before first detected and that California might have
seen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on the current
situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than
two years. Should states fully relax stay-at-home orders, most states may
experience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the
number of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most
states that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact
rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown
compliance (from the current $\sim$ 15% to $\sim$ 30%) will eradicate
infections in the state of Texas within a year. Extending our fits for all of
the US states, we predict about 11 million total infections (including
undetected), 8 million cumulative confirmed cases, and 630,000 cumulative
deaths by November 1, 2020.

The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in
a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not
infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of
dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level.
The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include
testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide
lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the
context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration
or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the
metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on
this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with
COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states,
prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters
are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while
training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the
present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of
testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be
contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by
certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also
necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid
of the second wave of pandemic.

  glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 by biomolecular modeling","SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the disease known as Covid-19, has so far
reported around 3,435,000 cases of human infections, including more than
239,000 deaths in 187 countries, with no effective treatment currently
available. For this reason, it is necessary to explore new approaches for the
development of a drug capable of inhibiting the entry of the virus into the
host cell. Therefore, this work includes the exploration of potential
inhibitory compounds for the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VSB), which
were obtained from The Patogen Box. Later, they were filtered through virtual
screening and molecular docking techniques, thus obtaining a top of 1000
compounds, which were used against a binding site located in the Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD) and a cryptic site located in the N-Terminal Domain (NTD),
resulting in good pharmaceutical targets for the blocking the infection. From
the top 1000, the best compound (TCMDC-124223) was selected for the binding
site. It interacts with specific residues that intervene in the recognition and
subsequent entry into the host cell, resulting in a more favorable binding free
energy in comparison to the control compounds (Hesperidine and Emodine). In the
same way, the compound TCMDC-133766 was selected for the cryptic site. These
identified compounds are potential inhibitors that can be used for the
development of new drugs that allow effective treatment for the disease.

suspension of on-campus education. The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students
conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers,
required students to follow the entire arc of an empirical research cycle
twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was
based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of
experimental research and methods of scientific research. The flipped classroom
approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the
students' actual experiments were carried out independently at home or
elsewhere without the in-person supervision of an instructor. Despite the
COVID-19 measures, all students were able to produce interesting and successful
research projects. While there were of course difficulties encountered due to
the abrupt transition to online teaching, we found several counterbalancing
advantages that bear consideration for inclusion even when all teaching
activities can return to campus. We believe that three components in the design
of the course were vital to the resilience of the course: the choice for fully
open-inquiry projects, the decision to use Arduinos as measurement tools, and
the flipped aspect of the instruction methods. We also include considerations
for adapting these pandemic-resilient methods in other courses and programs.

modelling. Models of contact networks are increasingly used for these purposes,
and are often appropriate for infections that spread from person to person.
Real-world human contact networks are rich in structural features that
influence infection transmission, such as tightly-knit local communities that
are weakly connected to one another. In this paper, we propose a new flow-based
edge-betweenness centrality method for detecting bottleneck edges that connect
communities in contact networks. In particular, we utilize convex optimization
formulations based on the idea of diffusion with $p$-norm network flow. Using
mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission through real network data at both
individual and county levels, we demonstrate that targeting bottleneck edges
identified by the proposed method reduces the number of infected cases by up to
$10\%$ more than state-of-the-art edge-betweenness methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrate empirically that the proposed method is orders of magnitude faster
than existing methods.

almost all governments worldwide to take drastic measures to respond to the
tragedy. Chief among those measures is the massive lockdown of entire countries
and cities, which beyond its global economic impact has created some deep
social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted
mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful,
policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the
mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to
recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit
strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health
interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key
parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb.In this paper, we
propose to augment epidemiological forecasting with actual data-driven models
that will learn to fine-tune predictions for different contexts (e.g., per
country). We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit
that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of
the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm
component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and
objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various
countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with
much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and
achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen
countries. When used for forecasting, this approach provides actionable
insights into the impact of individual measures and strategies.

engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour)

difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to

  nonpharmaceutical interventions in Germany","Aims: Nonpharmaceutical interventions against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in
Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of
schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown""
(from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these
interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time.
Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by
incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay.
Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were
estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series.
Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as
reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and
March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are
found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at
April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From
March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below
one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be
attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes.
Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly.
Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus,
the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover,
assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates
and the influence of test volume.

  during the COVID-19 lockdown: implications for haze mitigation","The COVID-19 outbreak greatly limited human activities and reduced primary
emissions particularly from urban on-road vehicles, but coincided with Beijing
experiencing pandemic haze, raising the public concerns of the validity and
effectiveness of the imposed traffic policies to improve the air pollution.
Here, we explored the relationship between local vehicle emissions and the
winter haze in Beijing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown period based on
an integrated analysis framework, which combines a real-time on-road emission
inventory, in-situ air quality observations and a localized chemical transport
modeling system. We found that traffic emissions decreased substantially
affected by the pandemic, with a higher reduction for NOx (75.9%, 125.3 Mg/day)
compared to VOCs (53.1%, 52.9 Mg/day). Unexpectedly, our results show that the
imbalanced emission abatement of NOx and VOCs from vehicles led to a
significant rise of the atmospheric oxidizing capacity in urban areas, but only
resulting in modest increases in secondary aerosols due to the inadequate
precursors. However, the enhanced oxidizing capacity in the surrounding regions
greatly increased the secondary particles with relatively abundant precursors,
which is mainly responsible for Beijing haze during the lockdown period. Our
results indicate that the winter haze in Beijing was insensitive to the local
vehicular emissions reduction due to the complicated nonlinear response of the
fine particle and air pollutant emissions. We suggest mitigation policies
should focus on accelerating VOC and NH3 emissions reduction and synchronously
controlling regional sources to release the benefits on local traffic emission
control.

any setting, where intervention measures include suspect testing and contact
tracing, this assumption is incorrect and the process is discontinuous. This
discontinuity is linked to a super-exponential growth phase and it considerably
raises the stakes in epidemic control: The decisiveness of mitigation measures

(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson's recovery, with
rising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential

of the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million
replies, or 9% of the number of mentions of ""stay home save lives"" and

epidemics to facilitate cross-epidemic pattern recognition and trend analysis
tasks. During our other efforts on COVID-19 related work, we discover very
little disease related corpora in the literature that are sizable and rich
enough to support such cross-epidemic analysis tasks. In this paper, we present
EPIC30M, a large-scale epidemic corpus that contains 30 millions micro-blog
posts, i.e., tweets crawled from Twitter, from year 2006 to 2020. EPIC30M
contains a subset of 26.2 millions tweets related to three general diseases,

respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection i.e., COVID-19 pandemic, required
sensitive sensors with short sample-to-result durations for performing
diagnostics. In this direction, one of appropriate alternative approach to
detect SARS-CoV-2 at low level (fmol) is exploring plasmonic metasensor
technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in
advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic
merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze
electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However,
the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a
typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed
using toroidal metasurface technology. This research reports fabrication of a
miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept
that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes
in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our
quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on
functionalized gold nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal
antibody of SARS-CoV-2 onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse
concentrations of the spike protein is monitored. Possessing molecular weight
around ~76 kDa allowed us to detect the presence of spike protein with
significantly low LoD ~4.2 fmol.

  For Proximity Detection in a Commuter Bus","We report on the results of a measurement study carried out on a commuter bus
in Dublin, Ireland using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) API.
This API is likely to be widely used by Covid-19 contact tracing apps.
Measurements were collected between 60 pairs of handset locations and are
publicly available. We find that the attenuation level reported by the GAEN API
need not increase with distance between handsets, consistent with there being a
complex radio environment inside a bus caused by the metal-rich environment.
Changing the people holding a pair of handsets, with the location of the
handsets otherwise remaining unchanged, can cause variations of +/-10dB in the
attenuation level reported by the GAEN API. Applying the rule used by the Swiss
Covid-19 contact tracing app to trigger an exposure notification to our bus
measurements we find that no exposure notifications would have been triggered
despite the fact that all pairs of handsets were within 2m of one another for
at least 15 mins. Applying an alternative threshold-based exposure notification
rule can somewhat improve performance to a detection rate of 5% when an
exposure duration threshold of 15 minutes is used, increasing to 8% when the
exposure duration threshold is reduced to 10 mins. Stratifying the data by
distance between pairs of handsets indicates that there is only a weak
dependence of detection rate on distance.

effective alternative to traditional labor intensive contact tracing methods.
However, there are serious privacy and security concerns that may impede
wide-spread adoption in many societies. Furthermore, these methods rely solely
on proximity to patients, based on Bluetooth or GPS signal for example,
ignoring lingering effects of virus, including COVID-19, present in the
environment. This results in inaccurate risk assessment and incomplete contact
tracing. A new system concept, called PrivyTRAC, preserves user privacy,
increases security and improves accuracy of smartphone contact tracing.
PrivyTRAC enhances users' and patients' privacy by letting users conduct
self-evaluation based on the risk maps download to their smartphones. No user
information is transmitted to external locations or devices, and no personally
identifiable patient information is embedded in the risk maps as they are
processed anonymized and aggregated locations of confirmed patients. The risk
maps consider both spatial proximity and temporal effects to improve the
accuracy of the infection risk estimation. Experiments conducted in the paper
illustrate improvement of PrivyTRAC over proximity based methods in terms of
true and false positives. An approach to further improve infection risk
estimation by incorporating both positive and negative local test results from
contacts of confirmed cases is also described.

similarities, SARS-CoV-2 has two main features over the other coronaviruses.
The first is the high contagious rate and the second is the immune response

  a safe distance)","A key safety measure encouraged by health authorities to avoid the SARS-CoV-2
spreading is the distance of one to two meters between people. This recommended
two-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected
drops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit
another person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets
that remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored.
However, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent
experiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate
that, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the
coronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have
confirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the
air but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore,
significant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great
difference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak.
While the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the
southern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high
temperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic
differences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of
the forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the
external environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical
observations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to
use, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in
the same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our
calculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase
contagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the
pandemic.

  Pandemic","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges
for the utilities and grid operators around the world. In this work, we focus
on the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions,
power consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and
daily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in
short-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing
information and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot
capture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic.
In this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to
complement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data
acts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the
implementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major
challenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are
associated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we
design a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between
several different geographical regions. This architecture leverages the
diversity across these regions and the resulting aggregated model can boost the
algorithm performance in each region's day-ahead forecast. Through simulations
for regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform
conventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds. In addition, we
demonstrate how the proposed model can be used to project how electricity
consumption would recover based on different mobility scenarios.

  neural networks","On 19th March, the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Through
this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed
cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures.
However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this
exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt
to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to
quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a
neural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative
infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government
restriction time series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions.
Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model
government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social
distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government
actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter
entry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less
confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but
milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting
Taiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely
data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical
epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that
the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.

  distancing","The first mitigation response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to limit
person-to-person interaction as much as possible. This was implemented by the
temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social
distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and
the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model
of human-human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread. The
nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote
family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential
needs, and social interactions. Each individual can be in one of four states:
susceptible, infected, immune, and dead. The network and the disease parameters
are informed by the existing literature on Covid-19. Using this model, we
simulate the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of various
mitigation scenarios. For example, lockdown is implemented by deleting edges
that denote non-essential interactions. We validate the simulation results with
the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during
different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the
slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are
slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We
make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection
in each of these scenarios.

a network or a graph. In digital advertising, internet device graphs are graph
data sets that organize identifiers produced by mobile phones, PCs, TVs, and

they have become ubiquitous as they enable targeted advertising, content
customization and tracking. This paper posits that internet device graphs, in
particular those based on IP colocation, can provide significant utility in
predicting and modeling the spread of infectious disease. Starting the week of
March 16th, 2020, in the United States, many individuals began to
`shelter-in-place' as schools and workplaces across the nation closed because
of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper quantifies the effect of the
shelter-in-place orders on a large scale internet device graph with more than a
billion nodes by studying the graph before and after orders went into effect.
The effects are clearly visible. The structure of the graph suggests behavior
least conducive to transmission of infection occurred in the US between April
12th and 19th, 2020. This paper also discusses the utility of device graphs for
i) contact tracing, ii) prediction of `hot spots', iii) simulation of

societal question. We collect data from the largest open-access preprint
repository for social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines
produced by 76,832 authors across 25 countries over a span of two years. We use
a difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock.
Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United
States, although the total research productivity increased by 35%, female
academics' productivity dropped by 13.9% relative to that of male academics. We
also show that several disciplines drive such gender inequality. Finally, we
find that this intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for academics in
top-ranked universities, and the effect exists in six other countries. Our work
points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding
that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It
also helps organizations realize the potential unintended consequences that can

human society, it is a big challenge to estimate the potential risks of getting
exposed to a widely spreading virus. To allow the public to be aware of the
exposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based
probability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for
estimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The
exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in
public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops,
office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active
patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the
room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by
doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a
different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds.
The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate
exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved
preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic. We use spatial analysis
tools and drew the county-level exposure risks of the United States from April
1 to May 15. The experiment shows that the estimation model is very promising
to assist people to be more specifically precise about their safety control in

the public health and economy worldwide. To overcome this problem, countries
have adopted different policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions for
controlling the spread of the virus. This paper proposes the COVID-ABS, a new
SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) agent-based model that aims to
simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people,
business and government. Seven different scenarios of social distancing
interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects:
(1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation,
(5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks
together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of
implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths
and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks
and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of
social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming
language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended
to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the
creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to
assist politicians and health authorities to plan their actions against the

  treatments","Introduction: Endpoint choice for randomized controlled trials of treatments
for COVID-19 is complex. A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials
must start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that
improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in
death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence
about clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating
mortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in
between ""cure"" and ""death"" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity
scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary
measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in
relating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes
measured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An
endpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem.
However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the
ordinal scale to a binary state of ""recovered"" vs ""not recovered.""
  Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for
COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent
COVID-19 treatment trials.
  Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time
selected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not
specify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical
power, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal
time.
  Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19
setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in
advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may
increase power for interim analyses.

  COVID-19 pandemic: a pedestrian dynamics-based microscopic simulation
  approach","Mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading has been widely adopted to
estimate the threats of epidemic diseases (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) as well
as to evaluate epidemic control interventions. The indoor place is considered
to be a significant epidemic spreading risk origin, but existing widely-used
epidemic spreading models are usually limited for indoor places since the
dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored, and the empirical
features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In
this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is
capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people's
social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from
the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, it's found that
people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies
are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could
balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people's demand. Based
on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined
non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are
evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on people's travel
frequency and open-hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in
reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry
limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker
needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue
length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel
needs.

  vulnerability and welfare response","We study the effect of social distancing, food vulnerability, welfare and
labour COVID-19 policy responses on riots, violence against civilians and
food-related conflicts. Our analysis uses georeferenced data for 24 African
countries with monthly local prices and real-time conflict data reported in the
Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) from January 2015 until
early May 2020. Lockdowns and recent welfare policies have been implemented in
light of COVID-19, but in some contexts also likely in response to ongoing
conflicts. To mitigate the potential risk of endogeneity, we use instrumental
variables. We exploit the exogeneity of global commodity prices, and three
variables that increase the risk of COVID-19 and efficiency in response such as
countries colonial heritage, male mortality rate attributed to air pollution
and prevalence of diabetes in adults. We find that the probability of
experiencing riots, violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food
looting has increased since lockdowns. Food vulnerability has been a
contributing factor. A 10% increase in the local price index is associated with
an increase of 0.7 percentage points in violence against civilians.
Nonetheless, for every additional anti-poverty measure implemented in response
to COVID-19 the probability of experiencing violence against civilians, riots
and food-related conflicts declines by approximately 0.2 percentage points.
These anti-poverty measures also reduce the number of fatalities associated
with these conflicts. Overall, our findings reveal that food vulnerability has
increased conflict risks, but also offer an optimistic view of the importance
of the state in providing an extensive welfare safety net.

  through combinations of model predictions","A common statistical problem is prediction, or forecasting, in the presence
of an ensemble of multiple candidate models. For example, multiple candidate
models may be available to predict case numbers in a disease epidemic,
resulting from different modelling approaches (e.g. mechanistic or empirical)
or differing assumptions about spatial or age mixing. Alternative models
capture genuine uncertainty in scientific understanding of disease dynamics,
and/or different simplifying assumptions underpinning each model derivation.
While the analysis of multi-model ensembles can be computationally challenging,
accounting for this 'structural uncertainty' can improve forecast accuracy and
reduce the risk of over-estimated confidence. In this paper we look at
combining epidemiological forecasts for COVID-19 daily deaths, hospital
admissions, and hospital and ICU occupancy, in order to improve the predictive
accuracy of the short term forecasts. We combining models via combinations of
individual predictive densities with weights chosen via application of
predictive scoring, as commonly applied in meteorological and economic

  austere COVID-19 pandemic population lockdown","A computational methodology is introduced to minimize infection opportunities
for people suffering some degree of lockdown in response to a pandemic, as is
the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Persons use their mobile phone or computational
device to request trips to places of their need or interest indicating a rough
time of day: `morning', `afternoon', `night' or `any time' when they would like
to undertake these outings as well as the desired place to visit. An artificial
intelligence methodology which is a variant of Genetic Programming studies all
requests and responds with specific time allocations for such visits that
minimize the overall risks of infection, hospitalization and death of people. A
number of alternatives for this computation are presented and results of
numerical experiments involving over 230 people of various ages and background
health levels in over 1700 visits that take place over three consecutive days.
A novel partial infection model is introduced to discuss these proof of concept
solutions which are compared to round robin uninformed time scheduling for
visits to places. The computations indicate vast improvements with far fewer
dead and hospitalized. These auger well for a more realistic study using
accurate infection models with the view to test deployment in the real world.
The input that drives the infection model is the degree of infection by
taxonomic class, such as the information that may arise from population testing
for COVID-19 or, alternatively, any contamination model. The taxonomy class
assumed in the computations is the likely level of infection by age group.

Artificial Intelligence (AI), as an approach to effectively manage pandemics.
IoT provides pervasive connectivity among various devices and can be used for
collecting information such as location and symptoms of potentially infected
individuals. MECs provide cloud services on the edge, integrating IoT
infrastructure and execution of sophisticated AI algorithms in the Cloud. In
this paper, we develop a prototype to demonstrate the convergence of pervasive
technologies to support research in managing pandemics. Low-cost Single Board
Computers (SBC) based clusters are integrated within MEC to support remote
medical teams in the field. The prototype implements a lightweight Docker
container orchestrated by Kubernetes eco-system which is deployed on the
clusters. The prototype successfully demonstrates that mobile medical
facilities can utilize the proposed solution to collect information and execute
AI algorithms while on the go. Finally, we present a discussion on the role of
converging pervasive technologies on managing pandemics.

2020), COVID-19 has been spreading out to over 180 countries and territories.
As of June 18, 2020, in total, there are now over 8,400,000 cases and over
450,000 related deaths. This causes massive losses in the economy and jobs
globally and confining about 58% of the global population. In this paper, we
introduce SenWave, a novel sentimental analysis work using 105+ million
collected tweets and Weibo messages to evaluate the global rise and falls of
sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make a fine-grained analysis on the
feeling when we face this global health crisis, we annotate 10K tweets in
English and 10K tweets in Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic,
thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official
report, and joking. We then utilize an integrated transformer framework, called
simpletransformer, to conduct multi-label sentimental classification by
fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on the labeled data. Meanwhile, in
order for a more complete analysis, we also translate the annotated English
tweets into different languages (Spanish, Italian, and French) to generated
training data for building sentiment analysis models for these languages.
SenWave thus reveals the sentiment of global conversation in six different
languages on COVID-19 (covering English, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and
Chinese), followed the spread of the epidemic. The conversation showed a
remarkably similar pattern of rapid rise and slow decline over time across all
nations, as well as on special topics like the herd immunity strategies, to
which the global conversation reacts strongly negatively. Overall, SenWave
shows that optimistic and positive sentiments increased over time, foretelling
a desire to seek, together, a reset for an improved COVID-19 world.

and rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19 has made it difficult to access
accurate, on-demand information regarding the disease. Online communities,
forums, and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant
questions and answers, or post questions and seek answers from other members.
However, due to the nature of such sites, there are always a limited number of
relevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are
rarely answered immediately. With the advancements in the field of natural
language processing, particularly in the domain of language models, it has
become possible to design chatbots that can automatically answer consumer
questions. However, such models are rarely applied and evaluated in the
healthcare domain, to meet the information needs with accurate and up-to-date
healthcare data. In this paper, we propose to apply a language model for
automatically answering questions related to COVID-19 and qualitatively
evaluate the generated responses. We utilized the GPT-2 language model and
applied transfer learning to retrain it on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset
(CORD-19) corpus. In order to improve the quality of the generated responses,
we applied 4 different approaches, namely tf-idf, BERT, BioBERT, and USE to
filter and retain relevant sentences in the responses. In the performance
evaluation step, we asked two medical experts to rate the responses. We found
that BERT and BioBERT, on average, outperform both tf-idf and USE in

management of their own safety during an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19
by enabling them to view, in advance, the risks they would take if they visit
some given venue (a cafe, the gym, the workplace, the park,...) and,
furthermore, track the accumulation of such risks during the course of any
given day or week. This idea can be presented to users of the app as counting
points. One point represents some constant probability, $p_\text{point}$, of
infection. Then the app would work in a similar way to a calorie counting app
(instead of counting calories we count probability increments of being
infected). Government could set a maximum recommended number of daily (or
weekly) points available to each user in accord with its objectives (bringing
the disease under control, allowing essential workers to work, protecting
vulnerable individuals, ...). It is posited that this, along with other
proposed ""levers"" would allow government to manage a gradual transition to
normalcy. I discuss a circuit framework with wires running between boxes. In
this framework the wires represent possible sources of infection, namely
individuals and the venues themselves (through deposits of pathogens left at
the venue). The boxes represent interactions of these sources (when individuals
visit a venue). This circuit framework allows (i) calculation of points cost
for visiting venues and (ii) probabilistic contact tracing. The points systems
proposed here could complement existing contact tracing apps by adding
functionality to permit users to participate in decision making up front.

use of contact tracing to identify people who are at-risk of developing the
disease through exposure to an infected person. Historically, contact tracing
has been primarily manual but given the exponential spread of the virus that
causes COVID-19, there has been significant interest in the development and use
of digital contact tracing solutions to supplement the work of human contact
tracers. The collection and use of sensitive personal details by these
applications has led to a number of concerns by the stakeholder groups with a
vested interest in these solutions. We explore digital contact tracing
solutions in detail and propose the use of a transparent reporting mechanism,
FactSheets, to provide transparency of and support trust in these applications.

spread of the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Because of
its mutational rate, wide geographical distribution, and host response variance
this coronavirus is currently evolving into an array of strains with increasing
genetic diversity. Most variants apparently have neutral effects for disease
spread and symptoms severity. However, in the viral Spike protein, which is
responsible for host cell attachment and invasion, an emergent variant,
containing the amino acid substitution D to G in position 614 (D614G), was
suggested to increase viral infection capability. To test whether this variant
has epidemiological impact, the temporal distributions of the SARS-CoV-2
samples bearing D or G at position 614 were compared in the USA, Asia and
Europe. The epidemiological curves were compared at early and late epidemic
stages. At early stages, where containment measures were still not fully
implemented, the viral variants are supposed to be unconstrained and its growth
curves might approximate the free viral dynamics. Our analysis shows that the
D614G prevalence and the growth rates of COVID-19 epidemic curves are
correlated in the USA, Asia and Europe. Our results suggest a selective sweep
that can be explained, at least in part, by a propagation advantage of this
variant, in other words, that the molecular level effects of D614G have
sufficient impact on population transmission dynamics as to be detected by
differences in rate coefficients of epidemic growth curves.

and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza
pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as
well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in
a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local
governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate
suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between
economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public
interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major
problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts
certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such
economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,
there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,
which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul
Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or
otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future

We observe that GNNs can identify P0 close to the theoretical bound on
accuracy, without explicit input of dynamics or its parameters. In addition,
GNN is over 100 times faster than classic methods for inference on arbitrary
graph topologies. Our theoretical bound also shows that the epidemic is like a
ticking clock, emphasizing the importance of early contact-tracing. We find a
maximum time after which accurate recovery of the source becomes impossible,

exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian
method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on
the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this
approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The
period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a $45\%$ reduction in the
rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate
reduced from $393\%$ during the pre-lockdown to $33\%$ after lockdown 3,

exponent of around 2.2. The power-law behavior was attributed to a combination
of effective containment and mitigation measures employed as well as behavioral
changes by the population. In this work, we report a random walk Monte Carlo
simulation study of proximity-based infection spread. Social distancing is
incorporated in the simulations through a single parameter, the size of each
step in the random walk process. The step size $l$ is taken to be a multiple of
$\langle r \rangle$, which is the average separation between individuals. Three
temporal growth regimes (quadratic, intermediate power-law and exponential) are
shown to emerge naturally from our simulations. For $l = \langle r \rangle$, we
get intermediate power-law growth exponents that are in general agreement with
available data from China. On the other hand, we obtain a quadratic growth for
smaller step sizes $l \lesssim \langle r \rangle/2 $, while for large $l$ the
growth is found to be exponential. Together with available data, these results
suggest that the early containment of the disease within China was close to
optimal. We further performed a comparative case study of data from three other

diagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection
measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on
radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data
systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we
explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a
single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological
images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called
CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given
condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our
CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of
COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution
radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep
classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from
CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results
are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely
small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data
augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset
(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the
performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on
large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19
diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

accounts for endogeneity in the choice of policy intervention. Our results

large the predictions are independent of $N$. We apply these methodologies to
study the spread of the pandemic in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and

these cases we provide estimates for the reproduction and recovery rates. The
scenario for a time varying contagion rate is optimistic, considering that
reasonable measures are taken such that the reproduction factor $R_0$ decreases

finding a universality of this parameter over various countries. We discuss the

proposed in Wang et a. [l2020] to national and county level COVID-19 data. We
show that this model poorly forecasts the current pandemic. We analyze the two
week ahead forecasting capabilities of the TDEFSI-LONLY model with combinations
of regularization techniques. Effective training of the TDEFSI-LONLY model
requires data augmentation, to overcome this challenge we utilize an SEIR model
and present an inter-county mixing extension to this model to simulate
sufficient training data. Further, we propose an alternate forecast model, {\it
County Level Epidemiological Inference Recurrent Network} (\alg{}) that trains
an LSTM backbone on national confirmed cases to learn a low dimensional time
pattern and utilizes a time distributed dense layer to learn individual county
confirmed case changes each day for a two weeks forecast. We show that the
best, worst, and median state forecasts made using CLEIR-Net model are
respectively New York, South Carolina, and Montana.

Within the framework of the models used, the population is divided into seven

transition probabilities between groups depending on a specific region.
Identifiability analysis of the SEIR-HCD mathematical model was carried out,
which revealed the least sensitive unknown parameters to additional
measurements. The tasks of refining the parameters are reduced to minimizing
the corresponding target functionals, which were solved using stochastic
methods (simulating annealing, differential evolution, genetic algorithm,

development of the disease in the city of Moscow and the Novosibirsk region was
developed, the peak is predicted the development of the epidemic in Moscow with
an error of 2 days and 174 detected cases, and an analysis of the applicability

pandemic is mandatory to be able to design the best social and medical
policies, foresee their outcomes and deal with all the subsequent
socio-economic effects. We address this important problem from a computational
and machine learning perspective. More specifically, we want to statistically
estimate all the relevant parameters for the new coronavirus COVID-19, such as
the reproduction number, fatality rate or length of infectiousness period,
based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This
endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across
the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical,
age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR,
which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to
infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the
pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the
number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to
predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and
infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train
a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model
parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the
solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep
learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show
great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find
an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around
0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the

role both at the beginning and in the most critical weeks of the outbreak, when
local authorities in Italy had to decide whether to impose a lockdown and at
which level. Public opinion was focused on this information as well, to
understand how quickly the epidemic was spreading. When an increase/decrease
was communicated, especially a large one, it was not easy to understand if it
was due to a change in the epidemic evolution or if it was a fluctuation due to
other reasons, such as an increase in the number of swabs or a delay in the
swab processing. In this work, we propose a nonlinear asymmetric diffusion
model, which includes information on the daily number of swabs, to describe
daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases in addition to the main
trend of the outbreak evolution. The class of diffusion models has been
selected to develop our proposal, as it also allows estimation of the total
number of confirmed cases at the end of the outbreak. The proposed model is
compared to six existing models, among which the logistic and the SIRD models

research papers applying deep learning based image processing to chest
radiographs for detection of the disease. To test the performance of the two
top models for CXR COVID-19 diagnosis on external datasets to assess model
generalizability. Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the
efficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19
diagnosis. We provide results from two popular models - COVID-Net and CoroNet
evaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional
dataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing
patients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large
false positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR
(23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54
F1-score and 0.49 precision value. The FPR of the CoroNet model is
significantly lower across all the datasets as compared to COVID-Net -
EMORY(9.1%), ChexPert (1.3%), ChestX-ray14 (0.02%), MIMIC-CXR (0.06%).
Conclusion: The models reported good to excellent performance on their internal
datasets, however we observed from our testing that their performance
dramatically worsened on external data. This is likely from several causes
including overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and
ground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR,
which could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa.
Therefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have
better performance and generalization.

contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature

ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the

forecasts to make informed decisions on passing legislation and allocating
resources. We used US county-level data on daily deaths and population
statistics to forecast future deaths. We extended the SIR epidemiological model
to a novel model we call the PECAIQR model. It adds several new variables and
parameters to the naive SIR model by taking into account the ramifications of
the partial quarantining implemented in the US. We fitted data to the model
parameters with numerical integration. Because of the fit degeneracy in
parameter space and non-constant nature of the parameters, we developed several
methods to optimize our fit, such as training on the data tail and training on
specific policy regimes. We use cross-validation to tune our hyper parameters
at the county level and generate a CDF for future daily deaths. For predictions
made from training data up to May 25th, we consistently obtained an averaged
pinball loss score of 0.096 on a 14 day forecast. We finally present examples
of possible avenues for utility from our model. We generate longer-time horizon

simple models, alongside the majority of pretrained networks in the literature,
focus on irrelevant features for decision-making. In this paper, numerous chest

the well-known CheXNet model is utilized for developing COVID-CXNet. This
powerful model is capable of detecting the novel coronavirus pneumonia based on
relevant and meaningful features with precise localization. COVID-CXNet is a
step towards a fully automated and robust COVID-19 detection system.

become an urgent need in this pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in

30-layered CNN model (named as CovNet30) during the training, and obtained
sub-models are stacked together using logistic regression. The proposed CNN
model combines the discriminating power of the different CNN`s sub-models and
classifies chest X-ray images into COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia classes. In
addition, we generate X-ray images dataset referred to as COVID19CXr, which
includes 2764 chest x-ray images of 1768 patients from the three publicly

series of daily cumulative COVID-19 cases were used for generating 1-day,

k-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and
k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the
performance of the models in forecasting time series values for multiple days.
Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as
0.05%, while those for ARIMA were 0.07% and 0.06% respectively. LSTM models
slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the
forecasts. The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting
COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform
reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a
large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period

  the COVID-19 Pandemic","The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased
the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the
same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted
their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot
be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights
-- as well as the possibility of controlling the system -- may be compromised.
Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many
variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different
models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and
assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem
using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and
observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic,
we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We
analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models,
considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which
leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models
according to their structural identifiability and observability under the
different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also
illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of
observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most
informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge
and measurements.

as a response to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and has resorted to a
process of 'unlocking' the lockdown over the past couple of months. This work
attempts to examine the effect of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and its
resulting disease, the COVID-19, on the foreign exchange rates and stock market
performances of India using secondary data over a span of 112 days spanning
between March 11 and June 30, 2020. The study explores whether the causal
relationships and directions among the growth rate of confirmed cases
(GROWTHC), exchange rate (GEX) and SENSEX value (GSENSEX) are remaining the
same across different pre and post-lockdown phases, attempting to capture any
potential changes over time via the vector autoregressive (VAR) models. A
positive correlation is found between the growth rate of confirmed cases and
the growth rate of exchange rate, and a negative correlation between the growth
rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of SENSEX value. However, on
applying a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, it is observed that an increase
in the confirmed COVID-19 cases causes no significant change in the values of
the exchange rate and SENSEX index. The result varies if the analysis is split
across different time periods - before lockdown, the four phases of lockdown,
and the first phase of unlock. Nuanced and sensible interpretations of the
numeric results indicate significant variability across time in terms of the
relation between the variables of interest. The detailed knowledge about the
varying patterns of dependence could potentially help the policy makers and
investors of India in order to develop their strategies to cope up with the

stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of
infected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remains
higher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable. For the estimated

particular benefits in identifying how therapeutics effective in one context
might have utility in an unknown clinical context or against a novel pathology.
We aim to discover the underlying associations between viral proteins and
antiviral therapeutics that are effective against them by employing neural
network models. Using the National Center for Biotechnology Information virus
protein database and the DrugVirus database, which provides a comprehensive
report of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) and viruses they inhibit, we
trained ANN models with virus protein sequences as inputs and antiviral agents
deemed safe-in-humans as outputs. Model training excluded SARS-CoV-2 proteins
and included only Phases II, III, IV and Approved level drugs. Using sequences
for SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) as inputs to the trained
models produces outputs of tentative safe-in-human antiviral candidates for
treating COVID-19. Our results suggest multiple drug candidates, some of which
complement recent findings from noteworthy clinical studies. Our in-silico
approach to drug repurposing has promise in identifying new drug candidates and
treatments for other viruses.

coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory
illness responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently there is no known
vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 and so, there is an urgent
need for expedite discovery of new therapeutics to combat the disease until a

identifying new uses for approved drugs that has the advantage (over
conventional approaches that attempt to develop a drug from scratch) that time
frame of the overall process can be significantly reduced because of the few
number of clinical trial required. In this work, a virtual screening of
FDA-approved drugs was performed for repositioning as potential inhibitors of
the main protease Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. As a result of this study, 12 drugs are
proposed as candidates for inhibitors of the Mpro enzyme. Some of the selected
compounds are antiviral drugs that are already being tested in COVID-19
clinical trials (i.e. ribavirin) or are used to alleviate symptoms of the
disease (i.e. codeine). Surprisingly, the most promising candidate is the
naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic oxytetracycline. This compound
has largely outperformed the remaining selected candidates along all filtering
steps of our virtual screening protocol. If the activity of any of these drugs
is experimentally corroborated, they could be used directly in clinical trials
without the need for pre-clinical testing or safety evaluation since they are
already used as drugs for other diseases.

  Graphical Models?","We consider the problem of learning a sparse graph under Laplacian
constrained Gaussian graphical models. This problem can be formulated as a
penalized maximum likelihood estimation of the precision matrix under Laplacian
structural constraints. Like in the classical graphical lasso problem, recent
works made use of the $\ell_1$-norm regularization with the goal of promoting
sparsity in Laplacian structural precision matrix estimation. However, we find
that the widely used $\ell_1$-norm is not effective in imposing a sparse
solution in this problem. Through empirical evidence, we observe that the
number of nonzero graph weights grows with the increase of the regularization
parameter. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a large regularization
parameter will surprisingly lead to a fully connected graph. To address this
issue, we propose a nonconvex estimation method by solving a sequence of
weighted $\ell_1$-norm penalized sub-problems and prove that the statistical
error of the proposed estimator matches the minimax lower bound. To solve each
sub-problem, we develop a projected gradient descent algorithm that enjoys a
linear convergence rate. Numerical experiments involving synthetic and
real-world data sets from the recent COVID-19 pandemic and financial stock
markets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. An open source

transmission routes in the COVID-19 spread, in this study, we have developed
the first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2

index-cases using government press releases, their official social media
handles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a
spatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges
and follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a
novel stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for
stochastic addition of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A
peculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a
fourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the
average random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF
realizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge betweenness, it is found
that most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of
countries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there are no
spatial constraints on the spread of disease. This work characterizes the

neighborhoods.

immediate need for accurate information. As with any outbreak, the outbreak
follows a clear trajectory, and subsequently, the supporting information for
that outbreak needs to address the needs associated with that stage of the
outbreak. At first, there was a need to inform the public of the information
related to the initial situation related to the ""who"" of the COVID-19 disease.
However, as time continued, the ""where"", ""when"" and ""how to"" related questions
started to emerge in relation to the public healthcare system themselves.
Questions surrounding the health facilities including COVID-19 hospital bed
capacity, locations of designated COVID-19 facilities, and general information
related to these facilities were not easily accessible to the general public.
Furthermore, the available information was found to be outdated, fragmented
across several platforms, and still had gaps in the data related to these
facilities. To rectify this problem, a group of volunteers working on the
covid19za project stepped in to assist. Each member leading a part of the
project chose to focus on one of four problems related to the challenges
associated with the Hospital information including: data quality, data
completeness, data source validation and data visualisation capacity. As the
project developed, so did the sophistication of the data, visualisation and
core function of the project. The future prospects of this project relate to a
Progressive Web Application that will avail this information for the public as
well as healthcare workers through comprehensive mapping and data quality.

variability of air quality changes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
focus on two federally regulated pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine
particulate matter (PM2.5). Observed concentrations at all available ground
monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively) were compared
between April 2020 and April of the prior five years, 2015-2019, as the
baseline. Large statistically significant decreases in NO2 concentrations were
found at more than 65% of the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 ppb
when compared to the mean of the previous five years. The same patterns are
confirmed by satellite-derived NO2 column totals from NASA OMI. PM2.5
concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were more likely to
be higher. The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses
of the two pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward
is that the shelter-in-place measures affected peoples' driving patterns most
dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial
vehicles and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged,
thus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a
correlation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people
were sheltering in place, we use a mobility index, which was produced and made
public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at
the county level to capture changes in human movement over time. We found a
strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO2 concentrations and
decreases in human mobility. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected
between mobility and PM2.5 concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in
personal-vehicle traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM2.5
pollution.

crucial, especially in cases such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic. One of the
factors that contributed to the spread of the pandemic, was the late diagnosis

infected by one infectious person during an epidemic outbreak, known as the

responses. There are generally two types of such a number, i.e., basic and

expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where
all individuals are susceptible, effective reproduction number is the number of
cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper, we exploit
the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them
through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the
pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease

Social distancing measures made fewer people available to work. In such
situations, robots were pointed at to support humans to address a shortage in
supply. An important activity where humans are needed in a manufacturing value
chain is assembly. HRC assembly systems are supposed to safeguard coexisting
humans, perform a range of actions, and often need to be reconfigured to handle
product variety. This requires them to be resilient and adaptable to various
configurations during their operational life. Besides the potential advantages
of using robots the challenges of using them in an industrial assembly are
enormous. Methods: This mini-review summarizes the challenges of industrial
deployment of collaborative robots for assembly applications. Applications: The
documented challenges highlight the future research directions in human-robot

  COVID-19","The spreading of virus infection is here simulated over artificial human
networks. The real-space urban life of people is modeled as a modified
scale-free network with constraints. A scale-free network has been adopted in
several studies for modeling on-line communities so far but is modified here
for the aim to represent peoples' social behaviors where the generated
communities are restricted reflecting the spatiotemporal constraints in the
real life. Furthermore, the networks have been extended by introducing multiple
cliques in the initial step of network construction and enabling people to
zero-degree people as well as popular (large degree) people. As a result, four
findings and a policy proposal have been obtained. First, the ""second waves""
occur without external influence or constraints on contacts or the releasing of
the constraints. These second waves, mostly lower than the first wave, implies
the bridges between infected and fresh clusters may trigger new expansions of
spreading. Second, if the network changes the structure on the way of infection
spreading or after its suppression, the peak of the second wave can be larger
than the first. Third, the peak height in the time series depends on the
difference between the upper bound of the number of people each member accepts
to meet and the number of people one chooses to meet. This tendency is observed
for two kinds of artificial networks and implies the impact of the bridges
between communities on the virus spreading. Fourth, the release of once given
constraint may trigger a second wave higher than the peak of the time series
without introducing any constraint from the beginning, if the release is
introduced at a time close to the peak. Thus, both governments and individuals
should be careful in returning to human society with inter-community contacts.

with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch

false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a
Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that
our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate

  Epidemic by Vehicle Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery","Wuhan, the biggest city in China's central region with a population of more
than 11 million, was shut down to control the COVID-19 epidemic on 23 January,
2020. Even though many researches have studied the travel restriction between
cities and provinces, few studies focus on the transportation control inside
the city, which may be due to the lack of the measurement of the transportation
ban. Therefore, we evaluate the implementation of transportation ban policy
inside the city by extracting motor vehicles on the road from two
high-resolution remote sensing image sets before and after Wuhan lockdown. In
order to detect vehicles from the remote sensing image datasets with the
resolution of 0.8m accurately, we proposed a novel method combining anomaly
detection, region grow and deep learning. The vehicle numbers in Wuhan dropped
with a percentage of at least 63.31% caused by COVID-19. Considering fewer
interferences, the dropping percentages of ring road and high-level road should
be more representative with the value of 84.81% and 80.22%. The districts
located in city center were more intensively affected by the transportation
ban. Since the public transportations have been shut down, the significant
reduction of motor vehicles indicates that the lockdown policy in Wuhan show
effectiveness in controlling human transmission inside the city.

how inference on the renewal equation is easy to accomplish within a Bayesian

on possible changes in electricity consumption trends. The overall theme of
these reports was that ``electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but
the power grid is still reliable''---mostly due to reduced economic activity.
In this paper we analyze electricity data upto end of May 2020, examining both
electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid,
such as peak demand and demand ramp-rate. We limit this study to three states
in the USA: New York, California, and Florida. The results indicate that the
effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction from
comparable time frames, and there are noticeable differences among regions. The
variables that can indicate stress on the grid also conveyed mixed messages:
some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not
indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes
that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to
revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to
the pandemic is correcting for weather. We provide a weather-correction method,
apply it to a small city-wide area, and discuss the implications of the
estimated changes in demand. The weather correction exercise underscored that
weather-correction is as challenging as it is important.

Specifically, we propose a comprehensive data-driven approach to understand the

evolution, and ultimately alleviate its impact. By leveraging cohort-level
clinical data, patient-level hospital data, and census-level epidemiological
data, we develop an integrated four-step approach, combining descriptive,
predictive and prescriptive analytics. First, we aggregate hundreds of clinical
studies into the most comprehensive database on COVID-19 to paint a new
macroscopic picture of the disease. Second, we build personalized calculators
to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics,
symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel
epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social
distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to re-allocate
ventilators and alleviate shortages. Our results have been used at the clinical
level by several hospitals to triage patients, guide care management, plan ICU
capacity, and re-distribute ventilators. At the policy level, they are
currently supporting safe back-to-work policies at a major institution and
equitable vaccine distribution planning at a major pharmaceutical company, and
have been integrated into the US Center for Disease Control's pandemic

second, ClinicalBERT_Multi, that incorporates rich information available in

  Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users towards an
item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However,
they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such
sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive
and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the
United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into
consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel
pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and
emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people
about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51
states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic
characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of
COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to
perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors
that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from
the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education
levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher
house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast,
households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to
reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments.
The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high
goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers
where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to
improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of
pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.

  density, demographics, climate, depletion of susceptibles, and intervention
  in the first wave of COVID-19 in the United States","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused significant mortality and morbidity
worldwide, sparing almost no community. As the disease will likely remain a
threat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human
demographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate,
susceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics
will be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of
local epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic,
population density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking
social distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the
spread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate
of exponential growth (or decay) in cases/mortality, we find that
population-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of
growth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct
metropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a
nearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions
in mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to
intervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then
develop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and
local climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the
population was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved
via depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., ""herd immunity""), while most
regions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results
will be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can
be facilitated using our online dashboard.

unavailability of any vaccine or drug that can effectively and
deterministically work against it. Naturally, different possibilities
(including herbal medicines having known therapeutic significance) have been
explored by the scientists. The systematic scientific study (beginning with in
silico study) of herbal medicines in particular and any drug in general is now
possible as the structural components (proteins) of COVID-19 are already
characterized. The main protease of COVID-19 virus is $\rm{M^{pro}}$ or
$\rm{3CL^{pro}}$ which is a key CoV enzyme and an attractive drug target as it
plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. In the
present study, $\rm{3CL^{pro}}$ is used to study drug:3CLpro interactions and
thus to investigate whether all or any of the main chemical constituents of
Tinospora cordifolia (e.g., berberine $\rm{(C_{20}H_{18}NO_{4})}$,

$\rm{(C_{28}H_{58}O))}$ can be used as an anti-viral drug against SARS-CoV-2.
The in silico study performed using tools of network pharmacology, molecular
docking including molecular dynamics have revealed that among all considered
phytochemicals in Tinospora cordifolia, berberine can regulate $\rm{3CL^{pro}}$

especially in urban areas. During spring 2020, many countries enacted social
distancing measures in order to slow down the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. A
particularly drastic measure, the ""lockdown"", urged people to stay at home and
thereby prevent new Covid-19 infections. In turn, it also reduced traffic and
industrial activities. But how much did these lockdown measures improve air
quality in large cities, and are there differences in how air quality was
affected? Here, we analyse data from two megacities: London as an example for
Europe and Delhi as an example for Asia. We consider data during and before the
lockdown and compare these to a similar time period from 2019. Overall, we find
a reduction in almost all air pollutants with intriguing differences between
the two cities. In London, despite smaller average concentrations, we still
observe high-pollutant states and an increased tendency towards extreme events
(a higher kurtosis during lockdown). For Delhi, we observe a much stronger
decrease of pollution concentrations, including high pollution states. These
results could help to design rules to improve long-term air quality in
megacities.

colossal chaos, impulse among researchers worldwide to exploit all the
resources and capabilities to understand and analyze characteristics of the
coronavirus in term of the ways it spreads and virus incubation time. For that,
the existing medical features like CT and X-ray images are used. For example,
CT-scan images can be used for the detection of lung infection. But the
challenges of these features such as the quality of the image and infection
characteristics limitate the effectiveness of these features. Using artificial
intelligence (AI) tools and computer vision algorithms, the accuracy of
detection can be more accurate and can help to overcome these issues. This
paper proposes a multi-task deep-learning-based method for lung infection

regions. Also, to perform a multi-class segmentation the proposed model is
trained using the two-stream inputs. The multi-task learning used in this paper
allows us to overcome shortage of labeled data. Also, the multi-input stream
allows the model to do the learning on many features that can improve the

result, connections between personal identity and the ownership of on-chain

the most popular solutions that have emerged is the use of video conferencing

resulted in unprecedented growth in the number of video conferencing users. In
this study, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual

text recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our web
crawling curated dataset of over 15,700 collage images, and over 142,000 face

privacy-concerning, easily accessible approach to monitoring the human mobility
that has been proved to be associated with the viral transmission. In this
study, we analyzed 587 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative
efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated
information at the global, country, and the U.S. state scale. Considering the
multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the
single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness
in certain geographical regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive
index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time
window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data
are amendable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the
proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March
11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less
periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have
obviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons
reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting
mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of
mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation
measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is
distinct. However, the impacts varied substantially among states. The strong

  Transition Matrix Model Approach","Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, numerous
forecasting models have been proposed to project the trajectory of coronavirus
infection cases. We propose a new discrete-time Markov chain transition matrix
model that directly incorporates stochastic behavior and for which parameter
estimation is straightforward from available data. Using such data from China's
Hubei province (for which Wuhan is the provincial capital city), the model is
shown to be flexible, robust, and accurate. As a result, it has been adopted by
the first Shanghai assistance medical team in Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which
was the first designated hospital to take COVID-19 patients in the world. The
forecast has been used for preparing medical staff, intensive care unit (ICU)
beds, ventilators, and other critical care medical resources and for supporting
real-time medical management decisions. Empirical data from China's first two
months (January/February) of fighting COVID-19 was collected and used to
enhance the model by embedding NPI efficiency into the model. We applied the
model to forecast Italy, South Korea, and Iran on March 9. Later we made
forecasts for Spain, Germany, France, US on March 24. Again, the model has
performed very well, proven to be flexible, robust, and accurate for most of
these countries/regions outside China.

quickly enable Vadere users to conduct their own studies without understanding

varying coefficient (VC) model and additive model. We call it Semi-VCAM in
which the response could be a functional/longitudinal variable, and the
explanatory variables could be a mixture of functional/longitudinal and scalar
variables. Notably some of the scalar variables could be categorical variables
as well. The Semi-VCAM simultaneously allows for both substantial flexibility
and the maintaining of one-dimensional rates of convergence. A local linear
smoothing with the aid of an initial B spline series approximation is developed
to estimate the unknown functional effects in the model. To avoid the
subjective choice between the sparse and dense cases of the data, we establish
the asymptotic theories of the resultant Pilot Estimation Based Local Linear
Estimators (PEBLLE) on a unified framework of sparse, dense and ultra-dense
cases of the data. Moreover, we construct unified consistent tests to justify
whether a parsimony submodel is sufficient or not. These test methods also
avoid the subjective choice between the sparse, dense and ultra dense cases of
the data. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies investigating the finite
sample performance of the proposed methodologies confirm our asymptotic
results. We further illustrate our methodologies via analyzing the COVID-19

builds computational models for the same. The aim is to assist clinicians with
a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known
to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right
set of antivirals for the mutated isolate.
  The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly
shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their
corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the
chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with
this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug
re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed
on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The
best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for
COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under
various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in
combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and
Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide,
which is a novel tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety
when compared to the counterpart tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail,
the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish
that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also
demonstrate how the selected drugs change as the SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time,
suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction.

non-violent mortality of Peru, controlling for the effect of quarantine.
Methods: Analysis of longitudinal data from the departments of Peru using
official public information from the National Death Information System and the
Ministry of Health of Peru. The analysis is performed between January 1, 2018
and June 23, 2020 (100 days of quarantine). The daily death rate per million
inhabitants has been used. The days in which the departments were quarantined
with a limit number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 were used to estimate the
quarantine impact. Three limits were established for cases: less than 1, 10 and
100 cases. Result: In Peru, the daily death rate per million inhabitants
decreased by -1.89 (95% CI: -2.70; -1.07) on quarantine days and without
COVID-19 cases. When comparing this result with the total number of non-violent
deaths, the excess deaths during the first 100 days of quarantine is 36,230.
This estimate is 1.12 times the estimate with data from 2019 and 4.2 times the
deaths officers by COVID-19. Conclusion: Quarantine reduced nonviolent deaths;
however, they are overshadowed by the increase as a direct or indirect cause of
the pandemic. Therefore, the difference between the number of current deaths
and that of past years underestimates the real excess of deaths.

  Models with Applications to Forecasting Number of Deaths during the COVID-19
  Pandemic","Motivated by the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is
due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the important problem of forecasting daily
deaths and cumulative deaths, this paper examines the construction of
prediction regions or intervals under the Poisson regression model and for an
over-dispersed Poisson regression model. For the Poisson regression model,
several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared
through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of
forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to
COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened,
daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by
June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data
relative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression
model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival
Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The
Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson
regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion
parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number
of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is
presented. Finally, the paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and
mentions open research problems, as well as the dangers and pitfalls when
forecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic where events, both
foreseen and unforeseen, could have huge impacts on point predictions and

demand decrease of about $64\%$ (IATA, April 2020) which triggered already
several bankruptcies of airline companies all over the world. While the
robustness of the world airline network (WAN) was mostly studied as an
homogeneous network, we introduce a new tool for analyzing the impact of a
company failure: the `airline company network' where two airlines are connected
if they share at least one route segment. Using this tool, we observe that the
failure of companies well connected with others has the largest impact on the
connectivity of the WAN. We then explore how the global demand reduction
affects airlines differently, and provide an analysis of different scenarios if
its stays low and does not come back to its pre-crisis level. Using traffic
data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and simple assumptions about
customer's airline choice strategies, we find that the local effective demand
can be much lower than the average one, especially for companies that are not
monopolistic and share their segments with larger companies. Even if the
average demand comes back to $60\%$ of the total capacity, we find that between
$46\%$ and $59\%$ of the companies could experience a reduction of more than
$50\%$ of their traffic, depending on the type of competitive advantage that
drives customer's airline choice. These results highlight how the complex
competitive structure of the WAN weakens its robustness when facing such a

  Segmentation in CT Images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread aggressively across the world
causing an existential health crisis. Thus, having a system that automatically
detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the
severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires
significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling
challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each
infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label
a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to
10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on
point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels.
However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a
consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to
be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images. The experiments
on 3 open-source COVID-19 datasets show that this loss function yields
significant improvement over conventional point-level loss functions and almost
matches the performance of models trained with full supervision with much less
human effort. Code is available at:

  Social Media","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly
influenced people's daily lives across the globe. Emergent measures and
policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to
combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also
at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring
people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely
necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other
hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and
share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts
(e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for
people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework
to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive
social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to
COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher
ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into
the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been
constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like
``stay safe home"" are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as
``people death"" are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the
proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the
topic-level sentiment dynamics.

utmost accuracy in terms of predicting missing links. We then predict hitherto

conventional group testing schemes where the measurements are Boolean. The
proposed schemes provide higher testing throughput than the popularly used

This study aimed to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to
prospectively predict the expected number of cases without any intervention.
The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was
analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic,
Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The
resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent
data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the
current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions
with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate
model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as
determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately
predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance
respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The
simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future
cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results
demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given
country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated
models of population behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the
efficacy of current prescriptive measures against disease spread.

This is especially crucial at the onset of the pandemic when the data is scarce

including US, Brazil and Russia are still not able to contain the pandemic with
the US having the worst performance. Furthermore, Iran and South Korea are
likely to experience the second wave of the pandemic. A real-time exercise show
that the proposed structure delivers timely and precise information on the
current stance of the pandemic ahead of the competitors that use rolling
window. This, in turn, transforms into accurate short-term predictions of the
active cases. We further modify the model to allow for unreported cases.
Results suggest that the effects of the presence of these cases on the

and economical consequences. As a result, authorities around the globe have
expressed their needs for better tools to monitor the spread of the virus and
to support human labor. Researchers and technology companies such as Google and
Apple have offered to develop such tools in the form of contact tracing
applications. The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's
proximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in
contact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine
and possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these
smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and
privacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing
creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major
risks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies
and/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in
order to force individuals to go into quarantine. In April 2020, the
Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) was announced with
the goal to develop and evaluate secure solutions for European countries.
However, after a while, several team members left this consortium and created

engines$\unicode{x2013}$though rigorously evaluated$\unicode{x2013}$are

commercial search engines deployed for the pandemic will gain much higher
traction than those produced in academic labs, and thus leads to questions
about the empirical performance of these search tools. This paper seeks to
empirically evaluate two such commercial search engines for COVID-19, produced
by Google and Amazon, in comparison to the more academic prototypes evaluated

inter-region connectivity, and temporal edges represent node features through
time. We evaluate this approach on the US county level COVID-19 dataset, and
demonstrate that the rich spatial and temporal information leveraged by the

reduction of RMSLE and an absolute Pearson Correlation improvement from 0.9978

  Restrictions for Epidemic Control","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across more than 180
countries and territories since late January 2020. As a worldwide emergency
response, governments have taken various measures and implemented policies,
such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional
lockdown, to control the rapid spread of this epidemic. The common intention of
these countermeasures is to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a
highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission.
Medical experts and policy makers have expressed the urgency of being able to
effectively evaluate the effects of human restriction policies with the aid of
big data and information technology. Thus, in this study, based on big human
mobility data and city POI data, we designed an interactive visual analytics
system named EpiMob (Epidemic Mobility). The system interactively simulates the
changes in human mobility and the number of infected people in response to the
implementation of a certain restriction policy or combination of policies
(e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently
designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction
policies, and the result reflecting the infection situation under different
policies is dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared. We completed
multiple case studies of the largest metropolitan area in Japan (i.e., Greater
Tokyo Area) and conducted interviews with domain experts to demonstrate that
our system can provide illustrative insight by measuring and comparing the
effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control.

weather events due to climate change or the extreme disruption caused by the
coronavirus pandemic, have triggered massive and precipitous human mobility
changes. The ability to quickly predict traffic patterns in different scenarios
has become more urgent to support short-term operations and long-term
transportation planning, emergency management, and resource allocation. Urban
traffic exhibits a high spatial correlation in which links adjacent to a
congested link are likely to become congested due to spillback effects. The
spillback behavior requires modeling the entire metropolitan area to recognize
all of the upstream and downstream effects from intentional or unintentional
perturbations to the network. However, there is a well-known trade-off between
increasing the level of detail of a model and decreasing computational
performance. This paper addresses these performance shortcomings by introducing
a new platform MANTA for traffic microsimulation at the metropolitan-scale.
MANTA employs a highly parallelized GPU implementation that is fast enough to
run simulations on large-scale demand and networks within a few minutes. We
test our platform to simulate the entire Bay Area metropolitan region over the
course of the morning using half-second time steps. The runtime for the
nine-county Bay Area simulation is just over four minutes, not including
routing and initialization. This computational performance significantly
improves state of the art in large-scale traffic microsimulation and offers new
capacity for analyzing the detailed travel patterns and travel choices of

  with dynamic segregation","Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding
of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from
Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap.
Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost
uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of
education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to
cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people
from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service
jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but
the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this
sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the
extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to
other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census
and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic
segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with
the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The
results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they
live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.

epidemics has been perceived and used as a central element in understanding,
predicting, and governing the pandemic event. However, soon it became clear
that long term predictions were extremely challenging to address. Moreover, it
is still unclear which metric shall be used for a global description of the
evolution of the outbreaks. Yet a robust modeling of pandemic dynamics and a
consistent choice of the transmission metric is crucial for an in-depth
understanding of the macroscopic phenomenology and better-informed mitigation
strategies. In this study, we propose a Markovian stochastic framework designed
to describe the evolution of entropy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the
instantaneous reproductive ratio. We then introduce and use entropy-based
metrics of global transmission to measure the impact and temporal evolution of
a pandemic event. In the formulation of the model, the temporal evolution of
the outbreak is modeled by the master equation of a nonlinear Markov process
for a statistically averaged individual, leading to a clear physical
interpretation. We also provide a full Bayesian inversion scheme for
calibration. The time evolution of the entropy rate, the absolute change in the
system entropy, and the instantaneous reproductive ratio are natural and
transparent outputs of this framework. The framework has the appealing property
of being applicable to any compartmental epidemic model. As an illustration, we
apply the proposed approach to a simple modification of the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model. Applying the model to the
Hubei region, South Korean, Italian, Spanish, German, and French COVID-19
data-sets, we discover a significant difference in the absolute change of
entropy but highly regular trends for both the entropy evolution and the
instantaneous reproductive ratio.

they are now a defacto component of our daily news cycle and because their
results influence governments and business in ways which are not always obvious
to us. However, polling is not always accurate and there have been some really
inaccurate polling results which have had major influences on the world going
back to the 1930s but also as recently as just the last 3 or 4 years. In this
paper we analyse the phenomenon of socially desirable responding (shy voters)
which has emerged as one of the reasons for modern day inaccurate polling. We
describe how it can be exposed through implicit association tests (IATs) and we
demonstrate the shy voter effect in a small survey on opinions in Ireland
towards the United Kingdom. We argue for inclusion of IATs in traditional
polling and point to the fact that these can be conducted accurately online,
which also allows polling to reach a larger and more diverse sample of

imposed and lifted at an early stage of an epidemic. We show that, in these
models, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert
a significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of
a lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the
end of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date
without the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to
explain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental
models. We qualitatively discuss some important effects of a lockdown, which go
beyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease
an epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and
the limitations of currently available data, we conclude that simple
epidemiological models cannot be used to reliably quantify the impact of the
Indian lockdown on fatalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

testing budget is often limited. Here we study how institutions, such as
nursing homes, should utilize a fixed test budget for early detection of an

budget of tests, it is generally better to test smaller subgroups of the
population frequently than to test larger groups but less frequently. The
numerical results are consistent with an analytical expression we derive for
the size of the outbreak at detection in an exponential spread model. Our work
provides a simple guideline for institutions: distribute your total tests over
several batches instead of using them all at once. We expect that in the
appropriate scenarios, this easy-to-implement policy recommendation will lead

infection outbreaks in international populations. One example is mobile phone
applications, which attempt to alert infected individuals and their contacts by
automatically inferring two key components of infection risk: the proximity to
an individual who may be infected, and the duration of proximity. The former
component, proximity, relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal
Strength Indicator(RSSI) as a distance sensor, and this has been shown to be
problematic; not least because of unpredictable variations caused by different
device types, device location on-body, device orientation, the local
environment and the general noise associated with radio frequency propagation.
In this paper, we present an approach that infers posterior probabilities over
distance given sequences of RSSI values. Using a single-dimensional Unscented
Kalman Smoother (UKS) for non-linear state space modelling, we outline several
Gaussian process observation transforms, including: a generative model that
directly captures sources of variation; and a discriminative model that learns
a suitable observation function from training data using both distance and
infection risk as optimisation objective functions. Our results show that good
risk prediction can be achieved in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time on real-world data
sets, with the UKS outperforming more traditional classification methods

This is an enormous opportunity for real-estate operators to innovate and

exposed just how vulnerable they are -- especially those living in close

requiring close physical contact with trained caregivers. Not only are trained
caregivers short in supply, but the pandemic has made it evident that
conventional high-touch approaches to senior care are high-cost and greater

demographic, and even fewer who want to undertake the additional training and
risk of working in a senior facility, especially given the current pandemic. In

droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We
propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is
proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our
puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm

puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold

for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its
coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes
dependent on the ambient air currents and turbulence.

the work, we propose the use of federated learning for COVID-19 data training
and deploy experiments to verify the effectiveness. And we also compare
performances of four popular models (MobileNet, ResNet18, MoblieNet, and
COVID-Net) with the federated learning framework and without the framework.
This work aims to inspire more researches on federated learning about COVID-19.

  SARS-CoV","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic clock is ticking and the survival of many
of mankind's modern institutions and or survival of many individuals is at
stake. There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as
SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified;
those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice.
  Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three
svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment
algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment
scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches as much as the other
mutations. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can
bind to U, hence, our scoring. We also validate this hypothesis using a novel,
independent computational experiment. To validate our results, we confirmed the
discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the tested publicly available
genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2
orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also
report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered
orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore,
antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.

  splittings of type II with application to Covid-19 pandemic model","Monotone matrices play a key role in the convergence theory of regular
splittings and different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity
fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned
classes of matrices. In such a case, $K$-monotonicity is sufficient for the
convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a
proper cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage
iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature.
Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in
standard proper cone setting, i.e., $K=\mathbb{R}^n_+$), is open. To this end,
we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak
regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some
sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a
two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some
comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the
stationary two-stage iterative method in case of a $K$-weak regular splitting
of type II. The most interesting and important part of this work is on
$M$-matrices appearing in the Covid-19 pandemic model. Finally, numerical
computations are performed using the proposed technique to compute the next
generation matrix involved in the pandemic model.

countries, becoming classified as a pandemic. So far, there is no definitive
treatment or vaccine, so the best solution is to prevent transmission between
individuals through social distancing. However, it is difficult to measure the
effectiveness of these distance measures. Therefore, this study uses data from
Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports to try to understand the mobility
patterns of the Portuguese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this
study, the Rt value was modeled for Portugal. Also, the changepoint was
calculated for the population mobility patterns. Thus, the change in the
mobility pattern was used to understand the impact of social distance measures
on the dissemination of COVID-19. As a result, it can be stated that the
initial Rt value in Portugal was very close to 3, falling to values close to 1
after 25 days. Social isolation measures were adopted quickly. Furthermore, it
was observed that public transport was avoided during the pandemic. Finally,
until the emergence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, this is the new
normal, and it must be understood that new patterns of mobility, social
interaction, and hygiene must be adapted to this reality.

  detection using CT Imaging","With the increase of COVID-19 cases worldwide, an effective way is required
to diagnose COVID-19 patients. The primary problem in diagnosing COVID-19
patients is the shortage and reliability of testing kits, due to the quick
spread of the virus, medical practitioners are facing difficulty identifying
the positive cases. The second real-world problem is to share the data among
the hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concerns of the
organizations. Building a collaborative model and preserving privacy are major
concerns for training a global deep learning model. This paper proposes a
framework that collects a small amount of data from different sources (various
hospitals) and trains a global deep learning model using blockchain based
federated learning. Blockchain technology authenticates the data and federated
learning trains the model globally while preserving the privacy of the
organization. First, we propose a data normalization technique that deals with
the heterogeneity of data as the data is gathered from different hospitals
having different kinds of CT scanners. Secondly, we use Capsule Network-based
segmentation and classification to detect COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, we design
a method that can collaboratively train a global model using blockchain
technology with federated learning while preserving privacy. Additionally, we
collected real-life COVID-19 patients data, which is, open to the research
community. The proposed framework can utilize up-to-date data which improves
the recognition of computed tomography (CT) images. Finally, our results
demonstrate a better performance to detect COVID-19 patients.

to use machine learning (ML), an artificial neural network (ANN) and a simple
statistical test to identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from full blood
counts without knowledge of symptoms or history of the individuals. The dataset
included in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood counts
results from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S\~ao
Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR
test during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the
hospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit
standard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers
to develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially
identify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. We find that with full blood counts
random forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2
patients with high accuracy between populations on regular wards (AUC = 94-95%)
and those not admitted to hospital or in the community (AUC=80-86%). Here, AUC
is the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve and a measure
for model performance. Moreover, a simple linear combination of 4 blood counts
can be used to have an AUC of 85% for patients within the community. The
normalised data of different blood parameters from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
exhibit a decrease in platelets, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and

  COVID-19","Countries highly exposed to incoming traffic from China were expected to be
at the highest risk of COVID-19 spread. However, COVID-19 case numbers
(infection levels) are negatively correlated with incoming traffic-level.
Moreover, infection levels are positively correlated with population-size,
while the latter should only affect infection-level once herd immunity is
reached. These could be explained if a low-virulence strain (LVS) began
spreading a few months earlier from China, providing immunity from the later
emerging known SARS-CoV-2 high-virulence strain (HVS). We find that the
dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic depend on the LVS and HVS spread
doubling-times and the delay between their initial onsets. We find that LVS
doubling-time to be $T_L\sim1.59\pm0.17$ times slower than the HVS ($T_H$), but
its earlier onset allowed its global wide-spread to the levels required for
herd-immunity. In countries exposed earlier to the LVS and/or having smaller
population-size, the LVS achieved herd-immunity earlier, allowing less time for
the spread of the HVS, and giving rise to lower HVS-infection levels. Such
model accurately predicts a country's infection-level ({\rm R^{2}=0.74};
p-value of {\rm 5.2\times10^{-13}}), given only its population-size and
incoming-traffic from China. It explains the negative correlation with
incoming-traffic ($c_{exp}$), the positive correlation with the population size
(n_{pop}) and their specific relations (${\rm N}_{{\rm cases}}\propto
n_{pop}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}}}}\times c_{exp}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}-1}}}$).
We find that most countries should have already achieved herd-immunity. Further
COVID-19-spread in these countries is limited and is not expected to rise by
more than a factor of 2-3. We suggest tests/predictions to further verify the
model and biologically identify the LVS, and discuss the implications.

coronavirus has rapidly become pandemics, mainly due to its extremely high
human-to-human transmission capability, and a surprisingly high viral charge of
symptom-less people. While the seek of a vaccine is still ongoing, promising
results have been obtained with antiviral compounds. In particular, lactoferrin
is found to have beneficial effects both in preventing and soothing the
infection. Here, we explore the possible molecular mechanisms with which
lactoferrin interferes with SARS-CoV-2 cell invasion, preventing attachment
and/or entry of the virus. To this aim, we search for possible interactions
lactoferrin may have with virus structural proteins and host receptors.
Representing the molecular iso-electron surface of proteins in terms of
2D-Zernike descriptors, we (i) identified putative regions on the lactoferrin
surface able to bind sialic acid receptors on the host cell membrane,
sheltering the cell from the virus attachment; (ii) showed that no significant
shape complementarity is present between lactoferrin and the ACE2 receptor,
while (iii) two high complementarity regions are found on the N- and C-terminal
domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, hinting at a possible competition

results in biased estimates of prevalence (too high). Typical post-sampling
corrections are not always possible. Here we present a simple bias correction

help us improve the understanding of the economic demand change, especially
when the macroeconomic is dramatically influenced by exogenous shocks like the
outbreak of COVID-19. At the beginning of the outbreak of COVID-19, in China's
stock market, spillover effects from industry indices of sectors meeting the
investment demand to those meeting the consumption demands rose significantly.
However, these spillover effects fell after the outbreak containment in China
appeared to be effective. Besides, some services sectors including utility,
transportation and information services have played increasingly important
roles in the networks of industry-specific volatility spillovers as of the
COVID-19 out broke. By implication, firstly, being led by Chinese government,
the COVID-19 is successfully contained and the work resumption is organized
with a high efficiency in China. The risk of the investment demand therefore
was controlled and eliminated relatively fast. Secondly, the intensive using of
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) led to supply restriction in services
in China. It will still be a potential threat for the Chinese economic recovery
in the next stage.

  measures and lower his/her turnover intention","An important theme is how to maximize the cooperation of employees when
dealing with crisis measures taken by the company. Therefore, to find out what
kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current
corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass
analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire
survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results
showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more
supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were
more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it
was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona
countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just
by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term
goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against
corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their
intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and
to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company
to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the
company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.

  India","COVID-19--a viral infectious disease--has quickly emerged as a global
pandemic infecting millions of people with a significant number of deaths
across the globe. The symptoms of this disease vary widely. Depending on the
symptoms an infected person is broadly classified into two categories namely,
asymptomatic and symptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals display mild or no
symptoms but continue to transmit the infection to otherwise healthy
individuals. This particular aspect of asymptomatic infection poses a major
obstacle in managing and controlling the transmission of the infectious
disease. In this paper, we attempt to mathematically model the spread of
COVID-19 in India under various intervention strategies. We consider SEIR type
epidemiological models, incorporated with India specific social contact matrix
representing contact structures among different age groups of the population.
Impact of various factors such as presence of asymptotic individuals, lockdown
strategies, social distancing practices, quarantine, and hospitalization on the
disease transmission is extensively studied. Numerical simulation of our model
is matched with the real COVID-19 data of India till May 15, 2020 for the

is seen to give a decent prediction for July 20, 2020.

  COVID-19 propagation","Raw data on the cumulative number of deaths at a country level generally
indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19
disease. An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a
consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions,
during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand
the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four
candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial
conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to
French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard
statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission
corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the
geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant
parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a
geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the
epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction
policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of
local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent
epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us
to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the
disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to
accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here,
in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is
of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.

computational modeling of chest radiographs (CXR) for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) patients. We also investigate the relative advantages of deep
learning (DL), radiomics, and DL of radiomic-embedded feature maps in
predicting these outcomes.
  Methods: This two-center, retrospective study analyzed deidentified CXRs
taken from 514 patients suspected of COVID-19 infection on presentation at
Stony Brook University Hospital (SBUH) and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center
(NBIMC) between the months of March and June 2020. A DL segmentation pipeline
was developed to generate masks for both lung fields and artifacts for each
CXR. Machine learning classifiers to predict mechanical ventilation requirement
and mortality were trained and evaluated on 353 baseline CXRs taken from
COVID-19 positive patients. A novel radiomic embedding framework is also
explored for outcome prediction.
  Results: Classification models for mechanical ventilation requirement (test
N=154) and mortality (test N=190) had AUCs of up to 0.904 and 0.936,
respectively. We also found that the inclusion of radiomic-embedded maps
improved DL model predictions of clinical outcomes.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate the potential for computerized analysis of
baseline CXR in predicting disease outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Our results
also suggest that radiomic embedding improves DL models in medical image
analysis, a technique that might be explored further in other pathologies. The
models proposed in this study and the prognostic information they provide,
complementary to other clinical data, might be used to aid physician decision
making and resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  and Tuberculosis Detection Using X-Ray Images in Resource Limited Settings","Clinicians in the frontline need to assess quickly whether a patient with
symptoms indeed has COVID-19 or not. The difficulty of this task is exacerbated
in low resource settings that may not have access to biotechnology tests.
Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low-
and middle-income countries and its common symptoms include fever, cough and
tiredness, similarly to COVID-19. In order to help in the detection of
COVID-19, we propose the extraction of deep features (DF) from chest X-ray
images, a technology available in most hospitals, and their subsequent
classification using machine learning methods that do not require large
computational resources. We compiled a five-class dataset of X-ray chest images
including a balanced number of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia,
TB, and healthy cases. We compared the performance of pipelines combining 14
individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with
traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50
for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the
best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection
accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the
same pipeline achieved accuracies of 98.6+1.4% and 99.9+0.5% in simpler
three-class and two-class classification problems focused on distinguishing
COVID-19, TB and healthy cases; and COVID-19 and healthy images, respectively.
The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to
extract DF per X-ray image and 2 minutes for training a traditional classifier
with more than 2000 images on a CPU machine. The results suggest the potential
benefits of using our pipeline in the detection of COVID-19, particularly in
resource-limited settings and it can run with limited computational resources.

  in Mainland China","As the recent COVID-19 outbreak rapidly expands all over the world, various
containment measures have been carried out to fight against the COVID-19
pandemic. In Mainland China, the containment measures consist of three types,
i.e., Wuhan travel ban, intra-city quarantine and isolation, and inter-city
travel restriction. In order to carry out the measures, local economy and
information acquisition play an important role. In this paper, we investigate
the correlation of local economy and the information acquisition on the
execution of containment measures to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in
Mainland China. First, we use a parsimonious model, i.e., SIR-X model, to
estimate the parameters, which represent the execution of intra-city quarantine
and isolation in major cities of Mainland China. In order to understand the
execution of intra-city quarantine and isolation, we analyze the correlation
between the representative parameters including local economy, mobility, and
information acquisition. To this end, we collect the data of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), the inflows from Wuhan and outflows, and the COVID-19 related
search frequency from a widely-used Web mapping service, i.e., Baidu Maps, and
Web search engine, i.e., Baidu Search Engine, in Mainland China. Based on the
analysis, we confirm the strong correlation between the local economy and the
execution of information acquisition in major cities of Mainland China. We
further evidence that, although the cities with high GDP per capita attracts
bigger inflows from Wuhan, people are more likely to conduct the quarantine
measure and to reduce going out to other cities. Finally, the correlation
analysis using search data shows that well-informed individuals are likely to
carry out containment measures.

  for Interpretable Prognosis","Due to the characteristics of COVID-19, the epidemic develops rapidly and
overwhelms health service systems worldwide. Many patients suffer from systemic
life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the
intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an
early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical
resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the
data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic
mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we
propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing
electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with
emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical
features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The
transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's
representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the
health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length
of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset.
The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently
outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1)
hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose
abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of
gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical
findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and
medical literatures.

to minimize a criterion consistent with the traditional requirements of the
validation of a probability density forecast. These requirements are both the
uniformity and the independence of the so-called probability integral
transforms, which are the forecast time-varying cumulated distributions applied
to the observations. We thus build a new numerical criterion incorporating both
the uniformity and independence properties by the mean of an adapted
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. We apply this method to financial markets during
the COVID-19 crisis. We determine the time-varying density of daily price
returns of several stock indices and, using various divergence statistics, we
are able to describe the chronology of the crisis as well as regional
disparities. For instance, we observe a more limited impact of COVID-19 on
financial markets in China, a strong impact in the US, and a slow recovery in
Europe.

concerns are emerging regarding confinement, tracing and testing. The
scientific debate concerning privacy of the COVID-19 tracing efforts has been
intense, especially focusing on the choice between centralised and
decentralised tracing apps. The privacy concerns regarding COVID-19 testing,
however, have not received as much attention even though the privacy at stake
is arguably even higher. COVID-19 tests require the collection of samples.
Those samples possibly contain viral material but inevitably also human DNA.
Patient DNA is not necessary for the test but it is technically impossible to
avoid collecting it. The unlawful preservation, or misuse, of such samples at a
massive scale may hence disclose patient DNA information with far-reaching
privacy consequences. Inspired by the cryptographic concept of
""Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack"", this paper poses the
blueprint of novel types of tests allowing to detect viral presence without
leaving persisting traces of the patient's DNA. Authors are listed in

  We conclude their randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial presents

outcomes is 72% after 0 days, 48.9% after 1 day and 29.3% after 2 days. For 3
days after exposure, the estimated relative reduction is 15.7% but results are
not statistically conclusive and for 4 or more days after exposure there is no

since infection, 1. The age distribution $n(t, a)$ of the population at time
$t$ can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial
differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. 2.
The frequency of type $i$ at time $t$ is simply obtained by integrating the
probability $p(a, i)$ of being in state $i$ at age a against the age
distribution $n(t, a)$. The advantage of this approach is three-fold. First,
regardless of the number of types, macroscopic observables (e.g., incidence or
prevalence of each type) only rely on a one-dimensional PDE ""decorated"" with
types. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the
McKendrick-von Foerster PDE with Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the
epidemic. We illustrate this technique using a French data from the COVID-19
epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard
compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models
can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet
equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity
of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a
universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based
epidemic models, here the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting
age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single
individual.

Finally, a known conspiracy theory was more likely to be ``laundered'' through
social media platforms than low-credibility news sources. In contrast,
misinformation reflecting legitimate scientific uncertainty was primarily
discussed by credible news sources. These results suggest that the social media
discourse reflects an attempt to come to grips with deep scientific uncertainty

social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population
densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling
for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship
between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social
capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection
rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus
infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.

required to reach the critical mass needed for effective contact tracing. As an
alternative, geo-location technologies in next generation networks (e.g., 5G)
can enable Mobile Operators (MOs) to perform passive tracing of users' mobility
and contacts with a promised accuracy of down to one meter. To effectively
detect contagions, the identities of positive individuals, which are known only
by a Governmental Authority (GA), are also required. Note that, besides being
extremely sensitive, these data might also be critical from a business
perspective. Hence, MOs and the GA need to exchange and process users'
geo-locations and infection status data in a privacy-preserving manner. In this
work, we propose a privacy-preserving protocol that enables multiple MOs and
the GA to share and process users' data to make only the final users discover
the number of their contacts with positive individuals. The protocol is based
on existing privacy-enhancing strategies that guarantee that users' mobility
and infection status are only known to their MOs and to the GA, respectively.
From extensive simulations, we observe that the cost to guarantee total privacy
(evaluated in terms of data overhead introduced by the protocol) is acceptable,

inductive fashion. This paper proposes an inductive RGCN for learning
informative relation embeddings even in the few-shot learning regime. The
proposed inductive model significantly outperforms the RGCN and
state-of-the-art KGE models in few-shot learning tasks. Furthermore, we apply
our method on the drug-repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG) for discovering drugs
for Covid-19. We pose the drug discovery task as link prediction and learn
embeddings for the biological entities that partake in the DRKG. Our initial
results corroborate that several drugs used in clinical trials were identified
as possible drug candidates. The method in this paper are implemented using the

with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states, and a mean of
15.2 days for Brazil. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability
density function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best
fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for
onset-to-hospital-admission. Our results show that epidemiological
distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first
estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting. At the
subnational level, variation in COVID-19 outcome timings are found to be
correlated with poverty, deprivation and segregation levels, and weaker
correlation is observed for mean age, wealth and urbanicity.

has been intensively studied, little work has been performed for image-based

intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, as a
majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of
disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial
presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume
information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based
image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging

need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the
first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging

thoroughly evaluated on datasets separately collected from three hospitals, one
in the United States, one in Iran, and another in Italy, with a total 295
patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay

non-imaging features can significantly improve the performance of prediction to
achieve AUC up to 0.884 and sensitivity as high as 96.1%, which can be valuable
to provide clinical decision support in managing COVID-19 patients. Our methods

consists of a GNN encoder that obtains node embeddings and four decoders, each
capturing different topological and node feature properties. Abiding to these
properties the novel unsupervised framework learns universal embeddings
applicable to different downstream tasks. PanRep can be furthered fine-tuned to
account for possible limited labels. In this operational setting PanRep is
considered as a pretrained model for extracting node embeddings of heterogenous

in node classification and link prediction, especially when the labeled data
for the supervised methods is small. PanRep-FT (with fine-tuning) outperforms
all other supervised approaches, which corroborates the merits of pretraining
models. Finally, we apply PanRep-FT for discovering novel drugs for Covid-19.

infection: 1) Patient's electronic health record is stored in a traditional
centralized database that could be stolen and tampered with the infection data,
2) The confidential personal identity of the infected user may be revealed to a
third party or organization, 3) Existing infection tracing systems do not trace
infections from multiple dimensions. Either the system is location-based or
individual-based tracing. In this work, we propose a global COVID-19

the automatically executed smart contracts are deployed so that users can get

of the Covid-19 pandemic evolution in France. The time series concerning the 13
regions of mainland France have been considered for fitting and validating the
model. An extremely simple, two-dimensional model with only two parameters
demonstrated to be able to reproduce the time series concerning the number of
daily demises caused by Covid-19, the hospitalizations, intensive care and
emergency accesses, the daily number of positive test and other indicators, for
the different French regions. These results might contribute to stimulate a
debate on the suitability of much more complex models for reproducing and
forecasting the pandemic evolution since, although relevant from a mechanistic
point of view, they could lead to nonidentifiability issues.

many countries around the globe, putting a significant burden on the health
sectors, affecting the macro economic conditions, and altering social
interactions amongst the population. In response, the academic community has
produced multiple forecasting models, approaches and algorithms to best predict
the different indicators of COVID-19, such as the number of confirmed infected
cases. Yet, researchers had little to no historical information about the
pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our
work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the
pandemic to better understand their fundamental uncertainty and the impact of
data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19
infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd
June 2020 to predict, through a rolling window backtesting framework, the
cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement
three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this
6-month span, a baseline model that always predicts the last known value of the
cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model
called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the
pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic,
errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country
exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future
confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting
framework to accurately assess the predictive power of such models at any point
in time during the outbreak which in turn can be used to assign the right level
of certainty to these forecasts and facilitate better planning.

  with application to COVID-19 detection","Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets,
knowledge transfer from pre-trained models showed outstanding performance in
medical image classification. However, building a robust image classification
model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very
challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised
Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model. 4S-DT
encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image
recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a
generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is
a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample
decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the
robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with
a class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data. 4S-DT
can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its
class boundaries using a downstream class-decomposition mechanism. We used
50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer
learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has
achieved a high accuracy of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.44%, 99.98%) in the detection of
COVID-19 cases on a large dataset and an accuracy of 97.54% (95%$ CI: 96.22%,
98.91%) on an extended test set enriched by augmented images of a small
dataset, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the
highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.

among others are aimed at automatising and globalising the prompt alerting of

posed by the Covid-19 pandemic by restricting their export of medical supplies.
Such measures are meant to increase the domestic availability of critical
goods, and are commonly used in times of crisis. Yet, not much is known about
their impact, especially on countries imposing them. Here we show that export
bans are, by and large, counterproductive. Using a model of shock diffusion
through the network of international trade, we simulate the impact of
restrictions under different scenarios. We observe that while they would be
beneficial to a country implementing them in isolation, their generalized use
makes most countries worse off relative to a no-ban scenario. As a corollary,
we estimate that prices increase in many countries imposing the restrictions.
We also find that the cost of restraining from export bans is small, even when
others continue to implement them. Finally, we document a change in countries'
position within the international trade network, suggesting that export bans
have geopolitical implications.

  to flatten the curve of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan","This paper presents the assessment of time-dependent national-level
restrictions and control actions and their effects in fighting the COVID-19
pandemic. By analysing the transmission dynamics during the first wave of
COVID-19 in the country, the effectiveness of the various levels of control
actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood.
This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control
the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic
population model for the pandemic is firstly developed to take into
consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters,
especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one
of the critical measures used to describe the transmission dynamics of this
pandemic. The reproduction number alongside other key parameters of the model
can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical
optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in
the news platforms. In this paper, the model is verified using a case study
based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in
simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints)
parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with
time-dependent control measures so as to determine which would reflect on the
actual situations better.

multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief
utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify a
constraint to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for
each resource. Such constraints often arise from location constraints (e.g.
among all of the volunteer nurses, only those who live nearby can work at
hospital A due to commute constraints. So hospital A can only receive
allocations of volunteers from a subset of the total supply). This can also
model a type of substitute effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A
\emph{or} B, but some other agents specifically want A, and some specifically
want B. We propose a new mechanism called Group Dominant Resource Fairness
which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs.
The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness,
strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first mechanism to achieve all four
properties in our setting. Furthermore, we show numerically that our method
scales better to large problems than alternative approaches. Finally, although
motivated by the problem of medical resource allocation in a pandemic, our
mechanism can be applied more broadly to resource allocation under Leontief
utilities with accessibility constraints.

  based on Social Media Comments using Natural Language Processing","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis that affects many
aspects of human lives. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, several
behavioural change and policy initiatives, such as physical distancing, have
been implemented to control the spread of the coronavirus. Social media data
can reveal public perceptions toward how governments and health agencies across
the globe are handling the pandemic, as well as the impact of the disease on
people regardless of their geographic locations in line with various factors
that hinder or facilitate the efforts to control the spread of the pandemic
globally. This paper aims to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
people globally using social media data. We apply natural language processing
(NLP) and thematic analysis to understand public opinions, experiences, and
issues with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic using social media data. First, we
collect over 47 million COVID-19-related comments from Twitter, Facebook,
YouTube, and three online discussion forums. Second, we perform data
preprocessing which involves applying NLP techniques to clean and prepare the
data for automated theme extraction. Third, we apply context-aware NLP approach
to extract meaningful keyphrases or themes from over 1 million randomly
selected comments, as well as compute sentiment scores for each theme and
assign sentiment polarity based on the scores using lexicon-based technique.
Fourth, we categorize related themes into broader themes. A total of 34
negative themes emerged, out of which 15 are health-related issues,
psychosocial issues, and social issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic from
the public perspective. In addition, 20 positive themes emerged from our
results. Finally, we recommend interventions that can help address the negative
issues based on the positive themes and other remedial ideas rooted in
research.

  for interdisciplinary research","Research on infodemics, i.e., the rapid spread of (mis)information related to
a hazardous event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires the integration of a
multiplicity of scientific disciplines. The dynamics emerging from infodemics
have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. In order to react
appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and
Economics to understand the dynamics emerging from it. In the short run,
dynamics might lead to an adaptation in household spending or to a shift in
buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run, changes in
investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that
the dynamics emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as
information and misinformation accessible for individuals and the formation and
revision of beliefs. (Mis)information accessible to individuals is, amongst
others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized
information, while automated fact-checking algorithms can help reduce the
amount of circulating misinformation. The formation and revision of individual
(and probably false) beliefs and individual fact-checking and interpretation of
information are heavily affected by linguistic patterns inherent to information
during pandemics and infodemics and further factors, such as affect, intuition
and motives. We argue that, in order to get a deep(er) understanding of the
dynamics emerging from infodemics, the fields of Business and Economics should
integrate the perspectives of Computer Science and Information Systems,
(Computational) Linguistics, and Cognitive Science into the wider context of
economic systems (e.g., organizations, markets or industries) and propose a way
to do so.

infecting millions of people since the first notification until nowadays.
Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow knowing the number of
future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in
the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge
regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble
learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three,
and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian
states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking learning approach, the
cubist, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian
process (GP) as meta-learner. The models' effectiveness is evaluated based on
the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute
percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking ensemble
learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared
models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting,
achieving errors in a range of 0.87% - 3.51%, 1.02% - 5.63%, and 0.95% - 6.90%
in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models in all
scenarios is SVR, stacking ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF

the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers
in the decision-making support systems.

  Imposed U-Net","The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major
outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe
impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of mid-July 2020,
more than 12 million people were infected, and more than 570,000 death were
reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as an alternative to the
time-consuming RT-PCR test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we propose a
segmentation framework to detect chest regions in CT images, which are infected
by COVID-19. We use an architecture similar to U-Net model, and train it to
detect ground glass regions, on pixel level. As the infected regions tend to
form a connected component (rather than randomly distributed pixels), we add a
suitable regularization term to the loss function, to promote connectivity of
the segmentation map for COVID-19 pixels. 2D-anisotropic total-variation is
used for this purpose, and therefore the proposed model is called ""TV-UNet"".
Through experimental results on a relatively large-scale CT segmentation
dataset of around 900 images, we show that adding this new regularization term
leads to 2\% gain on overall segmentation performance compared to the U-Net
model. Our experimental analysis, ranging from visual evaluation of the
predicted segmentation results to quantitative assessment of segmentation
performance (precision, recall, Dice score, and mIoU) demonstrated great
ability to identify COVID-19 associated regions of the lungs, achieving a mIoU
rate of over 99\%, and a Dice score of around 86\%.

  Infectious Diseases such as COVID-19","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is unfolding as a major
international crisis whose influence extends to every aspect of our daily
lives. Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus
reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart
the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be
greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers
information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine
whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus
typically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing
individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via
a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing
their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such
strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is
especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days
after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many
COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy
strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare
up in the future.
  In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential
learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to
the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through
various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies
that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on
policy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance
bounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as
well as in the tests themselves.

of infectious diseases in geographical domains. The model is designed to
simulate the spatiotemporal spread of SARS-CoV2 disease, known as COVID-19. Our
SARS-CoV2-based ABM framework (CoV-ABM) simulates the spread at any
geographical scale, ranging from a village to a country and considers unique
characteristics of SARS-CoV2 viruses such as its persistence in the
environment. Therefore, unlike other simulators, CoV-ABM computes the density
of active viruses inside each location space to get the virus transmission
probability for each agent. It also uses the local census and health data to
create health and risk factor profiles for each individual. The proposed model
relies on a flexible timestamp scale to optimize the computational speed and
the level of detail. In our framework each agent represents a person
interacting with the surrounding space and other adjacent agents inside the
same space. Moreover, families stochastic daily tasks are formulated to get
tracked by the corresponding family members. The model also formulates the
possibility of meetings for each subset of friendships and relatives. The main
aim of the proposed framework is threefold: to illustrate the dynamics of
SARS-CoV diseases, to identify places which have a higher probability to become
infection hubs and to provide a decision-support system to design efficient
interventions in order to fight against pandemics. The framework employs SEIHRD
dynamics of viral diseases with different intervention scenarios. The paper
simulates the spread of COVID-19 in the State of Delaware, United States, with
near one million stochastic agents. The results achieved over a period of 15

  COVID-19 Daily Cases in the US: A Google Trends Analysis","The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has affected virtually every region of the
globe. At the time of conducting this study, the number of daily cases in the
United States is more than any other country, and the trend is increasing in
most of its states. Google trends provide public interest in various topics
during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods
might provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.
The objective of this study was to consider the predictive ability of different
search terms (i.e., bars and restaurants) with regards to the increase of daily
cases in the US. We considered the causation of two different search query
trends, namely restaurant and bars, on daily positive cases in top-10
states/territories of the United States with the highest and lowest daily new
positive cases. In addition, to measure the linear relation of different
trends, we used Pearson correlation. Our results showed for states/territories
with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries
related to bars and restaurants, which mainly happened after re-opening,
significantly affect the daily new cases, on average. California, for example,
had most searches for restaurants on June 7th, 2020, which affected the number
of new cases within two weeks after the peak with the P-value of .004 for
Granger's causality test. Although a limited number of search queries were
considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant
effect on daily new cases for regions with higher numbers of daily new cases in
the United States. We showed that such influential search trends could be used
as additional information for prediction tasks in new cases of each region.
This prediction can help healthcare leaders manage and control the impact of
COVID-19 outbreaks on society and be prepared for the outcomes.

  have impact","Scientific knowledge and advances are a cornerstone of modern society. They
improve our understanding of the world we live in and help us navigate global
challenges including emerging infectious diseases, climate change and the
biodiversity crisis. For any scientist, whether they work primarily in
fundamental knowledge generation or in the applied sciences, it is important to
understand how science fits into a decision-making framework. Decision science
is a field that aims to pinpoint evidence-based management strategies. It
provides a framework for scientists to directly impact decisions or to
understand how their work will fit into a decision process. Decision science is
more than undertaking targeted and relevant scientific research or providing
tools to assist policy makers; it is an approach to problem formulation,
bringing together mathematical modelling, stakeholder values and logistical
constraints to support decision making. In this paper we describe decision
science, its use in different contexts, and highlight current gaps in
methodology and application. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust mathematical
models into the public spotlight, but it is one of innumerable examples in
which modelling informs decision making. Other examples include models of storm
systems (eg. cyclones, hurricanes) and climate change. Although the decision
timescale in these examples differs enormously (from hours to decades), the
underlying decision science approach is common across all problems. Bridging
communication gaps between different groups is one of the greatest challenges
for scientists. However, by better understanding and engaging with the
decision-making processes, scientists will have greater impact and make
stronger contributions to important societal problems.

unseen countries, and their sensitivity to unobserved factors. Models that
account for noise in disease transmission compare favourably. We further

of evaluating two potential binding sites speculated to participate in host

deep mining of all existing protein structures (using PDBMine), and binding
site recognition (using msTALI) to examine the two sites consisting of residues
55-59 and 73-80. Based on our preliminary results, we conclude that the
residues 73-80 appear as the regions that facilitate the critical initial steps
in the function of nsp1. Given the 90% sequence identity between nsp1 from

  Classification","A central mechanism in machine learning is to identify, store, and recognize
patterns. How to learn, access, and retrieve such patterns is crucial in
Hopfield networks and the more recent transformer architectures. We show that
the attention mechanism of transformer architectures is actually the update
rule of modern Hopfield networks that can store exponentially many patterns. We
exploit this high storage capacity of modern Hopfield networks to solve a
challenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology:
immune repertoire classification. Accurate and interpretable machine learning
methods solving this problem could pave the way towards new vaccines and
therapies, which is currently a very relevant research topic intensified by the
COVID-19 crisis. Immune repertoire classification based on the vast number of
immunosequences of an individual is a MIL problem with an unprecedentedly
massive number of instances, two orders of magnitude larger than currently
considered problems, and with an extremely low witness rate. In this work, we
present our novel method DeepRC that integrates transformer-like attention, or
equivalently modern Hopfield networks, into deep learning architectures for
massive MIL such as immune repertoire classification. We demonstrate that
DeepRC outperforms all other methods with respect to predictive performance on

  dispatch","Operating a modern power grid reliably in case of SCADA/EMS failure or amid
difficult times like COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging task for grid
operators. In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation dispatch scheme has been
proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing;
however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for
computing and communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises
server and dispatch communication system, proposes and implements a
cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation continuity
regardless of local infrastructure's availability and accessibility. Through
its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution
has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is
independent and fault-tolerant, providing grid monitoring and control
capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or when
operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the
overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to
the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to ""serverless"", the burden of the server
provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of
using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is
architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service
(FaaS) model. This work also develops a comprehensive cyber security mechanism
to comply with critical infrastructure requirements for the power grid, which
can serve as an exemplary framework for other grid operators to secure their
cloud services.

also factors in the state of the public healthcare system. Our model allows us
to generate qualitative projections of Covid-19 spread in India, and further
allows us to investigate the effects of different proposed interventions. By
building in heterogeneity at geographical and infrastructural levels and in
local responses, our model aims to capture some of the complexity of
epidemiological modeling appropriate to a diverse country such as India.

  Network","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic that has
spread rapidly since December 2019. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and chest computed tomography (CT) imaging both play
an important role in COVID-19 diagnosis. Chest CT imaging offers the benefits
of quick reporting, a low cost, and high sensitivity for the detection of
pulmonary infection. Recently, deep-learning-based computer vision methods have
demonstrated great promise for use in medical imaging applications, including
X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging, and CT imaging. However, training a
deep-learning model requires large volumes of data, and medical staff faces a
high risk when collecting COVID-19 CT data due to the high infectivity of the
disease. Another issue is the lack of experts available for data labeling. In
order to meet the data requirements for COVID-19 CT imaging, we propose a CT
image synthesis approach based on a conditional generative adversarial network
that can effectively generate high-quality and realistic COVID-19 CT images for
use in deep-learning-based medical imaging tasks. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art image synthesis
methods with the generated COVID-19 CT images and indicates promising for
various machine learning applications including semantic segmentation and
classification.

another through social contact networks. In today's interconnected global
society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as
exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great
practical relevance to investigate the network trans-mission of contagious
diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely
studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the
so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in
determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will
cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds
from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major
challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the
epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally
efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu
modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk
sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small
fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and
demonstrate their empirical superiority.

  conditions","Containment measures implemented by some countries to suppress the spread of
COVID-19 have resulted in a slowdown of the epidemic characterized by time
series of daily infections plateauing over extended periods of time. We prove
that such a dynamical pattern is compatible with critical
Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) dynamics. In traditional analyses of the
critical SIR model, the critical dynamical regime is started from a single
infected node. The application of containment measures to an ongoing epidemic,
however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a
number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such
non-trivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model.
We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model.
We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the
initial number of infected individuals, while the expected duration of the
outbreak is a non-monotonic function of the initial number of infected
individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations
associated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics
with non-trivial initial conditions. Far from heard immunity, fluctuations are
much larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing
time series may be particularly challenging.

  Immunity and Quarantine: A Metric Temporal Logic Approach","Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health
control strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirus
SARS-CoV-2. We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the
susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination
control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible,
un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model
with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal
logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can
specify the expected control outcomes such as ""the deaths from the infection
should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months"" or ""the
population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within
the next 100 to 120 days"". We then develop methods for synthesizing control
strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the
COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation
results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19
epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield
immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from
data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with
model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the
proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the
time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune)
satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention
is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is
needed for more stringent MTL specifications.

Prior research indicates that human mobility is one of the key factors involved
in viral spreading. Indeed, in a connected planet, rapid world-wide spread is
enabled by long-distance air-, land- and sea-transportation among countries and
continents, and subsequently fostered by commuting trips within densely
populated cities. While early travel restrictions contribute to delayed disease
spread, their utility is much reduced if the disease has a long incubation
period or if there is asymptomatic transmission. Given the lack of vaccines,
public health officials have mainly relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions,
including social distancing measures, curfews, and stay-at-home orders. Here we
study the impact of city organization on its susceptibility to disease spread,
and amenability to interventions. Cities can be classified according to their
mobility in a spectrum between compact-hierarchical and decentralized-sprawled.
Our results show that even though hierarchical cities are more susceptible to
the rapid spread of epidemics, their organization makes mobility restrictions
quite effective. Conversely, sprawled cities are characterized by a much slower
initial spread, but are less responsive to mobility restrictions. These
findings hold globally across cities in diverse geographical locations and a
broad range of sizes. Our empirical measurements are confirmed by a simulation
of COVID-19 spread in urban areas through a compartmental model. These results
suggest that investing resources on early monitoring and prompt ad-hoc
interventions in more vulnerable cities may prove most helpful in containing
and reducing the impact of present and future pandemics.

choice of which individuals should be tested has an important impact on the
effectiveness of selective confinement measures. This decision problem is
closely related to the problem of optimal sensor selection, which is a very
active research subject in control engineering. The goal of this paper is to
propose a policy to smartly select the individuals to be tested. The main idea
is to model the epidemics as a stochastic dynamic system and to select the
individual to be tested accordingly to some optimality criteria, e.g. to
minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the
probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of
the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the
previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10000 individuals show
that the proposed technique, coupled with a selective confinement policy, can
reduce the spread of the disease while limiting the number of individuals
confined if compared to the simple contact tracing of positive and to an
off-line test selection strategy based on the number of contacts.

  Recession","The COVID-19 recession that started in March 2020 led to an unprecedented
decline in economic activity across the globe. To fight this recession, policy
makers in central banks engaged in expansionary monetary policy. This paper
asks whether the measures adopted by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) have been
effective in boosting real activity and calming financial markets. To measure
these effects at high frequencies, we propose a novel mixed frequency vector
autoregressive (MF-VAR) model. This model allows us to combine weekly and
monthly information within an unified framework. Our model combines a set of
macroeconomic aggregates such as industrial production, unemployment rates and
inflation with high frequency information from financial markets such as stock
prices, interest rate spreads and weekly information on the Feds balance sheet
size. The latter set of high frequency time series is used to dynamically
interpolate the monthly time series to obtain weekly macroeconomic measures. We
use this setup to simulate counterfactuals in absence of monetary stimulus. The
results show that the monetary expansion caused higher output growth and stock
market returns, more favorable long-term financing conditions and a
depreciation of the US dollar compared to a no-policy benchmark scenario.

  Hospitalization in Patients with Suspected COVID-19","The controversy of computed tomography (CT) use in COVID-19 screening is
associated with ambiguous characteristics of chest CT as a diagnostic test. The
reported values of CT sensitivity and specificity calculated using RT-PCR as a
reference standard vary widely. The objective of this study was to reevaluate
the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT using an alternative approach. This
study included 973 symptomatic COVID-19 patients aged 42 $\pm$ 17 years, 56%
females. We reviewed the disease dynamics between the initial and follow-up CT
studies using a ""CT0-4"" grading system. Sensitivity and specificity were
calculated as conditional probabilities that a patient's condition would
improve or deteriorate relative to the initial CT study results. For the
calculation of negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values, we
estimated the COVID-19 prevalence in Moscow. We used several ARIMA and EST
models with different parameters to fit the data on total cases of COVID-19
from March 6, 2020, to July 20, 2020, and forecast the incidence. The ""CT0-4""
grading scale demonstrated low sensitivity (28%) but high specificity (95%).
The best statistical model for describing the pandemic in Moscow was ETS with
multiplicative trend, error, and season type. According to our calculations,
with the predicted prevalence of 2.1%, the values of NPV and PPV would be 98%
and 10%, correspondingly. We associate the low sensitivity and PPV values with
the small sample size of the patients with severe symptoms and non-optimal
methodological setup for measuring these specific characteristics. The ""CT0-4""
grading scale was highly specific and predictive for identifying admissions to
hospitals of COVID-19 patients. Despite the ambiguous accuracy, chest CT proved
to be an effective practical tool for patient management during the pandemic,
provided that the necessary infrastructure and human resources are available.

segmented with a mean absolute volume error of 91.3 ml. In general, the task of
distinguishing different lesion types was more difficult, with a mean absolute
volume difference of 152 ml and mean Dice scores of 0.369 and 0.523 for

  Information Workers in a Natural Experiment During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a wide-ranging impact on information workers
such as higher stress levels, increased workloads, new workstreams, and more
caregiving responsibilities during lockdown. COVID-19 also caused the
overwhelming majority of information workers to rapidly shift to working from
home (WFH). The central question this work addresses is: can we isolate the
effects of WFH on information workers' collaboration activities from all other
factors, especially the other effects of COVID-19? This is important because in
the future, WFH will likely to be more common than it was prior to the
pandemic.
  We use difference-in-differences (DiD), a causal identification strategy
commonly used in the social sciences, to control for unobserved confounding
factors and estimate the causal effect of WFH. Our analysis relies on measuring
the difference in changes between those who WFH prior to COVID-19 and those who
did not. Our preliminary results suggest that on average, people spent more
time on collaboration in April (Post WFH mandate) than in February (Pre WFH
mandate), but this is primarily due to factors other than WFH, such as
lockdowns during the pandemic. The change attributable to WFH specifically is
in the opposite direction: less time on collaboration and more focus time. This
reversal shows the importance of using causal inference: a simple analysis
would have resulted in the wrong conclusion. We further find that the effect of
WFH is moderated by individual remote collaboration experience prior to WFH.
Meanwhile, the medium for collaboration has also shifted due to WFH: instant
messages were used more, whereas scheduled meetings were used less. We discuss
design implications -- how future WFH may affect focused work, collaborative
work, and creative work.

epidemic around the Globe. New evidence is needed on how to mitigate the job
market crisis, but there exists only a handful of studies mostly focusing on
developed countries. We fill in this gap in the literature by using novel data
from Ukraine, a transition country in Eastern Europe, which enacted strict
quarantine policies early on. We model four binary outcomes to identify
respondents (i) who are not working during quarantine, (ii) those who are more
likely to work from home, (iii) respondents who are afraid of losing a job,
and, finally, (iv) survey participants who have savings for 1 month or less if
quarantine is further extended. Our findings suggest that respondents employed
in public administration, programming and IT, as well as highly qualified
specialists, were more likely to secure their jobs during the quarantine.
Females, better educated respondents, and those who lived in Kyiv were more
likely to work remotely. Working in the public sector also made people more
confident about their future employment perspectives. Although our findings are
limited to urban households only, they provide important early evidence on the
correlates of job market outcomes, expectations, and financial security,
indicating potential deterioration of socio-economic inequalities.

Covid-19 in Spain in the period 01-31-2020 / 06-01-2020 by Autonomous
Communities. Based on these estimates, this work allows us to accurately
re-estimate the lethality of the disease in Spain, taking into account
unreported cases. A hierarchical Bayesian model recently proposed in the
literature has been adapted to model the actual number of Covid-19 cases in
Spain. The results of this work show that the real load of Covid-19 in Spain in
the period considered is well above the data registered by the public health
system. Specifically, the model estimates show that, cumulatively until June
1st, 2020, there were 2,425,930 cases of Covid-19 in Spain with characteristics
similar to those reported (95\% credibility interval: 2,148,261 - 2,813,864),
from which were actually registered only 518,664. Considering the results
obtained from the second wave of the Spanish seroprevalence study, which
estimates 2,350,324 cases of Covid-19 produced in Spain, in the period of time
considered, it can be seen that the estimates provided by the model are quite
good. This work clearly shows the key importance of having good quality data to
optimize decision-making in the critical context of dealing with a pandemic.

this impacts negatively towards work productivity and other related parameters

that causes this negative work experience is directly linked to the available
seating arrangements. In this paper, we conduct an analysis to understand
various seating preferences of 37 workers with varying demographics, using the

workplace settings. We also discuss a list of implications illustrating how our
findings can be adapted across wider hybrid work settings.

deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific
domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually
important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly
follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on
discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs enable important features to be
discovered with control of the FDR. However, knockoffs require rich generative
models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they
obey the so-called ""swap"" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs
(DDLK), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap
property. DDLK consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit
likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint
distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure
that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, DDLK uses the
Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case
swap. We find DDLK has higher power than baselines while controlling the false
discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task
involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.

dynamics. WHO states that there is currently no evidence that people who have
recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are immune from a second infection

study the case where infected agents recover and only develop immunity if they
are continuously infected for some time. Otherwise, they become susceptible
again. We show that field theory bounds the peak of the infectious rate.
Consequently, the theory's phases characterise the disease dynamics: (i) a
pandemic phase and (ii) a response regime. The model excellently describes the
epidemic spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. We find
that only 30% of the recovered agents have developed an immunity. We anticipate
our paper to influence the decision making upon balancing the economic impact
and the pandemic impact on society. As long as disease controlling measures
keep the disease dynamics in the ""response regime"", a pandemic escalation
('second wave') is ruled out.

additional advantages. Here, we investigate the properties of propensity score

  outbreaks","Without vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical
intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as
COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it
eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent
studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing
epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between
wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory
has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function
of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an
analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic
closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase
predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease,
as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we
demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally
effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our
results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models
where infectivity and recovery show significant variability.

while others mainly have shown weak or no efficiency. Subsequently, the VINI
model calculated the inhibition efficiency of all possible double and triple

except the combination of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine appear to have

infections. Face masks have become increasingly accepted as one of the most
effective means for combating the spread of the disease, when used in
combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However, there is
an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with
clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One
of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to
regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of
these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation
efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these
alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the
performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of
aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields
block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move
around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending
on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an
exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the
exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a
means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the
community spread of COVID-19, it may be preferable to use high quality cloth or

  Strategies For Addressing The COVID-19 Pandemic","We study and predict the evolution of Covid-19 in six US states from the
period May 1 through August 31 using a discrete compartment-based model and
prescribe active intervention policies, like lockdowns, on the basis of
minimizing a loss function, within the broad framework of partially observed
Markov decision processes. For each state, Covid-19 data for 40 days (starting
from May 1 for two northern states and June 1 for four southern states) are
analyzed to estimate the transition probabilities between compartments and
other parameters associated with the evolution of the epidemic. These
quantities are then used to predict the course of the epidemic in the given
state for the next 50 days (test period) under various policy allocations,
leading to different values of the loss function over the training horizon. The
optimal policy allocation is the one corresponding to the smallest loss. Our
analysis shows that none of the six states need lockdowns over the test period,
though the no lockdown prescription is to be interpreted with caution:
responsible mask use and social distancing of course need to be continued. The
caveats involved in modeling epidemic propagation of this sort are discussed at
length. A sketch of a non-Markovian formulation of Covid-19 propagation (and
more general epidemic propagation) is presented as an attractive avenue for
future research in this area.

  during COVID-19: Transform-and-Divide Evolutionary Optimization","Balancing common disease treatment and epidemic control is a key objective of
medical supplies procurement in hospitals during a pandemic such as COVID-19.
This problem can be formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem for
simultaneously optimizing the effects of common disease treatment and epidemic
control. However, due to the large number of supplies, difficulties in
evaluating the effects, and the strict budget constraint, it is difficult for
existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms to efficiently approximate the
Pareto front of the problem. In this paper, we present an approach that first
transforms the original high-dimensional, constrained multiobjective
optimization problem to a low-dimensional, unconstrained multiobjective
optimization problem, and then evaluates each solution to the transformed
problem by solving a set of simple single-objective optimization subproblems,
such that the problem can be efficiently solved by existing evolutionary
multiobjective algorithms. We applied the transform-and-divide evolutionary
optimization approach to six hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, during the
peak of COVID-19. Results showed that the proposed approach exhibits
significantly better performance than that of directly solving the original
problem. Our study has also shown that transform-and-divide evolutionary
optimization based on problem-specific knowledge can be an efficient solution
approach to many other complex problems and, therefore, enlarge the application
field of evolutionary algorithms.

contacts by using COVID-19 tracing apps. A reliable classification is crucial
to ensure a high level of protection, and at the same time to prevent many
people from being sent to quarantine by the app. Tracing apps are based on the
capabilities of current smartphones to enable a broadest possible availability.
Existing capabilities of smartphones include the exchange of Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE) signals and of audio signals, as well as the use of gyroscopes and
magnetic sensors. The Bluetooth power measurements, which are often used today,
may be complemented by audio ranging and attitude estimation in the future.
Smartphones are worn in different ways, often in pockets and bags, which makes
the propagation of signals and thus the classification rather unpredictable.
Relying on the cooperation of users to wear their phones hanging from their
neck would change the situation considerably. In this case the performance,
achievable with BLE and audio measurements, becomes predictable. Our analysis
identifies parameters that result in accurate warnings, at least within the
scope of validity of the models. A significant reduction of the spreading of
the disease can then be achieved by the apps, without causing many people to
unduly go to quarantine. The present paper is the first of three papers which
analyze the situation in some detail.

humankind and is being considered the most crucial health calamity of the
century. One of the best methods of detecting COVID-19 is from radiological
images, namely X-rays and Computed Tomography or CT scan images. Many companies
and educational organizations have come together during this crisis and created
various Deep Learning models for the effective diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest
radiography images. For example, the University of Waterloo, along with Darwin
AI, has designed its Deep Learning model COVID-Net and created a dataset called
COVIDx, consisting of 13,975 images. In this study, COGNEXs Deep Learning
Software-VisionPro Deep Learning is used to classify these Chest X-rays from
the COVIDx dataset. The results are compared with the results of COVID-Net and
various other state of the art Deep Learning models from the open-source
community. Deep Learning tools are often referred to as black boxes because
humans cannot interpret how or why a model is classifying an image into a
particular class. This problem is addressed by testing VisionPro Deep Learning
with two settings, firstly by selecting the entire image, that is, selecting
the entire image as the Region of Interest-ROI, and secondly by segmenting the
lungs in the first step, and then doing the classification step on the
segmented lungs only, instead of using the entire image. VisionPro Deep
Learning results-on the entire image as the ROI it achieves an overall F-score
of 94.0 percent, and on the segmented lungs, it gets an F-score of 95.3
percent, which is at par or better than COVID-Net and other state of the art

  Limits of Veritistic Countermeasures","The COVID-19 pandemic has been the subject of a vast amount of
misinformation, particularly in digital information environments, and major
social media platforms recently publicized some of the countermeasures they are
adopting. This presents an opportunity to examine the nature of the
misinformation and disinformation being produced, and the theoretical and
technological paradigm used to counter it. I argue that this approach is based
on a conception of misinformation as epistemic pollution that can only justify
a limited and potentially inadequate response , and that some of the measures
undertaken in practice outrun this. In fact, social networks manage ecological
and architectural conditions that influence discourse on their platforms in
ways that should motivate reconsideration of the justifications that ground
epistemic interventions to combat misinformation, and the types of intervention
that they warrant. The editorial role of platforms should not be framed solely
as the management of epistemic pollution, but instead as managing the epistemic
environment in which narratives and social epistemic processes take place.
There is an element of inevitable epistemic paternalism involved in this, and
exploration of the independent constraints on its justifiability can help
determine proper limits of its exercise in practice.

particular response function such as linear, quadratic, etc. and need the data
to 'speak for themselves'. GAMs do this via the smoothing functions and take
each predictor variable in the model and separate it into sections delimited by
'knots', and then fit polynomial functions to each section separately, with the
constraint that there are no links at the knots - second derivatives of the
separate functions are equal at the knots.

we propose a solution for the life-or-economy dilemma that does not require

transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only
relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective
Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search
mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and
maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely
Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility.
The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to
generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a
well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation
between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two
exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it
get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD
dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low
level while retaining 76\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is

worldwide. The combination of a public health emergency, economic distress, and
misinformation-driven panic have pushed customers and vendors towards the
shadow economy. In particular, dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial

Here, we analyse 851,199 listings extracted from 30 DWMs between January 1,
2020 and November 16, 2020. We identify 788 listings directly related to
COVID-19 products and monitor the temporal evolution of product categories
including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medicines (e.g.,
hydroxyclorochine), and medical frauds. Finally, we compare trends in their
temporal evolution with variations in public attention, as measured by Twitter
posts and Wikipedia page visits. We reveal how the online shadow economy has
evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of a
continuous monitoring of DWMs, especially now that real vaccines are available
and in short supply. We anticipate our analysis will be of interest both to
researchers and public agencies focused on the protection of public health.

Precisely, we move from the idea that the volume of Google searches about

stock index prices, can be used to produce mood indicators -- in terms of
pessimism and optimism -- at country level. We analyse the ""very high human

their respective main stock market indexes. Namely, we propose both a temporal
and a global measure of pessimism and optimism and provide accordingly a
classification of indexes and countries. The results show the existence of
different clusters of countries and markets in terms of pessimism and optimism.
Moreover, specific regimes along the time emerge, with an increasing optimism
spreading during the mid of June 2020. Furthermore, countries with different
government responses to the pandemic have experienced different levels of mood
indicators, so that countries with less strict lockdown had a higher level of
optimism.

the localized volume of activity in a defined area and the proportion of
activity occurring in non-residential and outdoor land uses. We utilize this
approach to capture inflows/outflows of people as a result of the pandemic and
changes in mobility behavior for those that remain. First, we develop a
generalizable method for assessing neighborhood activity levels by land use
type using smartphone geolocation data over a three-month period covering more
than 12 million unique users within the Greater New York area. Second, we
measure and analyze disparities in community social distancing by identifying
patterns in neighborhood activity levels and characteristics before and after
the stay-at-home order. Finally, we evaluate the effect of social distancing in
neighborhoods on COVID-19 infection rates and outcomes associated with
localized demographic, socioeconomic, and infrastructure characteristics in
order to identify disparities in health outcomes related to exposure risk. Our
findings provide insight into the timely evaluation of the effectiveness of
social distancing for individual neighborhoods and support a more equitable
allocation of resources to support vulnerable and at-risk communities. Our
findings demonstrate distinct patterns of activity pre- and post-COVID across

findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed system for assisting

  Traffic Volume, Air Quality, and the Prevalence of COVID-19 Outcomes in Urban
  Neighborhoods","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented policies
to curb the spread of the novel virus. Little is known about how these policies
impact various groups in society. This paper explores the relationship between
social distancing policies, traffic volumes and air quality and how they impact
various socioeconomic groups. This study aims to understand how disparate
communities respond to Stay-at-Home Orders and other social distancing policies
to understand how human behavior in response to policy may play a part in the
prevalence of COVID-19 positive cases. We collected data on traffic density,
air quality, socio-economic status, and positive cases rates of COVID-19 for
each zip code of Salt Lake County, Utah (USA) between February 17 and June 12,
2020. We studied the impact of social distancing policies across three periods
of policy implementation. We found that wealthier and whiter zip codes
experienced a greater reduction in traffic and air pollution during the
Stay-at-Home period. However, air quality did not necessarily follow traffic
volumes in every case due to the complexity of interactions between emissions
and meteorology. We also found a strong relationship between lower
socioeconomic status and positive COVID-19 rates. This study provides initial
evidence for social distancing's effectiveness in limiting the spread of
COVID-19, while providing insight into how socioeconomic status has compounded
vulnerability during this crisis. Behavior restrictions disproportionately
benefit whiter and wealthier communities both through protection from spread of
COVID-19 and reduction in air pollution. Such findings may be further
compounded by the impacts of air pollution, which likely exacerbate COVID-19
transmission and mortality rates. Policy makers need to consider adapting
social distancing policies to maximize equity in health protection.

  its implications on airborne disease transmission","To quantify the fate of respiratory droplets under different ambient relative
humidities, direct numerical simulations of a typical respiratory event are
performed. We found that, because small droplets (with initial diameter of
10um) are swept by turbulent eddies in the expelled humid puff, their lifetime
gets extended by a factor of more than 30 times as compared to what is
suggested by the classical picture by William F. Wells, for 50% relative
humidity. With increasing ambient relative humidity the extension of the
lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to around 150
times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than two meters advection range
of the respiratory droplets within one second. Employing Lagrangian statistics,
we demonstrate that the turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small
droplets, leading to many orders of magnitude increase in their lifetimes,
implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory
events than the large ones. Our findings provide the starting points for larger
parameter studies and may be instructive for developing strategies on
optimizing ventilation and indoor humidity control. Such strategies are key in
mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic in the present autumn and upcoming winter.

  classification","Motivation: Recognizing named entities (NER) and their associated attributes
like negation are core tasks in natural language processing. However, manually
labeling data for entity tasks is time consuming and expensive, creating
barriers to using machine learning in new medical applications. Weakly
supervised learning, which automatically builds imperfect training sets from
low cost, less accurate labeling rules, offers a potential solution. Medical
ontologies are compelling sources for generating labels, however combining
multiple ontologies without ground truth data creates challenges due to label
noise introduced by conflicting entity definitions. Key questions remain on the
extent to which weakly supervised entity classification can be automated using
ontologies, or how much additional task-specific rule engineering is required
for state-of-the-art performance. Also unclear is how pre-trained language
models, such as BioBERT, improve the ability to generalize from imperfectly
labeled data.
  Results: We present Trove, a framework for weakly supervised entity
classification using medical ontologies. We report state-of-the-art, weakly
supervised performance on two NER benchmark datasets and establish new
baselines for two entity classification tasks in clinical text. We perform
within an average of 3.5 F1 points (4.2%) of NER classifiers trained with
hand-labeled data. Automatically learning label source accuracies to correct
for label noise provided an average improvement of 3.9 F1 points. BioBERT
provided an average improvement of 0.9 F1 points. We measure the impact of
combining large numbers of ontologies and present a case study on rapidly
building classifiers for COVID-19 clinical tasks. Our framework demonstrates
how a wide range of medical entity classifiers can be quickly constructed using
weak supervision and without requiring manually-labeled training data.

through the study of some cases of interest to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
These include pandemic modeling with mixing between different age groups and
also contact matrices associated with contact between countries. For the final
example we study the effect on mortality of waning from nonspecific vaccines

  Brazil: shifting the high risk from the best to the worst socio-economic
  conditions","Currently, Brazil has one of the fastest increasing COVID-19 epidemics in the
world, that has caused at least 94 thousand confirmed deaths until now. The
city of Sao Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populous in
the country. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is important to
help the urgent need to integrate better actions to face the pandemic. Thus,
this study aimed to analyze the COVID-19 mortality, from March to July 2020,
considering the spatio-time architectures, the socio-economic context of the
population, and using a fine granular level, in the most populous city in
Brazil. For this, we conducted an ecological study, using secondary public data
from the mortality information system. We describe mortality rates for each
epidemiological week and the entire period by sex and age. We modelled the
deaths using spatiotemporal and spatial architectures and Poisson probability
distributions in a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We obtained the
relative risks for temporal and spatiotemporal trends and socio-economic
conditions. To reduce possible sub notification, we considered the confirmed
and suspected deaths. Our findings showed an apparent stabilization of the
temporal trend, at the end of the period, but that may change in the future.
Mortality rate increased with increasing age and was higher in men. The risk of
death was greater in areas with the worst social conditions throughout the
study period. However, this was not a uniform pattern over time, since we
identified a shift from the high risk in the areas with best socio-economic
conditions to the worst ones. Our study contributed by emphasizing the
importance of geographic screening in areas with a higher risk of death, and,
currently, worse socio-economic contexts, as a crucial aspect to reducing
disease mortality and health inequities, through integrated public health
actions.

  radiation exposure -- a reanalysis of older radiobiological data and
  implications for low dose radiotherapy for COVID-19 pneumonia","Currently, there are 14 ongoing clinical studies on low dose radiotherapy
(LDRT) for COVID-19 pneumonia. An underlying assumption is that irradiation of
about 1 Gy is effective at ameliorating viral pneumonia. Its rationale,
however, relies on early human case series or animal studies mostly obtained in
the pre-antibiotic era, where rigorous statistical analyses were not performed.
It therefore remains unclear whether those early data support such assumptions.
With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature
review, we re-analyzed 14 radiobiological animal datasets in which animals
received mostly fractionated doses of radiation before or after bacterial/viral
inoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality, pneumonia
morbidity). In most datasets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. Various
different model systems and types of challenging infection are considered. For
7 studies that evaluated post-inoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to
LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with 2 studies
showing a significant increase (p<0.001) and another showing a significant
decrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. For
pre-inoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with 6 datasets
showing a significant increase (p<0.01) in mortality risk associated with
radiation exposure and the other 2 showing a significant decrease (p<0.05) in
mortality risk. Collectively, these data do not provide clear support for
reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation
exposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction
of effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, one
must be cautious about adducing evidence from the published reports of these
old animal datasets.

  Overlap: Application to COVID-19 and Pneumonia","Trust in predictions made by machine learning models is increased if the

image classification domain, generalization can be assessed through accuracy,

model localizes the object of interest within an image. However, both
generalization and explainability through localization are degraded in
scenarios with significant overlap between classes. We propose a method based
on binary expert networks that enhances the explainability of image
classifications through better localization by mitigating the model uncertainty
induced by class overlap. Our technique performs discriminative localization on
images that contain features with significant class overlap, without explicitly
training for localization. Our method is particularly promising in real-world
class overlap scenarios, such as COVID-19 and pneumonia, where expertly labeled
data for localization is not readily available. This can be useful for early,
rapid, and trustworthy screening for COVID-19.

actions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually
independent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized
equilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of
finding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality
rate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining
and mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that
waning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at

checkers, which have become very popular in the context of COVID-19.
Traditional symptom checkers, however, are based on manually curated expert

changing situation like the one we are facing today. That is why all COVID-19
existing solutions are manual symptom checkers that can only estimate the
probability of this disease and cannot contemplate alternative hypothesis or

the importance and relevance of parameters of the model such as the number of
reported cases, effectiveness of tracking and monitoring policy, and the
transmission rates to contact tracing. We describe the terms ""perfect
tracking"", ""perfect monitoring"" and ""perfect reporting"" to indicate that traced
contacts will be tracked while incubating, tracked contacts are efficiently
monitored so that they do not cause secondary infections, and all infected
persons are reported, respectively. We consider three special scenarios: (1)
perfect monitoring and perfect tracking of contacts of a reported case, (2)
perfect reporting of cases and perfect monitoring of tracked reported cases and
(3) perfect reporting and perfect tracking of contacts of reported cases.
Furthermore, we gave a lower bound on the proportion of contacts to be traced
to ensure that the effective reproduction, ${\mathcal{R}_c}$, is below one and
describe ${\mathcal{R}_c}$ in terms of observable quantities such as the
proportion of reported and traced cases. Model simulations using the COVID-19

through social media during a pandemic and influence community response (i.e.
timing of lockdown, timing of reopening) and disease outbreak indicators (i.e.
number of confirmed cases, number of deaths). The data includes Twitter
interactions from different agencies (2.15K tweets per agency on average) and
crowdsourced data (i.e. Worldometer) on COVID-19 cases and deaths were observed
between February 21, 2020 and June 06, 2020. Several machine learning
techniques such as (i.e. topic mining and sentiment ratings over time) are
applied here to identify the dynamics of emergent topics during this
unprecedented time. Temporal infographics of the results captured the
agency-levels variations over time in circulating information about the
importance of face covering, home quarantine, social distancing and contact
tracing. In addition, agencies showed differences in their discussions about
community transmission, lack of personal protective equipment, testing and
medical supplies, use of tobacco, vaccine, mental health issues,
hospitalization, hurricane season, airports, construction work among others.
Findings could support more efficient transfer of risk and response information
as communities shift to new normal as well as in future pandemics.

framework that leverages iterative feature and algorithm selection to predict
Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining,
and feature and model selection, for predicting the patient-level risk of
hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It
bases this prediction on data from patients' past medical records (before their
COVID-19 infection). MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and
outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning
algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve the
prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large
cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse
outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' pre-COVID health
records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91,
while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU,
hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features
that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each
outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age)
are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the
incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction
model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and
interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve
our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well
as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge.

The practice of social distance attracts attention as a measure to prevent the
spread of infection, but it is difficult for some occupations. Therefore, in
previous studies, the scale of factors that determine social distance has been
developed. However, it was not clear how to select the items among them, and it
seemed to be somewhat arbitrary. In response to this trend, this paper
extracted eight scales by performing exploratory factor analysis based on
certain rules while eliminating arbitrariness as much as possible. They were
Adverse Conditions, Leadership, Information Processing, Response to Aggression,
Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, Communication with the Outside, and Horizontal
Teamwork. Of these, Adverse Conditions, Response to Aggression, and Horizontal
Teamwork had a positive correlation with Physical Proximity, and Information
Processing, Mechanical Movement, Autonomy, and Communication with the Outside
had a negative correlation with Physical Proximity. Furthermore, as a result of
multiple regression analysis, it was shown that Response to Aggression, not the
mere teamwork assumed in previous studies, had the greatest influence on
Physical Proximity.

  the effects of anti-inflammatory intervention","Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that can contribute to the
cytokine storm associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is central to pyroptosis,
which may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be
inhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a
single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3
inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory
intervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is
formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that
describe the dynamics of the biological components involved in pyroptosis. Our
results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation of
the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from
inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell
model is being implemented in a SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator, in collaboration
with a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics of
COVID-19. In this paper, we provide an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 Tissue
Simulator and highlight the effects of pyroptosis on a cellular level.

  pandemic growth","Real-world growth processes, such as epidemic growth, are inherently noisy,
uncertain and often involve multiple growth phases. The logistic-sigmoid
function has been suggested and applied in the domain of modelling such growth
processes. However, existing definitions are limiting, as they do not consider
growth as restricted in two-dimension. Additionally, as the number of growth
phases increase, the modelling and estimation of logistic parameters becomes
more cumbersome, requiring more complex tools and analysis. To remedy this, we
introduce the nlogistic-sigmoid function as a compact, unified modern
definition of logistic growth for modelling such real-world growth phenomena.
Also, we introduce two characteristic metrics of the logistic-sigmoid curve
that can give more robust projections on the state of the growth process in
each dimension. Specifically, we apply this function to modelling the daily
World Health Organization published COVID-19 time-series data of infection and
death cases of the world and countries of the world to date. Our results
demonstrate statistically significant goodness of fit greater than or equal to
99% for affected countries of the world exhibiting patterns of either single or
multiple stages of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, such as the USA.
Consequently, this modern logistic definition and its metrics, as a machine
learning tool, can help to provide clearer and more robust monitoring and
quantification of the ongoing pandemic growth process.

We find that an increase in the Twitter index of social distancing on day t-1

orders, an increase in the number of COVID cases, precipitation and temperature
contribute to reducing human mobility. Republican states are also less likely

  matter","I critique a recent analysis (Miles, Stedman & Heald, 2020) of COVID-19
lockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.
(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit
of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks
from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the
benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000
deaths weekly by mid-September.
  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and
cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut
off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they
assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths
and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes
that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or
social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary
lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under
these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of
serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for
survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in
deaths.
  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without
estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness
costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.

Monte Carlo approach. The analyses include death's data from USA, Brazil,
Mexico, UK, India and Russia, which comprise the four countries with the
highest number of deaths/confirmed cases, as of Aug 07, 2020, according to the
WHO. The Gompertz functions were fitted to the data of weekly averaged
confirmed deaths per day by mapping the $\chi^2$ values. The uncertainties,
variances and covariances of the model parameters were calculated by
propagation. The fitted functions for the average deaths per day for USA and
India have an upward trend, with the former having a higher growth rate and
quite huge uncertainties. For Mexico, UK and Russia, the fits are consistent
with a slope down pattern. For Brazil we found a subtle trend down, but with
significant uncertainties. The USA, UK and India data shown a first peak with a
higher growth rate when compared to the second one, demonstrating the benefits
of non-pharmaceutical interventions of sanitary measures and social distance
flattening the curve. For USA, a third peak seems quite plausible, most likely
related with the recent relaxation policies. Brazil's data are satisfactorily
described by two highly overlapped Gompertz functions with similar growth
rates, suggesting a two-steps process for the pandemic spreading. The 95% CI
for the total number of deaths ($\times 10^3$) predicted by the model for Aug
31, 2020 are 160 to 220, 110 to 130, 59 to 62, 46.6 to 47.3, 54 to 63 and 16.0

estimates for the prevalences of infections are in reasonable agreement with

  calculations based on models of droplet capture","In the COVID--19 pandemic, among the more controversial issues is the use of
masks and face coverings. Much of the concern boils down to the question --
just how effective are face coverings? One means to address this question is to
review our understanding of the physical mechanisms by which masks and
coverings operate -- steric interception, inertial impaction, diffusion and
electrostatic capture. We enquire as to what extent these can be used to
predict the efficacy of coverings. We combine the predictions of the models of
these mechanisms which exist in the filtration literature and compare the
predictions with recent experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations, and find
reasonable agreement with the former and good agreement with the latter.
Building on these results, we explore the parameter space for woven cotton
fabrics to show that three-layered cloth masks can be constructed with
comparable filtration performance to surgical masks under ideal conditions.
Reusable cloth masks thus present an environmentally friendly alternative to
surgical masks so long as the face seal is adequate enough to minimise leakage.

  Multi-granularity Explanatory ML Approach","Millions of people have enrolled and enrol (especially in the Covid-19
pandemic world) in MOOCs. However, the retention rate of learners is
notoriously low. The majority of the research work on this issue focuses on
predicting the dropout rate, but very few use explainable learning patterns as
part of this analysis. However, visual representation of learning patterns
could provide deeper insights into learners' behaviour across different
courses, whilst numerical analyses can -- and arguably, should -- be used to
confirm the latter. Thus, this paper proposes and compares different
granularity visualisations for learning patterns (based on clickstream data)
for both course completers and non-completers. In the large-scale MOOCs we
analysed, across various domains, our fine-grained, fish-eye visualisation
approach showed that non-completers are more likely to jump forward in their
learning sessions, often on a 'catch-up' path, whilst completers exhibit linear
behaviour. For coarser, bird-eye granularity visualisation, we observed
learners' transition between types of learning activity, obtaining typed
transition graphs. The results, backed up by statistical significance analysis
and machine learning, provide insights for course instructors to maintain
engagement of learners by adapting the course design to not just 'dry'
predicted values, but explainable, visually viable paths extracted.

recently, the problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach to

of relying on a few experts, a crowd of (non-expert) judges is exploited. We
follow the same approach to study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and
reliable method to assess statements truthfulness during a pandemic. We
specifically target statements related to the COVID-19 health emergency, that
is still ongoing at the time of the study and has arguably caused an increase

  by evolutionary game dynamics","During pandemic events, strategies such as social distancing can be
fundamental to curb viral spreading. Such actions can reduce the number of
simultaneous infections and mitigate the disease spreading, which is relevant
to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be
suggested, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception
of the disease risk. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that
some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated, avoiding
unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological SIR
model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic
individual quarantine strategies, intending to combine in a single process
social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. The disease
spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a
lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual
and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The
game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs
the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the
agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of
infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in
previous epidemic scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is
found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak,
while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low
awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease
risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model
spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the
fundamental role of social strategies.

a global scale. Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we
address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that
Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to
Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits
attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98
$\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59
$\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16
$\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD).
Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF
calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free
energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears
to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen
bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the
anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may
further reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by
the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

multivariate discrete-time Markov model to analyze the propagation of COVID-19

effect of mobility restriction policies on the spread of the disease. We use
data on daily human mobility across regions and apply the Bayesian framework to
estimate the proposed model. The results show that the spread of the disease in
China was predominately driven by community transmission within regions and the
lockdown policy introduced by local governments curbed the spread of the
pandemic. Further, we document that Hubei was only the epicenter of the early
epidemic stage. Secondary epicenters, such as Beijing and Guangdong, had
already become established by late January 2020, and the disease spread out to
connected regions. The transmission from these epicenters substantially
declined following the introduction of human mobility restrictions across
regions.

  Science-Based Social Distance Guidelines","COVID-19 pandemic has strikingly demonstrated how important it is to develop
fundamental knowledge related to generation, transport and inhalation of
pathogen-laden droplets and their subsequent possible fate as airborne
particles, or aerosols, in the context of human to human transmission. It is
also increasingly clear that airborne transmission is an important contributor
to rapid spreading of the disease. In this paper, we discuss the processes of
droplet generation by exhalation, their potential transformation into airborne
particles by evaporation, transport over long distances by the exhaled puff and
by ambient air turbulence, and final inhalation by the receiving host as
interconnected multiphase flow processes. A simple model for the time evolution
of droplet/aerosol concentration is presented based on a theoretical analysis
of the relevant physical processes. The modeling framework along with detailed
experiments and simulations can be used to study a wide variety of scenarios
involving breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing and in a number of
environmental conditions, as humid or dry atmosphere, confined or open
environment. Although a number of questions remain open on the physics of
evaporation and coupling with persistence of the virus, it is clear that with a
more reliable understanding of the underlying flow physics of virus
transmission one can set the foundation for an improved methodology in
designing case-specific social distancing and infection control guidelines.

and effective response. Because infection may be spread by people who are
pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely
to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. Thus, when outbreaks occur there
is a need to anticipate which populations and locations are at heightened risk
of exposure. In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility
data for estimating the geographic distribution of transmission risk. We
present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments
from near-real-time population mobility data. We validate our estimates against
three well-documented COVID-19 outbreak scenarios in Australia. Two of these
were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission
scenario. Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of
geographic patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in
scenarios involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual
travel patterns. For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate
that mobility data adds the most value to risk predictions when case counts are
low and spatially clustered. Our method could assist health systems in the
allocation of testing resources, and potentially guide the implementation of
geographically-targeted restrictions on movement and social interaction.

derived from a superior modality (CT) serving as ground truth, projected onto
digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) to: 1) train a convolutional neural
network to quantify airspace disease on paired CXRs; and 2) compare the
DRR-trained CNN to expert human readers in the CXR evaluation of patients with

  Materials and Methods: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19
patients (with positive RT-PCR), from March-May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in
the northeastern USA, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hrs. The ground
truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19 related AD (POv) was established by
manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3D masks were projected into 2D
anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to compute
area-based AD percentage (POa). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was
trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 patients, automatically segmenting lungs, AD and quantifying
POa on CXR. CNN POa results were compared to POa quantified on CXR by two
expert readers and to the POv ground-truth, by computing correlations and mean
absolute errors.
  Results: Bootstrap mean absolute error (MAE) and correlations between POa and
POv were 11.98% [11.05%-12.47%] and 0.77 [0.70-0.82] for average of expert
readers, and 9.56%-9.78% [8.83%-10.22%] and 0.78-0.81 [0.73-0.85] for the CNN,
respectively.
  Conclusion: Our CNN trained with DRR using CT-derived airspace quantification
achieved expert radiologist level of accuracy in the quantification of airspace
disease on CXR, in patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19.

  Infection of COVID-19 in India","Epidemiological models are the mathematical models that capture the dynamics
of epidemics. The spread of the virus has two routes - exogenous and
endogenous. The exogenous spread is from outside the population under study,
and endogenous spread is within the population under study. Although some of
the models consider the exogenous source of infection, they have not studied
the interplay between exogenous and endogenous spreads. In this paper, we
introduce a novel model - the Exo-SIR model that captures both the exogenous
and endogenous spread of the virus. We analyze to find out the relationship
between endogenous and exogenous infections during the Covid19 pandemic. First,
we simulate the Exo-SIR model without assuming any contact network for the
population. Second, simulate it by assuming that the contact network is a scale
free network. Third, we implemented the Exo-SIR model on a real dataset
regarding Covid19. We found that endogenous infection is influenced by even a
minimal rate of exogenous infection. Also, we found that in the presence of
exogenous infection, the endogenous infection peak becomes higher, and the peak
occurs earlier. This means that if we consider our response to a pandemic like
Covid19, we should be prepared for an earlier and higher number of cases than
the SIR model suggests if there are the exogenous source(s) of infection.

of sustained reductions in CO$_2$ emissions. We use Gaussian process (GP)
regression to assess whether CO$_2$ emissions reductions would have occurred

due to factors unrelated to the pandemic. We show that CO$_2$ emissions are
lower than levels expected in the absence of COVID-19 for each month from March

significant considering hypothesis tests at 5% significance levels. To make
predictions about whether COVID-19-related CO$_2$ emissions reductions will be
sustained in the power sector, we assess the relative impacts of the pandemic
on electricity generation (E) and on the carbon intensity of electricity supply
(C/E). E is on average 2.9\% lower than what we would expect in the absence of
COVID-19 from March through July 2020. We expect E to rebound alongside a
recovery of the U.S. economy. C/E is determined to be 2.7% lower on average
than what we would expect in the absence of COVID-19 from March through July
2020. Reductions in C/E are mostly attributable to reductions in the share of
coal-fired electricity generation. We analyze the expected profitability
through 2021 of the 845 coal-fired power plant units operating in the U.S. We
find that only 76 of those units, representing 1.3% of total coal generation
capacity, were expected to be profitable prior to COVID-19 but are no longer
expected to be profitable. We conclude that COVID-19 is unlikely to have a

technologies enables scientists and technologists to address an impressively
broad range of biomedical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic challenges. This
wide-reaching scientific capacity, however, also raises a diverse array of
ethical challenges. The need for researchers to act quickly and globally in
tackling SARS-CoV-2 demands unprecedented practices of open research and
responsible data sharing at a time when innovation ecosystems are hobbled by
proprietary protectionism, inequality, and a lack of public trust. Moreover,
societally impactful interventions like digital contact tracing are raising
fears of surveillance creep and are challenging widely held commitments to
privacy, autonomy, and civil liberties. Prepandemic concerns that data-driven
innovations may function to reinforce entrenched dynamics of societal inequity
have likewise intensified given the disparate impact of the virus on vulnerable
social groups and the life-and-death consequences of biased and discriminatory
public health outcomes. To address these concerns, I offer five steps that need
to be taken to encourage responsible research and innovation. These provide a
practice-based path to responsible AI/ML design and discovery centered on open,
accountable, equitable, and democratically governed processes and products.
When taken from the start, these steps will not only enhance the capacity of
innovators to tackle COVID-19 responsibly, they will, more broadly, help to

in the press, social media, and scientific literature describing 203 instances
of actual use of 104 different models of ground and aerial robots for the
COVID19 response. The reports are organized by stakeholders and work domain
into a novel taxonomy of six application categories, reflecting major
differences in work envelope, adoption strategy, and human-robot interaction
constraints. Each application category is further divided into a total of 30
subcategories based on differences in mission. The largest number of reported
instances were for public safety (74 out of 203) and clinical care (46), though
robots for quality of life (27), continuity of work and education (22),
laboratory and supply chain automation (21), and non-clinical care (13) were
notable. Ground robots were used more frequently (119) than aerial systems
(84), but unlike ground robots, aerial applications appeared to take advantage
of existing general purpose platforms that were used for multiple applications
and missions. Of the 104 models of robots, 82 were determined to be
commercially available or already existed as a prototype, 11 were modifications
to existing robots, 11 were built from scratch. Teleoperation dominated the
control style (105 instances), with the majority of those applications
intentionally providing remote presence and thus not amenable to full autonomy
in the future. Automation accounted for 74 instances and taskable agency forms
of autonomy, 24. The data suggests areas for further research in autonomy,
human-robot interaction, and adaptability.

  Analysis and Implications","Most work to date on mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is focused urgently on
biomedicine and epidemiology. Yet, pandemic-related policy decisions cannot be
made on health information alone. Decisions need to consider the broader
impacts on people and their needs. Quantifying human needs across the
population is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high
coverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and
other external effects. Here, we propose a computational methodology, building
on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can capture a holistic view of relative
changes in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences
approach that corrects for seasonality and volume variations. We apply this
approach to characterize changes in human needs across physiological,
socioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35
billion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14
months. The analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has
increased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the
pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and
variations in statewide policies, we find that the durations of
shelter-in-place mandates have influenced social and emotional needs
significantly. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical
needs, such as support for unemployment and domestic violence, can be
identified through web search interactions. Our approach and results suggest
that population-scale monitoring of shifts in human needs can inform policies
and recovery efforts for current and anticipated needs.

mathematical models to evaluate strategies to suppress the spread of the virus
on campus, specifically in dorms and in classrooms. For dorms, we show that
giving students single rooms rather than double rooms can substantially reduce
virus spread. For classrooms, we show that moving classes with size above some
cutoff online can make the basic reproduction number $R_0<1$, preventing a wide
spread epidemic. The cutoff will depend on the contagiousness of the disease in

contact tracing app using an
  agent-based model","A contact-tracing strategy has been deemed necessary to contain the spread of
COVID-19 following the relaxation of lockdown measures. Using an agent-based
model, we explore one of the technology-based strategies proposed, a
contact-tracing smartphone app. The model simulates the spread of COVID-19 in a
population of agents on an urban scale. Agents are heterogeneous in their
characteristics and are linked in a multi-layered network representing the
social structure - including households, friendships, employment and schools.
We explore the interplay of various adoption rates of the contact-tracing app,
different levels of testing capacity, and behavioural factors to assess the
impact on the epidemic. Results suggest that a contact tracing app can
contribute substantially to reducing infection rates in the population when
accompanied by a sufficient testing capacity or when the testing policy
prioritises symptomatic cases. As user rate increases, prevalence of infection
decreases. With that, when symptomatic cases are not prioritised for testing, a
high rate of app users can generate an extensive increase in the demand for
testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app
counterproductive. This points to the crucial role of an efficient testing
policy and the necessity to upscale testing capacity.

  COVID-19 Projects","The ability to determine what parts of objects and surfaces people touch as
they go about their daily lives would be useful in understanding how the
COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person has touched an object or
surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer
vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the
2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this
solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to
projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to
infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require
significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint
variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a
person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to
this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact
between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the
object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing
their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected
points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency.
Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep
networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface
space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography
transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life
applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy
detection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in
a meeting room using the contact information.

  regions and provinces: an analysis of environmental, demographic, and

emergency, through the adoption of quick and increasingly stringent measures to
contain the outbreak. Despite this, Italy has suffered a huge human and social
cost, especially in Lombardy. The aim of this paper is dual: i) first, to
investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across
Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression
approach; and ii) second, to build a taxonomy of provinces with similar
mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward hierarchical agglomerative
clustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution,
climatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that
represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health
care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce
the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density,
level of air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity,
COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were
positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical
integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular,
the risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a
three-fold greater risk than the 80 to 89 years old and four-fold greater risk
than 70 to 79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest
mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest
risk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and
health system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining
the CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by
the massive stress of the Italian health system.

curtailed to a larger or lesser extent through measures of social distancing
imposed by most countries. In this work, we link directly, through machine
learning techniques, infection data at a country level to a single number that
signifies social distancing effectiveness. We assume that the standard SIR
model gives a reasonable description of the dynamics of spreading, and thus the
social distancing aspect can be modeled through time-dependent infection rates
that are imposed externally. We use an exponential ansatz to analyze the SIR
model, find an exact solution for the time-independent infection rate, and
derive a simple first-order differential equation for the time-dependent
infection rate as a function of the infected population. Using infected number
data from the ""first wave"" of the infection from eight countries, and through
physics-informed machine learning, we extract the degree of linear dependence
in social distancing that led to the specific infections. We find that in the
two extremes are Greece, with the highest decay slope on one side, and the US
on the other with a practically flat ""decay"". The hierarchy of slopes is
compatible with the effectiveness of the pandemic containment in each country.
Finally, we train our network with data after the end of the analyzed period,

appear to be very close to the actual infection values.

propagated throughout the world. The application of deep learning for image
classification of chest X-ray images of Covid-19 patients, could become a novel
pre-diagnostic detection methodology. However, deep learning architectures
require large labelled datasets. This is often a limitation when the subject of
research is relatively new as in the case of the virus outbreak, where dealing
with small labelled datasets is a challenge. Moreover, in the context of a new
highly infectious disease, the datasets are also highly imbalanced,with few
observations from positive cases of the new disease. In this work we evaluate
the performance of the semi-supervised deep learning architecture known as
MixMatch using a very limited number of labelled observations and highly
imbalanced labelled dataset. We propose a simple approach for correcting data
imbalance, re-weight each observationin the loss function, giving a higher
weight to the observationscorresponding to the under-represented class. For
unlabelled observations, we propose the usage of the pseudo and augmentedlabels
calculated by MixMatch to choose the appropriate weight. The MixMatch method
combined with the proposed pseudo-label based balance correction improved
classification accuracy by up to 10%, with respect to the non balanced MixMatch
algorithm, with statistical significance. We tested our proposed approach with

Doctors with a smartphone can leverage the application to save the considerable

approach by the use of Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN)

making it completely reliable for its users. On top of that a semi-live

enabled a world leading outcome in both in health and economic terms. The
lessons from this experience are widely applicable, shareable both as
supporting service to other regions and through knowledge transfer.

  Tracing","Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many governments suspended outdoor
activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had severe impact on the economy and
peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective
contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models
suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact
tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital
contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple
Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to
supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn
scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt
to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many
digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit
the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this
paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks,
specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving
digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers
to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we
showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks
on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our example DoS attacks
showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within
normal working hours and days.

activity over public health. Pro-social and economic restriction discourse less
frequently mentions rights and freedoms, instead supporting restrictions as
following state and medical advice and out of deference and respect to medical
professionals. Discourse is highly polarised and divisive and articulated
largely through established political identity positions. It is suggested that
more attention is paid to discussions of balancing rights and freedoms in COVID
control restrictions. To convince opposers of restrictions, supporters of
restrictions should base arguments around communal rights and positive
freedoms. It is also important to critically evaluate whether and how these
perspectives need to be adapted to be appropriate and resonant in democratic

cooperate using emergent symbolic language to solve the task of semantic

information from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a
symbolic sentence sampled from a categorical distribution of vocabularies. The
Receiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates the segmentation mask. A
private emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel
used to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment
existing state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic
generator to form symbolic segmentation models. Our symbolic segmentation
framework achieves state of the art performance for segmentation of lung

  recursive contact tracing","The challenges presented by the COVID-19 epidemic have created a renewed
interest in the development of new methods to combat infectious diseases. A
prominent property of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is the significant fraction
of asymptomatic transmission. This may influence the effectiveness of the
standard contact tracing procedure for quarantining potentially infected
individuals. However, the effects of asymptomatic transmission on the epidemic
threshold of epidemic spreading on networks are largely unknown. Here we study
the critical percolation transition in a simple epidemic network model in the
presence of a recursive contact tracing algorithm for instant quarantining. We
find that, above a certain fraction of asymptomatic transmission, standard
contact tracing loses its ability to suppress spreading below the epidemic
threshold. However, we also find that recursive contact tracing opens a
possibility to contain epidemics with a large fraction of asymptomatic or
presymptomatic transmission. In particular, we calculate the required fraction
of network nodes participating in the contact tracing for networks with
arbitrary degree distributions and for varying recursion depths and discuss the
influence of recursion depth and asymptomatic rate on the epidemic percolation
phase transition. We test and illustrate our theoretical results using
numerical simulations on infection trees and networks. We anticipate recursive
contact tracing to provide a basis for digital, app-based contact tracing tools
that extend the efficiency of contact tracing to diseases with a large fraction

differential equations. Several basic parameters are involved in the model:
coefficients of infection rate, incubation rate, recovery rate. The
coefficients are adaptable to each specific infection, for each individual
country, and depend on the measures to limit the spread of the infection and
the effectiveness of the methods of treatment of the infected people in the
respective country. If such coefficients are known, solving the nonlinear
system is possible to be able to make some hypotheses for the development of
the epidemic. This is the reason for using Bulgarian COVID-19 data to first of
all, solve the so-called ""inverse problem"" and to find the parameters of the

of the model as a function of time, followed by computer solution of the

and finding (and as a consequence applying mass-scale measures, e.g.,
distancing, disinfection, limitation of public events), a suitable scenario for
the change in the proportion of the numbers of the four studied groups in the

extensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased

spread, many of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as

It is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing masks

manifestations ranging from mild febrile illness and cough up to acute
respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Data from

correlate with severity of disease and lethality. Significantly elevated
cytokine levels, i.e. cytokine storm, seem to play a central role in severity
and lethality in COVID-19. We have previously shown that excessive cytokine
release induced by highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza A virus was reduced
by application of proteasome inhibitors. In the present study we present
experimental data of a central cellular pro-inflammatory signal pathways,
NF-kappaB, in the context of published clinical data from COVID-19 patients and
develop a hypothesis for a therapeutic approach aiming at the simultaneous
inhibition of whole cascades of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines via
blocking the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB by proteasome inhibitors. The
simultaneous inhibition of multiple cytokines/chemokines using clinically
approved proteasome inhibitors is expected to have a higher therapeutic
potential compared to single target approaches to prevent cascade (i.e.
triggering, synergistic, and redundant) effects of multiple induced cytokines
and may provide an additional therapeutic option to be explored for treatment
of critical stage COVID-19 patients.

(NO$_{x}$) emission contributed to O$_{3}$ increases in populated regions,
whereas the reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOC) contributed to
O$_{3}$ decreases across the country. Due to a decreasing level of NO$_{x}$
saturation from north to south, the emission reduction in NO$_{x}$ (46%) and
VOC (32%) contributed to net O$_{3}$ increases in north China; the opposite
effects of NO$_{x}$ decrease (49%) and VOC decrease (24%) balanced out in
central China, whereas the comparable decreases (45-55%) in the two precursors
contributed to net O$_{3}$ declines in south China. Our study highlights the
complex dependence of O$_{3}$ on its precursors and the importance of
meteorology in the short-term O$_{3}$ variability.

  Traffic","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments imposed lock downs that forced
hundreds of millions of citizens to stay at home. The implementation of
confinement measures increased Internet traffic demands of residential users,
in particular, for remote working, entertainment, commerce, and education,
which, as a result, caused traffic shifts in the Internet core. In this paper,
using data from a diverse set of vantage points (one ISP, three IXPs, and one
metropolitan educational network), we examine the effect of these lockdowns on
traffic shifts. We find that the traffic volume increased by 15-20% almost
within a week--while overall still modest, this constitutes a large increase
within this short time period. However, despite this surge, we observe that the
Internet infrastructure is able to handle the new volume, as most traffic
shifts occur outside of traditional peak hours. When looking directly at the
traffic sources, it turns out that, while hypergiants still contribute a
significant fraction of traffic, we see (1) a higher increase in traffic of
non-hypergiants, and (2) traffic increases in applications that people use when
at home, such as Web conferencing, VPN, and gaming. While many networks see
increased traffic demands, in particular, those providing services to
residential users, academic networks experience major overall decreases. Yet,
in these networks, we can observe substantial increases when considering
applications associated to remote working and lecturing.

important part of our lives. People are encouraged to cover their faces when in

raised a serious question on the accuracy of the facial recognition system used
for tracking school/office attendance and to unlock phones. Many organizations
use facial recognition as a means of authentication and have already developed
the necessary datasets in-house to be able to deploy such a system.
Unfortunately, masked faces make it difficult to be detected and recognized,
thereby threatening to make the in-house datasets invalid and making such
facial recognition systems inoperable. This paper addresses a methodology to
use the current facial datasets by augmenting it with tools that enable masked
faces to be recognized with low false-positive rates and high overall accuracy,
without requiring the user dataset to be recreated by taking new pictures for

effectively creating a large dataset of masked faces. The dataset generated
with this tool is then used towards training an effective facial recognition
system with target accuracy for masked faces. We report an increase of 38% in
the true positive rate for the Facenet system. We also test the accuracy of

from malicious accounts towards manipulating public opinion, have become
increasingly prevalent. There has been growing evidence of social media abuse
towards influencing politics and social issues in other countries, raising
numerous concerns. The identification and prevention of coordinated campaigns
has become critical to tackling disinformation at its source. Existing
approaches to detect malicious campaigns make strict assumptions about
coordinated behaviours, such as malicious accounts perform synchronized actions
or share features assumed to be indicative of coordination. Others require part
of the malicious accounts in the campaign to be revealed in order to detect the
rest. Such assumptions significantly limit the effectiveness of existing
approaches. In contrast, we propose AMDN (Attentive Mixture Density Network) to
automatically uncover coordinated group behaviours from account activities and
interactions between accounts, based on temporal point processes. Furthermore,
we leverage the learned model to understand and explain the behaviours of
coordinated accounts in disinformation campaigns. We find that the average
influence between coordinated accounts is the highest, whereas these accounts
are not much influenced by regular accounts. We evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method on Twitter data related to Russian interference in US
Elections. Additionally, we identify disinformation campaigns in COVID-19 data

segmentation on CXRs from digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). DRR4Covid
comprises of an infection-aware DRR generator, a classification and/or
segmentation network, and a domain adaptation module. The infection-aware DRR
generator is able to produce DRRs with adjustable strength of radiological
signs of COVID-19 infection, and generate pixel-level infection annotations
that match the DRRs precisely. The domain adaptation module is introduced to
reduce the domain discrepancy between DRRs and CXRs by training networks on
unlabeled real CXRs and labeled DRRs together.We provide a simple but effective
implementation of DRR4Covid by using a domain adaptation module based on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and a FCN-based network with a classification
header and a segmentation header. Extensive experiment results have confirmed
the efficacy of our method; specifically, quantifying the performance by
accuracy, AUC and F1-score, our network without using any annotations from CXRs
has achieved a classification score of (0.954, 0.989, 0.953) and a segmentation
score of (0.957, 0.981, 0.956) on a test set with 794 normal cases and 794
positive cases. Besides, we estimate the sensitive of X-ray images in detecting
COVID-19 infection by adjusting the strength of radiological signs of COVID-19

observed mobility changes to socioeconomic conditions, estimating a gravity
model to assess the effect of socioeconomic conditions on mobility flows. We
observe an overall reduction in mobility trends, but the overall connectivity
between different areas of the city remains after the lockdown, reflecting the
mobility network's resilience. We find that the responses to lockdown policies
depend on socioeconomic conditions. Before the pandemic, the population with
better socioeconomic conditions shows higher mobility flows. Since the
lockdown, mobility presents a general decrease, but the population with worse
socioeconomic conditions shows lower decreases in mobility flows. We conclude
deriving policy implications.

  SARS CoV 2 spike and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2","A recent experimental study found that the binding affinity between the
cellular receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike (S) protein of novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is more than 10-fold higher
than that of the original severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV). However, main-chain structures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD are almost the
same with that of the SARS-CoV RBD. Understanding physical mechanism
responsible for the outstanding affinity between the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 is
the ""urgent challenge"" for developing blockers, vaccines and therapeutic
antibodies against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
Considering the mechanisms of hydrophobic interaction, hydration shell, surface
tension, and the shielding effect of water molecules, this study reveals a
hydrophobic-interaction-based mechanism by means of which SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2
bind together in an aqueous environment. The hydrophobic interaction between
the SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2 protein is found to be significantly greater than
that between SARS-CoV S and ACE2. At the docking site, the hydrophobic portions
of the hydrophilic side chains of SARS-CoV-2 S are found to be involved in the
hydrophobic interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. We propose a method to
design live attenuated viruses by mutating several key amino acid residues of
the spike protein to decrease the hydrophobic surface areas at the docking
site. Mutation of a small amount of residues can greatly reduce the hydrophobic
binding of the coronavirus to the receptor, which may be significant reduce
infectivity and transmissibility of the virus.

matters worse, traditional observational methods such as in-person reporting is

activities through network cameras; this approach is scalable and observers can
stay in safe locations. This research team has created methods that can
discover thousands of network cameras worldwide, retrieve data from the
cameras, analyze the data, and report the sizes of crowds as different
countries issued and lifted restrictions (also called ''lockdown''). We
discover 11,140 network cameras that provide real-time data and we present the
results across 15 countries. We collect data from these cameras beginning April
2020 at approximately 0.5TB per week. After analyzing 10,424,459 images from

reveals that the residents in some countries exhibited more activity (judged by
numbers of people and vehicles) after the restrictions were lifted. In other
countries, the amounts of activities showed no obvious changes during the
restrictions and after the restrictions were lifted. The data further reveals
whether people stay ''social distancing'', at least 6 feet apart. This study
discerns whether social distancing is being followed in several types of
locations and geographical locations worldwide and serve as an early indicator

techniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data

Statistics. Having matched and analysed both sources, we address both the

Counter-intuitively, the number of journalism job ads in Australia rose from

period studied the figures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large
and erratic fluctuations. The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has
significantly worsened the crisis. We can also tease out more granular
findings, including: that there are now more women than men journalists in
Australia, but that gender inequity is worsening, with women journalists
getting younger and worse-paid just as men journalists are, on average, getting
older and better-paid; that, despite the crisis besetting the industry, the
demand for journalism skills has increased; and that the skills sought by
journalism job ads increasingly include social media and generalist
communications.

to fail because of the contagion time before onset, mild cases and/or

a scheme for containing an outbreak in a city that consists in adding an extra
firewall block between the outbreak and the rest of the city. We implement a
coupled compartment model with stochastic noise to simulate a localized
outbreak that is partially isolated and analyze its evolution with and without
firewall for different plausible model parameters. We explore how further
improvements could be achieved if the epidemic evolution would trigger policy
changes for the flux and/or lock-down in the different blocks. Our results show
that a substantial improvement is obtained by merely adding an extra block
between the outbreak and the bulk of the city.

  Comorbidities and Symptoms that Increased Risk of Mortality in COVID-19","Background: Providing appropriate care for people suffering from COVID-19,
the disease caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus is a significant global
challenge. Many individuals who become infected have pre-existing conditions
that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity and mortality
risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative about
individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Accurately determining how
comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus
greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision.
  Methods: To assess the interaction of patient comorbidities with COVID-19
severity and mortality we performed a meta-analysis of the published global
literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated
COVID-19 global dataset.
  Results: Our meta-analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2
diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with
COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning
classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD,
CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the
most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who
survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictor of
mortality, in terms of symptom-comorbidity combinations, it was observed that
Pneumonia-Hypertension, Pneumonia-Diabetes and Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS)-Hypertension showed the most significant effects on COVID-19
mortality.
  Conclusions: These results highlight patient cohorts most at risk of COVID-19
related severe morbidity and mortality which have implications for
prioritization of hospital resources.

has been quite unstable. We have predicted that in the case that a fraction of
the population above a certain threshold returns to the public space, the
negative tendency of the epidemic curve will revert. Such predictions were
based on modeling the reactivation of economic activity after lockdown by means
of an epidemiological model on a contact network of Mexico City derived from
mobile device co-localization. We evaluated the epidemic dynamics considering
the tally of active and recovered cases documented in the mexican government's
open database. Scenarios were modeled in which different percentages of the
population are reintegrated to the public space by scanning values ranging from
5% up to 50%. Null models were built by using data from the Jornada Nacional de
Sana Distancia (the Mexican model of elective lockdown) in which there was a
mobility reduction of 75% and no mandatory mobility restrictions. We found that
a new peak of cases in the epidemic curve was very likely for scenarios in
which more than 5% of the population rejoined the public space; The return of
more than 50% of the population synchronously will unleash a peak of a
magnitude similar to the one that was predicted with no mitigation strategies.
By evaluating the tendencies of the epidemic dynamics, the number of new cases
registered, new cases hospitalized, and new deaths, we consider that under this
scenario, reactivation following only elective measures may not be optimal.
Given the need to reactivate economic activities, we suggest to consider
alternative measures that allow to diminish the contacts among people returning
to the public space. We evaluated that by ""encapsulating"" reactivated workers

  evolutionary pattern of amino acid residues","Spike (S) glycoproteins mediate the coronavirus entry into the host cell. The
S1 subunit of S-proteins contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is
able to recognize different host receptors, highlighting its remarkable
capacity to adapt to their hosts along the viral evolution. While RBD in spike
proteins is determinant for the virus-receptor interaction, the active residues
lie at the receptor-binding motif (RBM), a region located in RBD that plays a
fundamental role binding the outer surface of their receptors. Here, we address
the hypothesis that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains able to use
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins have adapted their RBM along
the viral evolution to explore specific conformational topology driven by the
residues YGF to infect host cells. We also speculate that this YGF-based
mechanism can act as a protein signature located at the RBM to distinguish
coronaviruses able to use ACE2 as a cell entry receptor.

  the structural inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease","COVID-19 presents a great threat to public health worldwide and the
infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 is currently the target of much research aiming at
inhibition. The virus' main protease is a dimeric enzyme that has only recently
begun to be thoroughly described, opening the door for virtual screening more
broadly. Here, a PAIN-filtered flavonoid database was screened against four
sites of the protease: a free (normal) conformation of the Substrate Binding
Site (NSBS), an induced-fit state of the SBS (ISBS), a Dimerization Site (DS)
and a Cryptic Site (CS). The mean binding energies of the top five ligands from
each site were -9.52, -11.512, -7.042 and -10.348 kcal/mol for the NSBS, the
ISBS, the DS and the CS, respectively. For the DS and CS, these top five
compounds were selected as candidates to bind their respective site. In the
case of SBS, the top 30 ligands with the lowest binding energies from NSBS and
ISBS were contrasted and the ones present in both lists were selected as the
final candidates. The final list was: Dorsilurin E (FL3FQUNP0001), Euchrenone
a11 (FL2FALNP0014), Kurziflavolactone C (FL2FA9NC0016), Licorice glycoside E
(FL2F1AGSN001) and Taxifolin 3'- (6""-phenyl- acetylglucoside) (FL4DACGS0020)

only a fraction of what is possible on the web. To reach the full potential of
an assistant, it is desirable that individuals can create skills to automate
their personal web browsing routines. Many seemingly simple routines, however,
such as monitoring COVID-19 stats for their hometown, detecting changes in
their child's grades online, or sending personally-addressed messages to a
group, cannot be automated without conventional programming concepts such as
conditional and iterative evaluation. This paper presents VASH (Voice Assistant
Scripting Helper), a new system that empowers users to create useful web-based
virtual assistant skills without learning a formal programming language. With
VASH, the user demonstrates their task of interest in the browser and issues a
few voice commands, such as naming the skills and adding conditions on the
action. VASH turns these multi-modal specifications into skills that can be
invoked invoice on a virtual assistant. These skills are represented in a
formal programming language we designed called WebTalk, which supports
parameterization, function invocation, conditionals, and iterative execution.
VASH is a fully working prototype that works on the Chrome browser on
real-world websites. Our user study shows that users have many web routines
they wish to automate, 81% of which can be expressed using VASH. We found that

  User Questions to COVID-19 FAQs","People increasingly search online for answers to their medical questions but
the rate at which medical questions are asked online significantly exceeds the
capacity of qualified people to answer them. This leaves many questions
unanswered or inadequately answered. Many of these questions are not unique,
and reliable identification of similar questions would enable more efficient

problem. Almost every government agency and healthcare organization has tried
to meet the informational need of users by building online FAQs, but there is
no way for people to ask their question and know if it is answered on one of

question similarity, these approaches do not generalize well to domains that
require expert knowledge to determine semantic similarity, such as the medical
domain. In this paper, we show how a double fine-tuning approach of pretraining
a neural network on medical question-answer pairs followed by fine-tuning on
medical question-question pairs is a particularly useful intermediate task for
the ultimate goal of determining medical question similarity. While other
pretraining tasks yield an accuracy below 78.7% on this task, our model
achieves an accuracy of 82.6% with the same number of training examples, an
accuracy of 80.0% with a much smaller training set, and an accuracy of 84.5%

recommendation systems, robot assistants are envisioned to become more present
in the hospitality industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also
highlighted the need to have more service robots in our everyday lives, to
minimise the risk of human to-human transmission. One such example would be
coffee shops, which have become intrinsic to our everyday lives. However,
serving an excellent cup of coffee is not a trivial feat as a coffee blend
typically comprises rich aromas, indulgent and unique flavours and a lingering
aftertaste. Our work addresses this by proposing a computational model which
recommends optimal coffee beans resulting from the user's preferences.
Specifically, given a set of coffee bean properties (objective features), we
apply different supervised learning techniques to predict coffee qualities
(subjective features). We then consider an unsupervised learning method to
analyse the relationship between coffee beans in the subjective feature space.
Evaluated on a real coffee beans dataset based on digitised reviews, our
results illustrate that the proposed computational model gives up to 92.7
percent recommendation accuracy for coffee beans prediction. From this, we
propose how this computational model can be deployed on a service robot to
reliably predict customers' coffee bean preferences, starting from the user
inputting their coffee preferences to the robot recommending the coffee beans
that best meet the user's likings.

  SARS-Cov-2 main protease (Mpro) as potential COVID-19 therapies","There remains an urgent need to identify existing drugs that might be
suitable for treating patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. Drugs rarely
act at a single molecular target, with off target effects often being
responsible for undesirable side effects and sometimes, beneficial synergy
between targets for a specific illness. Off target activities have also led to
blockbuster drugs in some cases, e.g. Viagra for erectile dysfunction and
Minoxidil for male pattern hair loss. Drugs already in use or in clinical
trials plus approved natural products constitute a rich resource for discovery
of therapeutic agents that can be repurposed for existing and new conditions,
based on the rationale that they have already been assessed for safety in man.
A key question then is how to rapidly and efficiently screen such compounds for
activity against new pandemic pathogens such as COVID-19. Here we show how a
fast and robust computational process can be used to screen large libraries of
drugs and natural compounds to identify those that may inhibit the main
protease of SARS-Cov-2 (3CL pro, Mpro). We show how the resulting shortlist of
candidates with strongest binding affinities is highly enriched in compounds
that have been independently identified as potential antivirals against
COVID-19. The top candidates also include a substantial number of drugs and
natural products not previously identified as having potential COVID-19
activity, thereby providing additional targets for experimental validation.
This in silico screening pipeline may also be useful for repurposing of
existing drugs and discovery of new drug candidates against other medically
important pathogens and for use in future pandemics.

proportion has been well studied in the literature owing to its wide range of
applications. In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also
known as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays
an important role in various fields including clinical studies and random
sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers
from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been
developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the
optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance
comparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by
developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of
shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas
for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation
studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or
as well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings. Finally, to
illustrate the usefulness of our new method, we also revisit a recent
meta-analysis on COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical
distancing on the infection of coronavirus, in which six out of seven studies
encounter the zero-event problem.

Social distancing is of paramount importance to limit the spread of the

understood. Here, we demonstrate that available knowledge is largely inadequate
to make predictions on the reach of infectious droplets emitted during a cough

thousands of respiratory droplets by massive state-of-the-art numerical
simulations of the airflow caused by a typical cough. We find that different
initial distributions of droplet size taken from literature and different
ambient relative humidity lead to opposite conclusions: (1) most vs none of the
viral content settles in the first 1-2 m; (2) viruses are carried entirely on
dry nuclei vs on liquid droplets; (3) small droplets travel less than 2.5m vs
more than 7.5m. We point to two key issues that need to be addressed urgently

are the unavailability of recommended efficacious drugs or vaccines along with
the human to human transmission nature of SARS-CoV-2 virus. So, there is urgent
need to search appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs.
In this communication, molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviral
drugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with the
three therapeutic target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease
(PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking results
of both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigational
drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drug
BXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock score
revealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of RdRp than
BXM. The computational molecular docking revealed that the drug BXA may be more
effective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.

complex combination of circumstance, study design, data, statistics, and
analysis. Beyond the issues that are faced for any policy, evaluation of
COVID-19 policies is complicated by additional challenges related to infectious
disease dynamics and lags, lack of direct observation of key outcomes, and a

volume, speed, and methodological complications of policy evaluations can make
it difficult for decision-makers and researchers to synthesize and evaluate

  Trend Analysis","COVID-19's impact has surpassed from personal and global health to our social
life. In terms of digital presence, it is speculated that during pandemic,
there has been a significant rise in cyberbullying. In this paper, we have
examined the hypothesis of whether cyberbullying and reporting of such
incidents have increased in recent times. To evaluate the speculations, we
collected cyberbullying related public tweets (N=454,046) posted between
January 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. A simple visual frequentist analysis
ignores serial correlation and does not depict changepoints as such. To address
correlation and a relatively small number of time points, Bayesian estimation
of the trends is proposed for the collected data via an autoregressive Poisson
model. We show that this new Bayesian method detailed in this paper can clearly
show the upward trend on cyberbullying-related tweets since mid-March 2020.
However, this evidence itself does not signify a rise in cyberbullying but
shows a correlation of the crisis with the discussion of such incidents by
individuals. Our work emphasizes a critical issue of cyberbullying and how a
global crisis impacts social media abuse and provides a trend analysis model
that can be utilized for social media data analysis in general.

Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis can be performed, which allows
deep insights into the most important model parameters and their interactions.
This information can be used to screen the parameters that should be further
investigated. To exemplify our approach, a capacity and resource planning task
for a hospital was simulated and optimized. The study explicitly covers
difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be shown, that even if
only limited real-world data is available, the BuB simulator can be
beneficially used to consider worst- and best-case scenarios. The BuB simulator

  Rate in Early Phase of COVID-19 Epidemic via Regularised Multi-task Feature
  Learning","Recent outbreak of COVID-19 has led a rapid global spread around the world.
Many countries have implemented timely intensive suppression to minimize the
infections, but resulted in high case fatality rate (CFR) due to critical
demand of health resources. Other country-based factors such as sociocultural
issues, ageing population etc., has also influenced practical effectiveness of
taking interventions to improve morality in early phase. To better understand
the relationship of these factors across different countries with COVID-19 CFR
is of primary importance to prepare for potentially second wave of COVID-19
infections. In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task learning
based factor analysis approach for quantifying country-based factors affecting
CFR in early phase of COVID-19 epidemic. We formulate the prediction of CFR
progression as a ML regression problem with observed CFR and other
countries-based factors. In this formulation, all CFR related factors were
categorized into 6 sectors with 27 indicators. We proposed a hybrid feature
selection method combining filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate
initial factors for a preliminary feature interaction. Then we adopted two
typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) and one state-of-the-art
MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) in our formulation. The fused sparse
group Lasso (FSGL) method allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of
country-based factors for multiple time points of COVID-19 epidemic and also
enables incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the whole early

  of mortality from the novel coronavirus infection in different regions of the
  Russian Federation","Relevance: Laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
infection combined with quarantine for contacts of infected individuals affects
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and levels of related mortality. Practices
for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For
example, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is
the highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for
COVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population,
while the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting
limited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg.
Methods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality
ratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and
deaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of
mortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation. Results:
The correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of mortality for
COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020 is
0.64 (0.50,0.75). For several regions of the Russian Federation, detectability
of SARS-CoV-2 infection is relatively low, while rates of mortality for
COVID-19 are relatively high. Conclusions: Detectability of the SARS-CoV-2
infection is one of the factors that affects the levels of mortality from
COVID-19. To increase detectability, one ought to test all individuals with
respiratory symptoms seeking medical care for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to
undertake additional measures to increase the volume of testing for SARS-CoV-2.
Such measures, in combination with quarantine for infected cases and their
close contacts help to mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and
diminish the related mortality.

is especially urgent during the current pandemic. We present a method to
determine the relative risk that can be readily deployed on either modelled or
monitored CO$_2$ data and occupancy levels within an indoor space. Moreover,
for spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied by the same group of people,
e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols to
assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at
work or school. In so doing, we are able to calculate the expected number of
infections arising from a single regular attendee becoming infectious and
remaining pre/asymptomatic, i.e. we present a robust methodology to calculate
the absolute reproductive number of these spaces. We demonstrate our model by
calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored
data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. Results suggest that
attendance at work is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic if
relatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate
ventilation. However, these spaces are likely to contribute significantly to
the pandemic if ventilation is inadequate and/or activity levels increase.

metrics that help define the loss of known information while transferring data
through a noisy channel. These metrics cannot be used for quantifying the
opposite process: the harvesting of new information. Correlation functions and
correlation coefficients do play an important role in collecting new
information from noisy sources. However, Bershad and Rockmore [1974] based
their formulas on contradictory a priori assumptions in Real-space and in
Fourier-space. Their formulations were subsequently copied literally to the
practical science of electron microscopy, where those a priori assumptions now
distort most quality metrics in Cryo-EM. Cryo-EM became a great success in
recent years [Wiley Award 2017; Nobel prize for Chemistry 2017] and became the
method of choice for revealing structures of biological complexes like
ribosomes, viruses, or corona-virus spikes, vitally important during the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Those early misconceptions now interfere with the
objective comparison of independently obtained results. We found that the roots
of these problems significantly pre-date those 1970s publications and were
already inherent in the original SNR definitions. We here propose novel metrics
to assess the amount of information harvested in an experiment, information
which is measured in bits. These new metrics assess the total amount of
information collected on an object, as well as the information density
distribution within that object. The new metrics can be applied everywhere
where data is collected, processed, compressed, or compared. As an example, we
compare the structures of two recently published SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. We
also introduce new metrics for transducer-quality assessment in many sciences

case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from
different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a
model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then
introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social
distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal
control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on
the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of
suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the
exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input
is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with
the implemented system of reopening `in phases'. For all the areas considered,
this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level
estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the
control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this
period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the
case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly
colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields
progressively stricter measures of social distancing. {We finally compute the
optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of
vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of
factors, social distancing measures could be optimally reduced during the

methodology. Metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion are commonly used
in practice to select models but do not incorporate the uncertainty of the
models' parameters and can give misleading choices. One approach that uses the
full posterior distribution is to compute the ratio of two models' normalising
constants, known as the Bayes factor. Often in realistic problems, this
involves the integration of analytically intractable, high-dimensional
distributions, and therefore requires the use of stochastic methods such as
thermodynamic integration (TI). In this paper we apply a variation of the TI
method, referred to as referenced TI, which computes a single model's
normalising constant in an efficient way by using a judiciously chosen
reference density. The advantages of the approach and theoretical
considerations are set out, along with explicit pedagogical 1 and 2D examples.
Benchmarking is presented with comparable methods and we find favourable
convergence performance. The approach is shown to be useful in practice when

  data analysis and optimal testing prescription","In this study, we address three important challenges related to the COVID-19
pandemic, namely, (a) providing an early warning to likely exposed individuals,
(b) identifying asymptomatic individuals, and (c) prescription of optimal
testing when testing capacity is limited. First, we present a dynamic-graph
based SEIR epidemiological model in order to describe the dynamics of the
disease transmission. Our model considers a dynamic graph/network that accounts
for the interactions between individuals over time, such as the ones obtained
by manual or automated contact tracing, and uses a diffusion-reaction mechanism
to describe the state dynamics. This dynamic graph model helps identify likely
exposed/infected individuals to whom we can provide early warnings, even before
they display any symptoms. When COVID-19 testing capacity is limited compared
to the population size, reliable estimation of individual's health state and
disease transmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging.
Thus, estimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk
assessment, as well as for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing
prescription. Therefore, we propose the use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos
Expansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification, to
represent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This
design enables us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and
consequently optimize the testing as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a
constrained testing budget. We present a few simulation results that illustrate
the performance of the proposed framework, and estimate the impact of
incomplete contact tracing data.

compartment (with four states) SIR(D) model. Our approach is similar to
non-parametric curve fitting in spirit and automatically adapts to key external
factors, such as interventions, while retaining the parsimonious nature of the
standard SIR(D) model. Initial dynamic temporal estimates of the model
parameters are obtained by minimising the aggregate residual sum of squares
across the number of infections, recoveries, and fatalities, over a chosen lag
period. Then a geometric smoother is applied to obtain the final time series of
estimates. These estimates are used to obtain dynamic temporal robust estimates
of the key feature of this pandemic, namely the ""reproduction number"". We
illustrate our method on the Indian COVID-19 data for the period March 14 -
August 31, 2020. The time series data plots of the 36 states and union
territories shows a clear presence of inter-regional variation in the prognosis
of the epidemic. This is also bourne out by the estimates of the underlying
parameters, including the reproduction numbers for the 36 regions. Due to this,
an SIR(D) model, dynamic or otherwise, on the national aggregate data is not
suited for robust local predictions. The time series of estimates of the model
enables us to carry out daily, weekly and also long term predictions, including
construction of predictive bands. We obtain an excellent agreement between the
actual data and the model predicted data at the regional level. Our estimates
of the current reproduction number turn out to be more than 2 in three regions
(Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) and between 1.5 and 2 in 13
regions. Each of these regions have experienced an individual trajectory, which
typically involves initial phase of shock(s) followed by a relatively steady
lower level of the reproduction number.

this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which
may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where
patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients
with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require
expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have
negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce
COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored
for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven
design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark
CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National
Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases.
Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an

COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both

  France","Large scale virological testing of SARS-Cov2 is implemented since May 2020 in
France. We assume that the positivity of asymptomatic people not being contact
cases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French
population, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using
Sant\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August
was about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning
of September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously
infected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce
that intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate
(IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036%
and 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on
the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France,
Ile de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations
are using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45
(1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which
occurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated
incidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks
induces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An
incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total
number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000
respectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed
close to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual
immunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of
October 2020. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously
thought, but its severity became limited since the end of the first wave.

epidemiology: estimating the empirical rate of transmission during an outbreak
(formally, the time-varying reproduction number) from case counts. While
standard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state
scales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial
observability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools
or towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of
infections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual
tests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they
are tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial
observability in a principled manner. Our model places a Gaussian process prior
over the unknown reproduction number at each time step and models observations
sampled from the distribution of a specific testing program. For example, our
framework can accommodate a variety of kinds of tests (viral RNA, antibody,
antigen, etc.) and sampling schemes (e.g., longitudinal or cross-sectional
screening). Inference in this framework is complicated by the presence of tens
or hundreds of thousands of discrete latent variables. To address this
challenge, we propose an efficient stochastic variational inference method
which relies on a novel gradient estimator for the variational objective.
Experimental results for an example motivated by COVID-19 show that our method
produces an accurate and well-calibrated posterior, while standard methods for
estimating the reproduction number can fail badly.

on surfaces with lifespan of more than hours. To curb its spread, it is hence
of vital importance to detect and quarantine those who have been in contact
with the virus for sustained period of time, the so-called close contacts. In
this work, we study, for the first time, automatic contact detection when the
virus has a lifespan. Leveraging upon the ubiquity of WiFi signals, we propose
a novel, private, and fully distributed WiFi-based approach called vContact.
Users installing an app continuously scan WiFi and store its hashed IDs. Given
a confirmed case, the signals of the major places he/she visited are then
uploaded to a server and matched with the stored signals of users to detect
contact. vContact is not based on phone pairing, and no information of any
other users is stored locally. The confirmed case does not need to have
installed the app for it to work properly. As WiFi data are sampled
sporadically, we propose efficient signal processing approaches and similarity
metric to align and match signals of any time. We conduct extensive indoor and
outdoor experiments to evaluate the performance of vContact. Our results
demonstrate that vContact is efficient and robust for contact detection. The
precision and recall of contact detection are high (in the range of 50-90%) for
close contact proximity (2m). Its performance is robust with respect to signal
lengths (AP numbers) and phone heterogeneity. By implementing vContact as an
app, we present a case study to demonstrate the validity of our design in
notifying its users their exposure to virus with lifespan.

international public health agencies, who have activated their pandemic plans
and opened the epidemiological toolkit of modelling, testing, isolation and
movement restrictions, surveillance, and contact tracing. In the contemporary
tech-heavy world, many assumed that the common manual process of human
investigators and phone calls could or should be replaced by digital solutions.
But it's not as simple as ""add more technology"" - the complex way in which
users and societies interact with the technology has significant impacts on
effectiveness. When efforts are not well co-ordinated, fragmentation in system
design and user experience can negatively impact the public health response.
This article briefly covers the journey of how contact tracing registers and
digital diaries evolved in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the
initial poor outcomes caused by the lack of central co-ordination, and the
later improvement.

  Lesion Segmentation in CT scans","Recently there has been an explosion in the use of Deep Learning (DL) methods
for medical image segmentation. However the field's reliability is hindered by
the lack of a common base of reference for accuracy/performance evaluation and
the fact that previous research uses different datasets for evaluation. In this
paper, an extensive comparison of DL models for lung and COVID-19 lesion
segmentation in Computerized Tomography (CT) scans is presented, which can also
be used as a benchmark for testing medical image segmentation models. Four DL
architectures (Unet, Linknet, FPN, PSPNet) are combined with 25 randomly
initialized and pretrained encoders (variations of VGG, DenseNet, ResNet,
ResNext, DPN, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-v4, EfficientNet), to construct
200 tested models. Three experimental setups are conducted for lung
segmentation, lesion segmentation and lesion segmentation using the original
lung masks. A public COVID-19 dataset with 100 CT scan images (80 for train, 20
for validation) is used for training/validation and a different public dataset
consisting of 829 images from 9 CT scan volumes for testing. Multiple findings
are provided including the best architecture-encoder models for each experiment
as well as mean Dice results for each experiment, architecture and encoder
independently. Finally, the upper bounds improvements when using lung masks as
a preprocessing step or when using pretrained models are quantified. The source

relevant knowledge from normal CT lung scans. Our modeling is inspired by the
observation that the parts of tracheae and vessels, which lay in the
high-intensity range where lesions belong to, exhibit strong patterns. To
facilitate the learning of such patterns at a pixel level, we synthesize
`lesions' using a set of surprisingly simple operations and insert the
synthesized `lesions' into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from
which we learn a normalcy-converting network (NormNet) that turns an 'abnormal'
image back to normal. Our experiments on three different datasets validate the
effectiveness of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of
unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods.

  COVID-19 Lockdown in France","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has urged many governments
in the world to enforce a strict lockdown where all nonessential businesses are
closed and citizens are ordered to stay at home. One of the consequences of
this policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since
load forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are
trained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused
by the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the
pandemic. This makes the scheduling of the electricity production challenging,
and has a high cost for both electricity producers and grid operators. In this
paper we introduce adaptive generalized additive models using Kalman filters
and fine-tuning to adjust to new electricity consumption patterns.
Additionally, knowledge from the lockdown in Italy is transferred to anticipate
the change of behavior in France. The proposed methods are applied to forecast
the electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they
demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to
traditional models. Finally expert aggregation is used to leverage the
specificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.

through a mixture of intuition and brute force. Namely, they use their know-how
to narrow down the set of logically conceivable policies to a small family
described by a few parameters, following which they conduct a grid search to
identify the optimal policy within the set. This scheme is not scalable, in the
sense that, when used to optimize over policies which depend on many
parameters, it would likely fail to output an optimal disease policy in time
for its implementation. In this article, we use techniques from convex
optimization theory and machine learning to conduct optimizations over disease
policies described by hundreds of parameters. We illustrate our approach by
minimizing the total time required to eradicate COVID-19 within the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model proposed by Kissler et al.
(March, 2020). We observe that optimal policies are typically very complex, and
thus unlikely to be discovered by a human agent.

  using Reinforcement Learning","A COVID-19 vaccine is our best bet for mitigating the ongoing onslaught of
the pandemic. However, vaccine is also expected to be a limited resource. An
optimal allocation strategy, especially in countries with access inequities and
temporal separation of hot-spots, might be an effective way of halting the
disease spread. We approach this problem by proposing a novel pipeline VacSIM
that dovetails Sequential Decision based RL models into a Contextual Bandits
approach for optimizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Whereas the
Reinforcement Learning models suggest better actions and rewards, Contextual
Bandits allow online modifications that may need to be implemented on a
day-to-day basis in the real world scenario. We evaluate this framework against
a naive allocation approach of distributing vaccine proportional to the
incidence of COVID-19 cases in five different States across India and
demonstrate up to 9039 additional lives potentially saved and a significant
increase in the efficacy of limiting the spread over a period of 45 days
through the VacSIM approach. We also propose novel evaluation strategies
including standard compartmental model-based projections and a causality
preserving evaluation of our model. Finally, we contribute a new Open-AI

  interact through supply chains?","To prevent the spread of COVID-19, many cities, states, and countries have
`locked down', restricting economic activities in non-essential sectors. Such
lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study
examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact
through supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an
agent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in
Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the
interactions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by
decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We
find that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier
substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the
economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region
lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on
whether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked
through supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy
coordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.

information from trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and derives concise
representations that are analyzed in an effective, unified way for prediction
purposes. It is well known that DNNs are capable of analyzing complex data;
however, they lack transparency in their decision making, in the sense that it
is not straightforward to justify their prediction, or to visualize the
features on which the decision was based. Moreover, they generally require
large amounts of data in order to learn and become able to adapt to different
environments. This makes their use difficult in healthcare, where trust and
personalization are key issues. Transparency combined with high prediction
accuracy are the targeted goals of the proposed approach. It includes both
supervised DNN training and unsupervised learning of latent variables extracted
from the trained DNNs. Domain Adaptation from multiple sources is also
presented as an extension, where the extracted latent variable representations
are used to generate predictions in other, non-annotated, environments.
Successful application is illustrated through a large experimental study in

tackle the cross-site domain shift by conducting separate feature normalization

classification performance on each dataset. We develop and evaluate our method
with two public large-scale COVID-19 diagnosis datasets made up of CT images.

  Filtering","While many approaches have been proposed for discovering abrupt changes in
piecewise constant signals, few methods are available to capture these changes
in piecewise polynomial signals. In this paper, we propose a change point
detection method, PRUTF, based on trend filtering. By providing a comprehensive
dual solution path for trend filtering, PRUTF allows us to discover change
points of the underlying signal for either a given value of the regularization
parameter or a specific number of steps of the algorithm. We demonstrate that
the dual solution path constitutes a Gaussian bridge process that enables us to
derive an exact and efficient stopping rule for terminating the search
algorithm. We also prove that the estimates produced by this algorithm are
asymptotically consistent in pattern recovery. This result holds even in the
case of staircases (consecutive change points of the same sign) in the signal.
Finally, we investigate the performance of our proposed method for various
signals and then compare its performance against some state-of-the-art methods
in the context of change point detection. We apply our method to three
real-world datasets including the UK House Price Index (HPI), the GISS surface
Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) and the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

  COVID-19 Using Chest X-Ray Images","With a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case count exceeding 10 million
worldwide, there is an increased need for a diagnostic capability. The main
variables in increasing diagnostic capability are reduced cost, turnaround or
diagnosis time, and upfront equipment cost and accessibility. Two candidates
for machine learning COVID-19 diagnosis are Computed Tomography (CT) scans and
plain chest X-rays. While CT scans score higher in sensitivity, they have a
higher cost, maintenance requirement, and turnaround time as compared to plain
chest X-rays. The use of portable chest X-radiograph (CXR) is recommended by
the American College of Radiology (ACR) since using CT places a massive burden
on radiology services. Therefore, X-ray imagery paired with machine learning
techniques is proposed a first-line triage tool for COVID-19 diagnostics. In
this paper we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to accurately classify
chest X-ray scans of COVID-19 and normal subjects by fine-tuning several neural
networks (ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet201) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
These neural networks are fused in a parallel architecture and the voting
criteria are applied in the final classification decision between the candidate
object classes where the output of each neural network is representing a single
vote. Several experiments are conducted on the weakly labeled COVID-19-CT-CXR
dataset consisting of 263 COVID-19 CXR images extracted from PubMed Central

analysis of the infection patterns are crucial for controlling infection spread
as well as devising a treatment plan. This work proposes a two-stage deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based framework for delineation of
COVID-19 infected regions in Lung CT images. In the first stage, initially,
COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete
wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the
proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images
classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the
identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we
propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically
uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This
systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed
CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region
homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with
mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a
standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the
existing deep CNN models. The performance of the proposed CoV-CTNet is
evaluated using Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) measure (0.98) and that of
proposed CoV-RASeg using Dice Similarity (DS) score (0.95). The promising
results on an unseen test set suggest that the proposed framework has the
potential to help the radiologists in the identification and analysis of
COVID-19 infected regions.

off between containing the spread of COVID-19 and maximizing economic impact.
This is of current importance as many organizations, cities, and states are
formulating reopening strategies. Our mechanisms, referred to as group
scheduling, are based on partitioning the population into groups and scheduling
each group on appropriate days with possible gaps (when all are quarantined).
Each group interacts with no other group and, importantly, any person who is
symptomatic in a group is quarantined. Specifically, our mechanisms are
characterized by three parameters $(g,d,t)$, where $g$ is the number of groups,
$d$ is the number of days a group is continuously scheduled, and $t$ is the gap
between cycles. We show that our mechanisms effectively trade off economic
activity for more effective control of the COVID-19 virus. In particular, we
show that the $(2,5,0)$ mechanism, which partitions the population into two
groups that alternatively work for five days each, flat lines the number of
COVID-19 cases quite effectively, while still maintaining economic activity at
70% of pre-COVID-19 level. We also study mechanisms such as $(2,3,2)$ and
$(3,3,0)$ that achieve a somewhat lower economic output (about 50%) at the cost
of more aggressive control of the virus; these could be applicable in
situations when the disease spread is more rampant in the population. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanisms by theoretical analysis and
extensive experimental simulations on various epidemiological models. Our
mechanisms prove beneficial just by regulating human interactions. Moreover,
our results show that if the disease transmission (reproductive) rate is made
lower by following social distancing, mask wearing, and other public health
guidelines, it can further increase the efficacy of our mechanisms.

assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental
health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included
late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the
internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions,
social activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies are required,

diseases including the COVID-19. More recently, many works construct deep
neural networks (DNNs) for chest X-ray images to realize automated and
efficient diagnosis of lung diseases. However, bias field caused by the
improper medical image acquisition process widely exists in the chest X-ray
images while the robustness of DNNs to the bias field is rarely explored, which
definitely poses a threat to the X-ray-based automated diagnosis system. In
this paper, we study this problem based on the recent adversarial attack and
propose a brand new attack, i.e., the adversarial bias field attack where the
bias field instead of the additive noise works as the adversarial perturbations
for fooling the DNNs. This novel attack posts a key problem: how to locally
tune the bias field to realize high attack success rate while maintaining its
spatial smoothness to guarantee high realisticity. These two goals contradict
each other and thus has made the attack significantly challenging. To overcome
this challenge, we propose the adversarial-smooth bias field attack that can
locally tune the bias field with joint smooth & adversarial constraints. As a
result, the adversarial X-ray images can not only fool the DNNs effectively but
also retain very high level of realisticity. We validate our method on real
chest X-ray datasets with powerful DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, DenseNet121, and
MobileNet, and show different properties to the state-of-the-art attacks in
both image realisticity and attack transferability. Our method reveals the
potential threat to the DNN-based X-ray automated diagnosis and can definitely

pandemic such as the COVID-19. In order to achieve efficient and scalable
contact-tracing in real time, digital devices can play an important role. While
a lot of attention has been paid to analyzing the privacy and ethical risks of
the associated mobile applications, so far much less research has been devoted
to optimizing their performance and assessing their impact on the mitigation of
the epidemic. We develop Bayesian inference methods to estimate the risk that
an individual is infected. This inference is based on the list of his recent
contacts and their own risk levels, as well as personal information such as
results of tests or presence of syndromes. We propose to use probabilistic risk
estimation in order to optimize testing and quarantining strategies for the
control of an epidemic. Our results show that in some range of epidemic
spreading (typically when the manual tracing of all contacts of infected people
becomes practically impossible, but before the fraction of infected people
reaches the scale where a lock-down becomes unavoidable), this inference of
individuals at risk could be an efficient way to mitigate the epidemic. Our
approaches translate into fully distributed algorithms that only require
communication between individuals who have recently been in contact. Such
communication may be encrypted and anonymized and thus compatible with privacy
preserving standards. We conclude that probabilistic risk estimation is capable
to enhance performance of digital contact tracing and should be considered in
the currently developed mobile applications.

in recent decades caused by geopolitical upheavals such as Brexit and now,
COVID-19. The way in which policy makers respond to the current pandemic could
have large effects on how the world looks after the pandemic subsides. We aim
to investigate complex questions post COVID-19 around the relationships and
intersections concerning nationalism, religiosity, and anti-immigrant sentiment
from a socio-cognitive perspective by applying a mixed-method approach (survey
and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion threats have caused
huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature
on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the
role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can
fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's
life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's
life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural
disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing).
These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and
other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist
and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin
to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our
theoretical framework and explore the different possible relationships in an
online sample. The second is a study of a computer simulation. Both studies
(completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables,

proportional contribution of NPIs on i) size of the change (magnitude) of
transition between pre- and post-lockdown mobility levels and ii) rate
(gradient) of this transition. Using generalized linear models to find the best
fit model we found similar results using Apple or Google data. NPIs found to
impact the magnitude of the change in mobility were: Lockdown measures (Apple,
Google Retail and Recreation (RAR) and Google Transit and Stations (TS)),
declaring a state of emergency (Apple, Google RAR and Google TS), closure of
businesses and public services (Google RAR) and school closures (Apple). Using
cluster analysis and chi square tests we found that closure of businesses and
public services, school closures and limiting public gatherings as well as
border closures and international flight suspensions were closely related. The
implementation of lockdown measures and limiting public gatherings had the
greatest effect on the rate of mobility change. In conclusion, we were able to
quantitatively assess the efficacy of NPIs in reducing mobility, which enables
us to understand their fine grained effects in a timely manner and therefore
facilitate well-informed and cost-effective interventions.

  in Computed Tomography Scans: An Ablation Study","Amidst the ongoing pandemic, several studies have shown that COVID-19
classification and grading using computed tomography (CT) images can be
automated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Many of these studies
focused on reporting initial results of algorithms that were assembled from
commonly used components. The choice of these components was often pragmatic
rather than systematic. For instance, several studies used 2D CNNs even though
these might not be optimal for handling 3D CT volumes. This paper identifies a
variety of components that increase the performance of CNN-based algorithms for
COVID-19 grading from CT images. We investigated the effectiveness of using a
3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN, of using transfer learning to initialize the
network, of providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network
input, and of predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D CNN
with these components achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934 on
our test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.923 on a publicly available set of
742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously
published 2D CNN. An ablation study demonstrated that in addition to using a 3D
CNN instead of a 2D CNN transfer learning contributed the most and continuous
output contributed the least to improving the model performance.

perspectives. First, the dynamics of the cryptocurrency exchange rates to other
cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies can be studied and quantified by means of
multifractal formalism. Second, coupling and decoupling of the cryptocurrencies

significant events like double bull and bear phases in 2019. We show that,
throughout the considered interval, the exchange rate returns were multifractal

most volatile periods of the market dynamics like a bull market onset in April
2019 and the Covid-19 outburst in March 2020. The topology of a minimal

9, 50, 625 deaths in 212 countries over the last few months. Different drug
intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of COVID-19 can
substantially reduce the infection induced mortality. The current within-host
mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal drug regimen and the
efficacy of combined therapy in treatment of COVID-19. The drugs/interventions
considered include Arbidol, Remdesivir, Inteferon (INF) and
Lopinavir/Ritonavir. It is concluded that these drug interventions when
administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and viral
load. Four scenarios involving administration of single drug intervention, two
drug interventions, three drug interventions and all the four have been
discussed. In all these scenarios the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on
two methods. In the first method these medical interventions are modeled as
control interventions and a corresponding objective function and optimal
control problem is formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is
proposed. Later using the the comparative effectiveness method the optimal drug
regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction number and viral load. The
average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four
interventions were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible
cell count decreased the best when Arbidol alone was administered. The basic
reproduction number and viral count decreased the best when all the four
interventions were applied together reinstating the fact obtained earlier in
the optimal control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision
making in treatment of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.

  Learning","Since December of 2019, novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has spread around
the world infecting millions of people and upending the global economy. One of
the driving reasons behind its high rate of infection is due to the
unreliability and lack of RT-PCR testing. At times the turnaround results span
as long as a couple of days, only to yield a roughly 70% sensitivity rate. As
an alternative, recent research has investigated the use of Computer Vision
with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19
from CT scans. Due to an inherent lack of available COVID-19 CT data, these
research efforts have been forced to leverage the use of Transfer Learning.
This commonly employed Deep Learning technique has shown to improve model
performance on tasks with relatively small amounts of data, as long as the
Source feature space somewhat resembles the Target feature space.
Unfortunately, a lack of similarity is often encountered in the classification
of medical images as publicly available Source datasets usually lack the visual
features found in medical images. In this study, we propose the use of
Multi-Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) to improve upon traditional Transfer
Learning for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. With our
multi-source fine-tuning approach, our models outperformed baseline models
fine-tuned with ImageNet. We additionally, propose an unsupervised label

technique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the
Chest X-rays. However, most variant U-Nets mainly focus on extraction of

improving extraction of spatial features. In this paper, we propose a dual
encoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception
Convolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent
Convolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net. The densely connected
recurrent path extends the network deeper for facilitating contextual feature

COVID19-specific themes. An innovative COVID19 Impact Assessment algorithm was
also developed using homogeneity and trend assessment technique for evaluating
severity of the pandemic in all counties and train RF model. Developed C19VI
was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID19 Community
Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI along with census data, we
explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID19 health
outcomes amongst different regions in the United States. Our C19VI index
indicates that 18.30% of the counties falls into very high vulnerability class,
24.34% in high, 23.32% in moderate, 22.34% in low, and 11.68% in very low.
Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities and 82.84% of
economically poor communities are very high or high COVID19 vulnerable regions.
The proposed approach of vulnerability modeling takes advantage of both the
well-established field of statistical analysis and the fast-evolving domain of
machine learning. C19VI provides an accurate and more reliable way to measure
county level vulnerability in the United States. This index aims at helping
emergency planners to develop more effective mitigation strategies especially

  of Flu and COVID-19","Forecasting influenza in a timely manner aids health organizations and
policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. However, effective
influenza forecasting still remains a challenge despite increasing research
interest. It is even more challenging amidst the COVID pandemic, when the
influenza-like illness (ILI) counts are affected by various factors such as
symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 and shift in healthcare seeking patterns
of the general population. Under the current pandemic, historical influenza
models carry valuable expertise about the disease dynamics but face
difficulties adapting. Therefore, we propose CALI-Net, a neural transfer
learning architecture which allows us to 'steer' a historical disease
forecasting model to new scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. Our framework
enables this adaptation by automatically learning when it should emphasize
learning from COVID-related signals and when it should learn from the
historical model. Thus, we exploit representations learned from historical ILI
data as well as the limited COVID-related signals. Our experiments demonstrate
that our approach is successful in adapting a historical forecasting model to
the current pandemic. In addition, we show that success in our primary goal,
adaptation, does not sacrifice overall performance as compared with
state-of-the-art influenza forecasting approaches.

considerably when applied to a variable PPE consumption profile. Experiments
conducted for NHS England regions using actual data confirm that the challenge

stock management procedures are adopted. These procedures can include early
stockpiling, increasing storage capacities and implementing measures that can
prolong the time period between successive infection waves, such as social

dedicated storage space can be a viable solution to avoid straining PPE supply
chains in case a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurs.

  in realistic urban setting","The dense social contact networks and high mobility in congested urban areas
facilitate the rapid transmission of infectious diseases. Typical mechanistic
epidemiological models are either based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact
processes or need real-time or archived population mobility data to simulate
the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the novel
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to unprecedented lockdowns at global and
regional scales, leaving the archived datasets to limited use. While it is
often hypothesized that population density is a significant driver in disease
propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection rates exhibited
by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution
description of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the
impact of the creation of containment zones on travel patterns within the city.
Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious disease model to
understand the key drivers of disease spread at sub-kilometer scales
demonstrated in the city of Ahmedabad, India, which has been classified as a
SARS-CoV-2 hotspot. We find that in addition to the contact network and
population density, road connectivity patterns and ease of transit are strongly
correlated with the rate of transmission of the disease. Given the limited
access to real-time traffic data during lockdowns, we generate road
connectivity networks using open-source imageries and travel patterns from
open-source surveys and government reports. Within the proposed framework, we
then analyze the relative merits of social distancing, enforced lockdowns, and
enhanced testing and quarantining mitigating the disease spread.

  Learning GAN","COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease responsible for over 800K deaths
worldwide as of August 2020. The need for rapid testing is a high priority and
alternative testing strategies including X-ray image classification are a
promising area of research. However, at present, public datasets for COVID19
x-ray images have low data volumes, making it challenging to develop accurate
image classifiers. Several recent papers have made use of Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to increase the training data volumes. But
realistic synthetic COVID19 X-rays remain challenging to generate. We present a
novel Mean Teacher + Transfer GAN (MTT-GAN) that generates COVID19 chest X-ray
images of high quality. In order to create a more accurate GAN, we employ
transfer learning from the Kaggle Pneumonia X-Ray dataset, a highly relevant
data source orders of magnitude larger than public COVID19 datasets.
Furthermore, we employ the Mean Teacher algorithm as a constraint to improve
stability of training. Our qualitative analysis shows that the MTT-GAN
generates X-ray images that are greatly superior to a baseline GAN and visually
comparable to real X-rays. Although board-certified radiologists can
distinguish MTT-GAN fakes from real COVID19 X-rays. Quantitative analysis shows
that MTT-GAN greatly improves the accuracy of both a binary COVID19 classifier
as well as a multi-class Pneumonia classifier as compared to a baseline GAN.
Our classification accuracy is favourable as compared to recently reported
results in the literature for similar binary and multi-class COVID19 screening
tasks.

social distancing remains untackled in academy. Beyond isolated efforts (from
sidewalk widenings to car-free Open Streets), there is a need for a large-scale
and quantitative strategy for cities to handle the challenges that COVID-19
poses in the use of public space. The main obstacle is a generalized lack of
publicly available data on sidewalk infrastructure worldwide, and thus city
governments have not yet benefited from a complex systems approach of treating
urban sidewalks as networks. Here, we leverage sidewalk geometries from ten
cities in three continents, to first analyze sidewalk and roadbed geometries,
and find that cities most often present an arrogant distribution of public
space: imbalanced and unfair with respect to pedestrians. Then, we connect
these geometries to build a sidewalk network --adjacent, but not assimilable to
road networks, so fertile in urban science. In a no-intervention scenario, we
apply percolation theory to examine whether the sidewalk infrastructure in
cities can withstand the tight pandemic social distancing imposed on our
streets. The resulting collapse of sidewalk networks, often at widths below
three meters, calls for a cautious strategy, taking into account the
interdependencies between a city's sidewalk and road networks, as any
improvement for pedestrians comes at a cost for motor transport. With notable
success, we propose a shared-effort heuristic that delays the sidewalk
connectivity breakdown, while preserving the road network's functionality.

Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly
applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used, which are
the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower lungs. To improve the
segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating
five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical
relevance of the proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the

dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods

months away. Over 100 years ago, Spanish flu fatalities were attenuated when
doctors began treating patients with blood plasma donated by recovered (or
convalesced) survivors. Passive immunity transfer via administration of
convalesced blood product (CBP) appears to represent a readily available and
promising avenue for mitigating mortalities, expediting recovery time, and even
prophylaxis against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we review challenges to CBP
efficacy, and present a graph theoretical model of transmission dynamics that
identifies evolving hubs of COVID-19 cases. Importantly, this model suggests
that CBP efficacy may rest on an efficient and distributed global sampling
scheme as opposed to CBP pooled from local donors alone.

bioinformatics based in silico drug discovery can be applied as a very robust

trials for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, these candidate drugs were
ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike protein and RdRp

their action as well as how the virus infection can utilize Hemoglobin to
decrease the oxygen level in blood is explained. Moreover, multiple sequence
alignments of the Spike protein with 75 sequences of different viruses from the
Orthocoronavirinae subfamily were performed. This gives insight into the

However, within a short period, the quality sectors start recovering from the

antifragility ($\phi$) of a company. We assume that during the crash, the stock

possibility of recovery of stock with $\phi>0$, termed as quality stock,
decreases with an increase in shock-length beyond a specific period. A quality
stock with higher $\phi$ shows V-shape recovery and outperform others. The
shock length and recovery period of quality stock are almost equal that is seen
in the Indian market. Financially stressed stocks, i.e., the stocks with
$\phi<0$, show L-shape recovery during the pandemic. The stock data and model

testing) is more efficient in reducing the number of tests and potentially
leading to tremendous cost reduction. As indicated in the recent article posted
on the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a
lot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing
technique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into
groups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to
reconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family
of pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite
projective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices
proposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using
the two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting
extensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical
results show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in
the whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one
should choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The
family of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according
to the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed
pooling matrix.

  Memory Models","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been posing severe threat to public
health around the world by causing the infectious coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). A key challenge of controlling COVID-19 is the large proportion of
asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (ACCs) that makes breaking the transmission chains
even harder. Unfortunately, till now there is still a lack of cost-effective
approaches to detect ACCs except doing a medical screening of the entire
population. This paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal
Episodic Memory for COVID-19 tracing (STEM-COVID) for identifying ACCs from
contact tracing data. Based on fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (fusion ART),
STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal
episodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs
can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the
episodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the
effectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is
implemented based on recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experimental
results based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model
is able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and
efficiency.

real data depends on powerful estimation algorithms. Moreover, uncertainty
quantification in such models is far from trivial, and different types of
uncertainty are often confounded. With this work, we introduce a novel coupling
between epidemiological models and specialized neural network architectures.
This coupling results in a powerful Bayesian inference framework capable of

corona virus causing respiratory disease is a big concern worldwide since the
end of December 2019. As of September 12, 2020, it has turned into an epidemic
outbreak with more than 29 million confirmed cases and around 1 million
reported deaths worldwide. It has created an urgent need to monitor and
forecast COVID-19 spread behavior to better control this spread. Among all the
popular models for COVID-19 forecasting, statistical models are receiving much
attention in media. However, statistical models are showing less accuracy for
long term forecasting, as there is high level of uncertainty and required data
is also not sufficiently available. In this paper, we propose a comparative
analysis of deep learning models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak as an
alternative to statistical models. We propose a new Attention-based
encoder-decoder model, named Attention-Long Short Term Memory (AttentionLSTM).
LSTM based neural network layer architecture incorporates the idea of
fine-grained attention mechanism i.e., attention on hidden state dimensions
instead of hidden state vector itself, which is capable of highlighting the
importance and contribution of each hidden state dimension. It helps in
detection on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable
network. Additionally, we implement a learnable vector embedding for time. As,
time in a vector representation can be easily added with many architectures.
This vector representation is called Time2Vec. We have used COVID-19 data
repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns
Hopkins University to assess the proposed model's performance. The proposed
model give superior forecasting accuracy compared to other existing methods.

  single and multi-layer face masks","By now it is well-understood that the usage of facemasks provides protection
from transmission of viral loads through exhalation and inhalation of
respiratory droplets. Therefore, during the current Covid-19 pandemic the usage
of face masks is strongly recommended by health officials. Although three-layer
masks are generally advised for usage, many commonly available or homemade
masks contain only single and double layers. In this study, we show through
detailed physics based analyses and high speed imaging that high momentum cough
droplets on impingement on single- and double-layer masks can lead to
significant partial penetration and more importantly atomization into numerous
much smaller daughter droplets, thereby increasing the total population of the
aerosol, which can remain suspended for a longer time. The possibility of
secondary atomization of high momentum cough droplets due to impingement,
hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous
network of the mask has not been explored before. However, this unique mode of
aerosol generation poses a finite risk of infection as shown in this work. We
also demonstrate that in single layer masks close to 70 % of a given droplet
volume is atomized and only 30 % is trapped within the fibers. The entrapped
volume is close to 90 % for double layer masks which still allows some
atomization into smaller droplets. We however found that a triple-layer
surgical mask permits negligible penetration and hence should be effective in
preventing disease transmission.

two classes, the vulnerable and the fit, with different lockdown regimes.
Instead of one reproduction number there now are four parameters. These make it
possible to quantify the effect of the social distancing measures. There is a
simple stochastic model for epidemics in a two type population. Apart from the
size of the population of the vulnerable and the fit, and the initial number of
infected in the two classes, only the four reproduction parameters are needed
to run the two type Reed-Frost model. The program is simple and fast. On a pc
it takes less than five minutes to do a hundred thousand simulations of the
epidemic for a population of the size of the US. Epidemics are non-linear
processes. Results may be counterintuitive. The average number of vulnerable
persons infected by an infectious fit person is a crucial parameter of the
epidemic in the two type population. Intuitively this parameter should be
small. However simulations show that even if this parameter is small the death
toll may be higher than without shielding. Under certain conditions increasing
the value of the parameter may reduce the death toll. The article addresses
these blind spots in our intuition.

The technique can track the path traversed by the patient and collect the cell

privacy of this group of people, who are contacted through their cell numbers
so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test
arrives. If a test result of a person comes positive among the group, then
he/she must be isolated and same CDRA and contact tracing procedures are
adopted for that person. A COVID-19 patient is geo tagged and alerts are sent
if any violation of isolation is done by the patient. Moreover, the general
public is informed in advance to avoid the path followed by the patients. This
cost effective mechanism is not only capable to control the coronavirus
outbreak but also helps in isolating the patient in his/her house.

resilience to allow a continuous and reliable energy supply has tremendously
increased even during adverse events (e.g., Ukraine cyber-attack, Hurricane
Maria). The global pandemic COVID-19 has raised the electric energy reliability
risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and
increased possible cybersecurity threats. The pandemic introduces a significant
degree of uncertainly to the grid operation in the presence of other extreme
events like natural disasters, unprecedented outages, aging power grids, high
proliferation of distributed generation, and cyber-attacks. This situation
increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate
the impacts of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events. Solutions
to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: a) emergency planning
and organizational support, b) following safety protocol, c) utilizing enhanced
automation and sensing for situational awareness, and d) integration of
advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support.
Enhanced digitalization and automation resulted in better network visibility at
various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution. These
data or information can be utilized to take advantage of advanced machine
learning techniques for automation and increased power grid resilience. In this
paper, a) we review the impact of COVID-19 on power grid operations and actions
taken by operators/organizations to minimize the impact of COVID-19, and b) we
have presented the recently developed tool and concepts using natural language
processing (NLP) in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence
that can be used for increasing resiliency of power systems in normal and in
extreme scenarios such as COVID-19 pandemics.

  Generation via Risk Estimation","Understanding the relationships between biomedical terms like viruses, drugs,
and symptoms is essential in the fight against diseases. Many attempts have
been made to introduce the use of machine learning to the scientific process of
hypothesis generation(HG), which refers to the discovery of meaningful implicit
connections between biomedical terms. However, most existing methods fail to
truly capture the temporal dynamics of scientific term relations and also
assume unobserved connections to be irrelevant (i.e., in a positive-negative
(PN) learning setting). To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as
future connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via
positive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal
evolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and
unlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the
positive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings,
which are then used for link prediction. Experiment results on real-world
biomedical term relationship datasets and case study analyses on a COVID-19
dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

revealing the so-called electromagnetic echo effect (EMEE). The EMEE signal is
highly sensitive even to small changes in the composition and properties of the

provides real-time analysis, and can be considered universal. We have an idea
to create a sensor to detect COVID-19 in three cases -- in the air, on hard
surfaces, and in fluids from the human body. The approach involves detecting
specific reactions to the virus, even if they are invisible without specialized
equipment. Our experience shows that the EMEE signal is very sensitive to weak
or practically imperceptible reactions. Therefore, we believe that it is quite
possible to register the presence of COVID-19. We have many experimental
results in this regard that support this idea. We have experience in creating
sensors to monitor the processes, composition, and properties of fluids
(including biological ones), as well as to detect pollution and contamination

causing high pressure on the health-system facilities. PCR screening is the
adopted diagnostic testing method for COVID-19 detection. However, PCR is
criticized due its low sensitivity ratios, also, it is time-consuming and
manual complicated process. CT imaging proved its ability to detect the disease

In addition, the appearance of COVID-19 infections in CT slices, offers high
potential to support in disease evolution monitoring using automated infection

in term of size, shape, contrast and intensity homogeneity, which impose a big

proposed an automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 infection areas

infection areas appearance in the CT slices so they can be learned efficiently
using the deep network. The system start prepare the region of interest by
segmenting the lung organ, which then undergo edge enhancing diffusion

homogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with
modified residual block with concatenation skip connection. The block improves
the learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features
through the network. To demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the
proposed system, it is trained and tested using many 2D CT slices extracted

ecosystem, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid adoption of
telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this
paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the
telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is
particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other
health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit
images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of
insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have
experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor
quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time
for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image
assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality
dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our
experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject 50% of the sub-par quality
images, while retaining 80% of good quality images patients send in, despite
heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results
suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of

  A Review","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
discovered coronavirus. The disease presents with symptoms such as shortness of
breath, fever, dry cough, and chronic fatigue, amongst others. Sometimes the
symptoms of the disease increase so much they lead to the death of the
patients. The disease may be asymptomatic in some patients in the early stages,
which can lead to increased transmission of the disease to others. Many studies
have tried to use medical imaging for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This study
attempts to review papers on automatic methods for medical image analysis and
diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv and
medRxiv were searched to find related studies by the end of April 2020, and the
essential points of the collected studies were summarised. The contribution of
this study is four-fold: 1) to use as a tutorial of the field for both
clinicians and technologists, 2) to comprehensively review the characteristics
of COVID-19 as presented in medical images, 3) to examine automated artificial
intelligence-based approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis based on the accuracy and
the method used, 4) to express the research limitations in this field and the
methods used to overcome them. COVID-19 reveals signs in medical images can be
used for early diagnosis of the disease even in asymptomatic patients. Using
automated machine learning-based methods can diagnose the disease with high
accuracy from medical images and reduce time, cost and error of diagnostic

the epidemic unfolds. Different efforts have been made, with compartmental
models in epidemiology and statistical models such as AutoRegressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (ETS) or computing intelligence
models. These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision
makers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their
accuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less
attention is given to local areas. In this study, we propose a simple Multiple
Linear Regression model, optimised to use call data to forecast the number of
daily confirmed cases. Moreover, we produce a probabilistic forecast that
allows decision makers to better deal with risk. Our proposed approach
outperforms ARIMA, ETS and a regression model without call data, evaluated by
three point forecast error metrics, one prediction interval and two
probabilistic forecast accuracy measures. The simplicity, interpretability and
reliability of the model, obtained in a careful forecasting exercise, is a
meaningful contribution to decision makers at local level who acutely need to
organise resources in already strained health services. We hope that this model
would serve as a building block of other forecasting efforts that on the one
hand would help front-line personal and decision makers at local level, and on
the other would facilitate the communication with other modelling efforts being
made at the national level to improve the way we tackle this pandemic and other

where the parameters are given by piecewise constant functions. This allows us
to model the human behavior and the impact of public health policies on the
dynamics of the curve of active infected individuals during a COVID-19 epidemic
outbreak. After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the
disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant
parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant
parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a
neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic
equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of
epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of
COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions
based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for
the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology that
minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of
topologies that are likely to worsen the level of infection. We claim that this
methodology is a tool with enormous potential in the current pandemic context,
and can be applied in the management of outbreaks (in regional terms) but also
to manage the opening/closing of borders.

  COVID-19 pandemic in Chinese mainland","Revealing spatiotemporal evolution regularity in the spatial diffusion of
epidemics is helpful for preventing and controlling the spread of epidemics.
Based on the real-time COVID-19 datasets by prefecture-level cities and date,
this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling in spatial diffusion
pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese
mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract
spatial data and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal
parameters. The results show multifractal distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in
China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped
curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean
dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity
spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal
dimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped curves. From these
spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows.
First, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic,
which seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of
COVID-19 across China can be characterized by global clustering with local
disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 in China
experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the
hierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study
suggests that multifractal theory can be utilized to characterize
spatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic, and the case analyses may be
instructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.

  Early Cases of COVID-19","As of September 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate the health
and well-being of the global population. With more than 33 million confirmed
cases and over a million deaths, global health organizations are still a long
way from fully containing the pandemic. This pandemic has raised serious
questions about the emergency preparedness of health agencies, not only in
terms of treatment of an unseen disease, but also in identifying its early
symptoms. In the particular case of COVID-19, several studies have indicated
that chest radiography images of the infected patients show characteristic
abnormalities. However, at the onset of a given pandemic, such as COVID-19,
there may not be sufficient data for the affected cases to train models for
their robust detection. Hence, supervised classification is ill-posed for this
problem because the time spent in collecting large amounts of infected peoples'
data could lead to the loss of human lives and delays in preventive
interventions. Therefore, we formulate this problem within a one-class
classification framework, in which the data for healthy patients is abundantly
available, whereas no training data is present for the class of interest
(COVID-19 in our case). To solve this problem, we present COVIDomaly, a
convolutional autoencoder framework to detect unseen COVID-19 cases from the
chest radiographs. We tested two settings on a publicly available dataset
(COVIDx) by training the model on chest X-rays from (i) only healthy adults,
and (ii) healthy and other non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and detected COVID-19 as an
anomaly. After performing 3-fold cross validation, we obtain a pooled ROC-AUC
of 0.7652 and 0.6902 in the two settings respectively. These results are very
encouraging and pave the way towards research for ensuring emergency
preparedness in future pandemics, especially the ones that could be detected
from chest X-rays.

public health crisis unseen in recent years. It is known that the structure of
the human contact network plays an important role in the spread of
transmissible diseases. In this work, we study a structure aware model of
COVID-19 CGEM. This model becomes similar to the classical compartment-based
models in epidemiology if we assume the contact network is a Erdos-Renyi (ER)
graph, i.e. everyone comes into contact with everyone else with the same
probability. In contrast, CGEM is more expressive and allows for plugging in
the actual contact networks, or more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM
enables more precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different
non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set of extensive
experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves
when assuming different underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate
that the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread of the
infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the
compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs,
mischaracterizing others (e.g. predicting a later peak), and underestimating
the scale of the second peak after reopening.

another one for its decaying rate. The resultant time-dependent SI model, which
under extra conditions recovers the standard Gompertz functional form, is then

introduced by Barnes, in which a hidden (isolated from the virus) compartment
$H$ is gradually populated by susceptible people, thus reducing the
effectiveness of the virus spreading. By introducing a partial hiding
mechanism, for instance due to the impossibility for a fraction of the
population to enter the hidden state, we obtain a model that, although still
sufficiently simple, faithfully reproduces the different deceleration trends
observed in several major countries.

  nanoparticles","The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) threatens global medical systems and economies, and rules our
daily living life. Controlling the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has become one of the
most important and urgent strategies throughout the whole world. As of October,
2020, there have not yet been any medicines or therapies to be effective
against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, rapid and sensitive diagnostics is the most important
measures to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Homogeneous biosensing based on
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is one of the most promising approaches for rapid
and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. This paper proposes an approach
for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized MNPs via
the measurement of their magnetic response in an ac magnetic field.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows the rapid
detection of mimic SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 0.084 nM (5.9
fmole). The proposed approach has great potential for designing a low-cost and
point-of-care device for rapid and sensitive diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.

regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a
decline after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second
wave. The current immunity level $\hat i$ in a region is closely related to the
cumulative fraction infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the
initial potential for COVID-19 in the region (often quantified by the basic
reproduction number $R_0$), and b) the timing, amount and effectiveness of
preventive measures put in place. By means of a mathematical model including
heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and susceptibility, and allowing
for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new epidemic wave and its
doubling time, and how they depend on $R_0$, $\hat i$ and the overall effect of
the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying
the minimal overall effect of preventive measures $p_{Min}$ needed to prevent a
future outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level $\hat
i$ plays a more influential roll than when immunity is obtained from
vaccination. Secondly, by comparing regions with different $R_0$ and $\hat i$
it is shown that regions with lower $R_0$ and low $\hat i$ may now need higher
preventive measures ($p_{Min}$) compared with other regions having higher $R_0$
but also higher $\hat i$, even when such immunity levels are far from herd
immunity.

  for Tackling COVID-19","The current COVID-19 global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus
has resulted in over a million deaths and is having a grave socio-economic
impact, hence there is an urgency to find solutions to key research challenges.
Much of this COVID-19 research depends on distributed computing. In this
article, I review distributed architectures -- various types of clusters, grids
and clouds -- that can be leveraged to perform these tasks at scale, at
high-throughput, with a high degree of parallelism, and which can also be used
to work collaboratively. High-performance computing (HPC) clusters will be used
to carry out much of this work. Several bigdata processing tasks used in
reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require high-throughput approaches, and a
variety of tools, which Hadoop and Spark offer, even using commodity hardware.
Extremely large-scale COVID-19 research has also utilised some of the world's
fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's SUMMIT -- for ensemble docking
high-throughput screening against SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug-repurposing, and
high-throughput gene analysis -- and Sentinel, an XPE-Cray based system used to
explore natural products. Grid computing has facilitated the formation of the
world's first Exascale grid computer. This has accelerated COVID-19 research in
molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions through
massively-parallel computation and was performed with over 1 million volunteer
computing devices using the Folding@home platform. Grids and clouds both can
also be used for international collaboration by enabling access to important
datasets and providing services that allow researchers to focus on research
rather than on time-consuming data-management tasks.

  behavioural changes","Pandemics such as COVID-19 have lethal potential for inflicting long-lasting
cyclic devastations if required preventive, curative and reformative steps are
not taken up in time which puts forth mammoth multi-dimensional challenges for
survival before mankind. Scientists and policymakers all around are striving to
achieve R $\leq$ 1 alongside having less number of CoVID-19 patients. Lockdowns
all across the globe have been implemented for the sake of social physical
distancing. However, even if the desired R value status is achieved it becomes
nowhere near safe. As normal social activity and inter-regional travel resumes,
danger of contraction of the virus from undetected asymptomatic carriers and
reactivation of the virus in previously affected patients looms over. The virus
poses further threat due to its chances of resurgence, its mutative and
adaptive nature thereby giving limited medical respite. The problems intensify
with increasing population density whilst varying with several
socio-economic-geo-cultural and human activity parameters. Such zoonotic
pandemics unravel the primary challenges of all countries in securing the
general wellbeing of the society. Ensuring a mechanism for policy designs
envisaging crisis scenarios through continuous analysis of real-time
region-specific data about societal activities and disease/health indicators
can be the only solution. An approach perspective is discussed for addressing

previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected
countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series
data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging

lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter

  Component Analysis of Weekly Mortality Data -- The Case of COVID-19","The current outbreak of COVID-19 has called renewed attention to the need for
sound statistical analysis for monitoring mortality patterns and trends over
time. Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to
measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality. As such, excess
mortality has received considerable interest during the first months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are
somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends,
correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, and the
autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased
estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be
misinterpreted as excess mortality. We present a blend of classical
epidemiological approaches to estimating excess mortality during extraordinary
events with an established demographic approach in mortality forecasting,
namely a Lee-Carter type model, which covers the named limitations and draws a
more realistic picture of the excess mortality. We illustrate our approach
using weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the
current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our proposed model provides a
general framework that can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor
excess mortality from specific causes of deaths.

worldwide that was responding with a sudden shift to distance learning. Various
physics courses such as lectures, tutorials, and the laboratories had to be
transferred into online formats rapidly, resulting in a variety of
simultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics
students perceived the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a
questionnaire and gathered data from N = 578 physics students from five
universities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how
the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how
students' judge different formats of the courses and how useful and effective
they perceive them. The results are correlated to the students' self-efficacy
ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills)
and demographics. In a related article, we focus on the online physics lectures
and compare simultaneous vs. asynchronous teaching and learning methods (n.n.).
We find that good communication abilities and self-organization skills are
positively correlated for perceived learning achievement. Furthermore, the
previous duration of studies had a significant impact on the students'
perceived overall learning achievement, on the students' acquisition of
experimental skills during the physics laboratories, and on their assessment of
the recitations' effectiveness. That is, students in their first academic year
show consistently lower scores than more progressed students. For the physics
laboratories, it was found that gathering real data was crucial to the

  COVID-19","Twitter influences political debates. Phenomena like fake news and hate
speech show that political discourse on micro-blogging can become strongly
polarised by algorithmic enforcement of selective perception. Some political
actors actively employ strategies to facilitate polarisation on Twitter, as
past contributions show, via strategies of 'hashjacking'. For the example of
COVID-19 related hashtags and their retweet networks, we examine the case of
partisan accounts of the German far-right party Alternative f\""ur Deutschland
(AfD) and their potential use of 'hashjacking' in May 2020. Our findings
indicate that polarisation of political party hashtags has not changed
significantly in the last two years. We see that right-wing partisans are
actively and effectively polarising the discourse by 'hashjacking' COVID-19
related hashtags, like #CoronaVirusDE or #FlattenTheCurve. This polarisation
strategy is dominated by the activity of a limited set of heavy users. The
results underline the necessity to understand the dynamics of discourse
polarisation, as an active political communication strategy of the far-right,
by only a handful of very active accounts.

  Using Deep Stacked-Ensembles","The issue of COVID-19, increasing notably with a massive mortality rate has
led to the WHO declaring it as a pandemic. The unavailability of an antiviral
drug has also led to dismay world-wide. The diagnostic tests are performed by
collecting samples inserting a swab into the nasal or oral cavity. These
collected samples and then sent to laboratories for viral-tests. Recently,
chest radiographs are used to observe the proportion of virus in the lungs at
various section-scans. As laboratory testing is time-consuming with a lot of
human effort, diagnosis using chest radiographs is considered to be a befitting
choice. In this research, a stacked-ensemble model is designed to classify
whether a patient is infected with COVID-19, viral-pneumonia or has a healthy
profile by considering chest X-ray images. A lot of complications were observed
from existing literature in classifying COVID-19 radiographic images and are
eliminated using our methodology. A training algorithm is constructed to speed
up the training process which acquired good generalisations. The proposed model
resulted in state-of-the-art outcomes with an accuracy score of 99.48% for
binary classification and 97.4% for tri-class classification. Additionally,
visualisations are illustrated for a detailed comprehension of the model's
perception for the information provided to it.

this second wave manifests itself strongly in new reported cases, but less in
death counts compared to the first wave. Over the past three months in Germany,
the reported cases increased by a factor five or more, whereas the death counts
hardly grew. This discrepancy fueled speculations that the rise of reported
cases would not reflect a second wave but only wider testing. We find that this
apparent discrepancy can be explained to a large extent by the age structure of
the infected, and predict a pronounced increase of death counts in the near
future, as the spread once again expands into older age groups. To re-establish
control, and to avoid the tipping point when TTI capacity is exceeded, case
numbers have to be lowered. Otherwise the control of the spread and the
protection of vulnerable people will require more restrictive measures latest
when the hospital capacity is reached.

Here, we introduce a meta-population model based on temporal networks,

granular spatial modelling of meta-population models with the ability to

a valuable framework to assess the viability of different NPIs, varying with

pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images
can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack
sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction

networks (CNN) need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the
task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires
time and resources which could further strain health care systems and
radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study,
we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects
images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal
and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the
unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available
COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia,
and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use
transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why
segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the
task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from
different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show
improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model

model mortality, and also provides different, and arguably a more realistic,

COVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling
the calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional
to infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with

the number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days

  to the COVID-19 pandemic","The dramatic outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics
and its ongoing progression boosted the scientific community's interest in
epidemic modeling and forecasting. The SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model
is a simple mathematical model of epidemic outbreaks, yet for decades it evaded
the efforts of the community to derive an explicit solution. The present work
demonstrates that this is a non-trivial task. Notably, it is proven that the
explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a new
transcendental special function, related to the Wright's Omega function. The
present manuscript reports new analytical results and numerical routines
suitable for parametric estimation of the SIR model. The manuscript introduces
iterative algorithms approximating the incidence variable, which allows for
estimation of the model parameters from the numbers of observed cases. The
numerical approach is exemplified with data from the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for several European countries in the

  Sequences with Transitional Genome Mapping","A method of transitional automorphic mapping of the genome on itself (TAMGI)
is aimed at combining detection and reconstruction of periodic motifs in the
genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The periodic motifs (whether tandem or sparse) are
assumed to be randomly modified by point mutations and indels during molecular
evolution and present in the genomes in a hidden form. TAMGI is robust with
respect to patched phasing of periodic motifs induced by indels. We developed
and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications.
The applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of hidden periodic
motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible
for the COVID-19 pandemia) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such
ribonucleocapsid is transported into spherical membrane envelope with
incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of
viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and
bacteriophage PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral
genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between
genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids
leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related
genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of
numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs
and complete repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans
regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.

can reduce its associated morbidity/mortality rate. Computational chemistry
approaches hold the potential for triaging potential candidates far more
quickly than their experimental counterparts. These methods have been widely
used to search for small molecules that can inhibit critical proteins involved
in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main
protease Mpro, an enzyme that cleaves the viral polyproteins into individual
proteins required for viral replication and transcription. Unfortunately,
standard computational screening methods face difficulties in ranking diverse
ligands to a receptor due to disparate ligand scaffolds and varying charge
states. Here, we describe full density functional quantum mechanical (DFT/QM)
simulations of Mpro in complex with various ligands to obtain absolute ligand
binding energies. Our calculations are enabled by a new cloud-native parallel
DFT/QM implementation running on computational resources from Amazon Web
Services (AWS). The results we obtain are promising: the approach is quite
capable of scoring a very diverse set of existing drug compounds for their
affinities to Mpro and suggest the DFT/QM approach is potentially more broadly
applicable to repurpose screening against this target. In addition, each DFT/QM
simulation required only ~1 hour (wall clock time) per ligand. The fast
turnaround time raises the practical possibility of a broad application of
large-scale quantum mechanics in the drug discovery pipeline at stages where
ligand diversity is essential.

approaches are just proposing variations of the activation function within the

research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum
approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive
design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum
principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the
proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation
functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in
TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated
extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and

a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets,
including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients
with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound
images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy
controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall
higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by

  chest X-ray images via novel Pinball-OCSVM","It is evident that the infection with this severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) starts with the upper respiratory tract and as the
virus grows, the infection can progress to lungs and develop pneumonia.
According to the statistics, approximately 14\% of the infected people with
COVID-19 have severe cough and shortness of breath due to pneumonia, because as
the viral infection increases, it damages the alveoli (small air sacs) and
surrounding tissues. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less sensitive
during early stages specially, if the patient is asymptomatic that may further
lead to more severe pneumonia. To overcome this problem an early diagnosis
method is proposed in this paper via one-class classification approach using a
novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine (PB-OCSVM)
considering posteroanterior chest X-ray images. Recently, several automated
COVID-19 diagnosis models have been proposed based on various deep learning
architectures to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest
X-ray (CXR) where the presence of less number of COVID-19 positive samples
compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis) raises the
challenge for unbiased learning in deep learning models that has been solved
using class balancing techniques which however should be avoided in any medical
diagnosis process. Inspired by this phenomenon, this article proposes a novel
PB-OCSVM model to work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples
with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency while minimize the
false-positive and false-negative predictions. The proposed model outperformed
over recently published deep learning approaches where accuracy, precision,
specificity and sensitivity are used as performance measure parameters.

regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation.
Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively
evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer,
and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar
segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input
to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using
hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The
proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using
semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images,
achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and
Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four
radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated
and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently
more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe
cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach
was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation
without requiring COVID-19 cases for training.

of COVID19-related misinformation, we release Covid-HeRA, a dataset for health
risk assessment of COVID-19-related social media posts. More specifically, we
study the severity of each misinformation story, i.e., how harmful a message

  Probabilistic Integrity Verification Inside Trusted Execution Environment","Machine learning models based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly
deployed in a wide range of applications ranging from self-driving cars to
COVID-19 treatment discovery. To support the computational power necessary to
learn a DNN, cloud environments with dedicated hardware support have emerged as
critical infrastructure. However, there are many integrity challenges
associated with outsourcing computation. Various approaches have been developed
to address these challenges, building on trusted execution environments (TEE).
Yet, no existing approach scales up to support realistic integrity-preserving
DNN model training for heavy workloads (deep architectures and millions of
training examples) without sustaining a significant performance hit. To
mitigate the time gap between pure TEE (full integrity) and pure GPU (no
integrity), we combine random verification of selected computation steps with
systematic adjustments of DNN hyper-parameters (e.g., a narrow gradient
clipping range), hence limiting the attacker's ability to shift the model
parameters significantly provided that the step is not selected for
verification during its training phase. Experimental results show the new
approach achieves 2X to 20X performance improvement over pure TEE based
solution while guaranteeing a very high probability of integrity (e.g., 0.999)
with respect to state-of-the-art DNN backdoor attacks.

  Application to COVID-19","As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, reliable prediction plays an important role
for policy making. The classical infectious disease model SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) is a compact yet simplistic temporal
model. The data-driven machine learning models such as RNN (recurrent neural
networks) can suffer in case of limited time series data such as COVID-19. In
this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid
spatio-temporal model to achieve both accuracy and efficiency in training and
forecasting. We introduce two features on the graph structure: node feature
(local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect).
For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR
so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge
feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and
regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective
and robust for prediction. The resulting hybrid model (called IeRNN) improves
the prediction accuracy on state-level COVID-19 new case data from the US,
out-performing standard temporal models (RNN, SEIR, and ARIMA) in 1-day and
7-day ahead forecasting. Our model accommodates various degrees of reopening

restored CT volumes are indistinguishable from healthy CT volumes by the
discriminator. GASNet is supervised by chest CT volumes of many healthy and

the healthcare, public safety, and economic systems when confronted with a
surge in patients that require intensive treatment and a population that must
be quarantined or shelter in place. The most obvious and pressing challenge is
taking care of acutely ill patients while managing spread of infection within
the care facility, but this is just the tip of the iceberg if we consider what
could be done to prepare in advance for future pandemics. Beyond the obvious
need for strengthening medical knowledge and preparedness, there is a
complementary need to anticipate and address the engineering challenges
associated with infectious disease emergencies. Robotic technologies are
inherently programmable, and robotic systems have been adapted and deployed, to
some extent, in the current crisis for such purposes as transport, logistics,
and disinfection. As technical capabilities advance and as the installed base
of robotic systems increases in the future, they could play a much more
significant role in future crises. This report is the outcome of a virtual
workshop co-hosted by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the
Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held on July 9-10, 2020. The workshop
consisted of over forty participants including representatives from the
engineering/robotics community, clinicians, critical care workers, public
health and safety experts, and emergency responders. It identifies key
challenges faced by healthcare responders and the general population and then
identifies robotic/technological responses to these challenges. Then it
identifies the key research/knowledge barriers that need to be addressed in
developing effective, scalable solutions. Finally, the report ends with the
following recommendations on how to implement this strategy.

dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date. The model
parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical
optimization. Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public

activities including the way people communicate, move, provision themselves, or

in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of the COVID-19
crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity,
mobility, and circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns
with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that
Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on
public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific
responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down
gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively,
while sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms tend to synchronize. In
particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the
lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tend to
restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to
avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the
lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts
return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent
population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on
behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is
reduced by one hour. We discuss the findings in the light of gender-specific
coping strategies in response to stress and crisis.

analysis for regional cluster modelling and analysis is essential in the
situations where there is significant multicollinearity among several
parameters, especially when the dimensionality of regional data is measured in
tens. The proposed principal components model allows for same-quality
representation of the clustering of regions. In fact, the clusters become more
distinctive and the apparent outliers become either more pronounced with the
component model clustering or are alleviated with the respective hierarchical
cluster. Thus, a five-component model was obtained and validated upon 85
regions of Russian Federation and 19 socio-economic parameters. The principal
components allowed to describe approximately 75 percent of the initial
parameters variation and enable further simulations upon the studied variables.
The cluster analysis upon the principal components modelling enabled better
exposure of regional structure and disparity in economic development in Russian
Federation, consisting of four main clusters: the few-numbered highest
development regions, the clusters with mid-to-high and low economic
development, and the ""poorest"" regions. It is observable that the development
in most regions relies upon resource economy, and the industrial potential as
well as inter-regional infrastructural potential are not realized to their
fullest, while only the wealthiest regions show highly developed economy, while
the industry in other regions shows signs of stagnation which is scaled further
due to the conditions entailed by economic sanctions and the recent Covid-19

industrial development, as their capital assets potential is hampered and,
while having sufficient labor resources, their donorship will increase.

characterize the changes observed to enable the detection of COVID-19 from

vocal fold oscillation patterns directly from recorded speech. Experimental

novel unsupervised task of identifying sentences containing key disinformation

statistical NLP solution for the task which starts with embedding sentences
within a bespoke feature space designed for the task. Sentences represented
using those features are then clustered, following which the key sentences are
identified through proximity scoring. We also curate a new dataset with
sentence level disinformation scorings to aid evaluation for this task; the
dataset is being made publicly available to facilitate further research. Based
on a comprehensive empirical evaluation against techniques from related tasks
such as claim detection and summarization, as well as against simplified
variants of our proposed approach, we illustrate that our method is able to
identify core disinformation effectively.

countries have gone through the lockdown process to reduce the health impact of
Covid-19. As countries have started lifting Covid-19 related restrictions,
businesses have been allowed to again have on-site customers. However, just a
limited number of people are being allowed on-site as long as social distancing
measures are being followed. This has resulted in heavy burdens on businesses
as their number of customers have decreased substantially. In this study, we
propose a model to minimize the economic impact of Covid-19 for businesses that
have implemented social distancing measures, as well as to minimize the health
impact of Covid-19 for their customers and employees. We introduce the quantity
Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and arrangement of
people at a given site while applying social distancing measures. We apply our
model to a real-world scenario and optimize the number of passengers and their
arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular
aircraft seat layouts using the Annealing Monte Carlo technique. We obtain the
optimal numbers and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family
groups and individual passengers for the social distancing measure. The
obtained optimal arrangements of passengers show complex patterns with groups
and individual passengers mixed in complex and non-trivial ways. This
demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its variants to find these
optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other arrangements of
passengers with the same number of passengers is a suboptimal arrangement with
higher health risks as a result of less distance between passengers. Our model
could be implemented for other social situations such as sports events,
theaters, medical centers, etc.

conditions. The detection of specific CXR findings has been the main focus of
several artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the wide range of
possible CXR abnormalities makes it impractical to build specific systems to
detect every possible condition. In this work, we developed and evaluated an AI
system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For development, we used a
de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in
India. To assess generalizability, we evaluated our system using 6
international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these
datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2
datasets with tuberculosis and 2 datasets with coronavirus disease 2019. Our
results suggest that the AI system generalizes to new patient populations and
abnormalities. In a simulated workflow where the AI system prioritized abnormal
cases, the turnaround time for abnormal cases reduced by 7-28%. These results
represent an important step towards evaluating whether AI can be safely used to
flag cases in a general setting where previously unseen abnormalities exist.

propose a robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of

findings also indicate that the reduction of infection and deaths by shortened

mitigation measures, such as social distancing and facial mask wearing, to
reduce the transmission rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level

quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection
process, which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals, and
prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings. It also does not make use of
observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical conditions, which could
be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions. In this paper, we use
a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator to develop and test
methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and proactively predict
an individual's infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based on their
contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy
constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to
the individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the
individual's contacts, who use this information to better predict their own
infectiousness, an approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). We find a
deep-learning based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average
mobility, suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave
prevention.

inevitably weaken the economy. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscores the
trade-off arising from public health and economic cost. An optimal lockdown
policy to resolve this trade-off is highly desired. Here we propose a
mathematical framework of pandemic control through an optimal non-uniform
lockdown, where our goal is to reduce the economic activity as little as
possible while decreasing the number of infected individuals at a prescribed
rate. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal lockdown
policy for general epidemic spread models, including both the classical
SIS/SIR/SEIR models and a new model of COVID-19 transmissions. We demonstrate
the power of this framework by analyzing publicly available data of
inter-county travel frequencies to analyze a model of COVID-19 spread in the 62
counties of New York State. We find that an optimal lockdown based on epidemic
status in April 2020 would have reduced economic activity more stringently
outside of New York City compared to within it, even though the epidemic was
much more prevalent in New York City at that point. Such a counterintuitive
result highlights the intricacies of pandemic control and sheds light on future
lockdown policy design.

  from Web Search Queries","COVID-19 has disrupted the global economy and well-being of people at an
unprecedented scale and magnitude. To contain the disease, an effective early
warning system that predicts the locations of outbreaks is of crucial
importance. Studies have shown the effectiveness of using large-scale mobility
data to monitor the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,
lockdowns) through population density analysis. However, predicting the
locations of potential outbreak occurrence is difficult using mobility data
alone. Meanwhile, web search queries have been shown to be good predictors of
the disease spread. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset of human
mobility trajectories (GPS traces) and web search queries with common user
identifiers (> 450K users), to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations beforehand.
More specifically, web search query analysis is conducted to identify users
with high risk of COVID-19 contraction, and social contact analysis was further
performed on the mobility patterns of these users to quantify the risk of an
outbreak. Our approach is empirically tested using data collected from users in
Tokyo, Japan. We show that by integrating COVID-19 related web search query
analytics with social contact networks, we are able to predict COVID-19 hotspot
locations 1-2 weeks beforehand, compared to just using social contact indexes
or web search data analysis. This study proposes a novel method that can be
used in early warning systems for disease outbreak hotspots, which can assist

assistive tools for faster diagnosis in addition to typical lab swab testing.
Chest X-Rays for COVID cases tend to show changes in the lungs such as ground
glass opacities and peripheral consolidations which can be detected by deep
neural networks. However, traditional convolutional networks use point estimate
for predictions, lacking in capture of uncertainty, which makes them less
reliable for adoption. There have been several works so far in predicting COVID
positive cases with chest X-Rays. However, not much has been explored on
quantifying the uncertainty of these predictions, interpreting uncertainty, and
decomposing this to model or data uncertainty. To address these needs, we
develop a visualization framework to address interpretability of uncertainty
and its components, with uncertainty in predictions computed with a Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Network. This framework aims to understand the
contribution of individual features in the Chest-X-Ray images to predictive
uncertainty. Providing this as an assistive tool can help the radiologist
understand why the model came up with a prediction and whether the regions of
interest captured by the model for the specific prediction are of significance
in diagnosis. We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool in chest x-ray
interpretation through several test cases from a benchmark dataset.

simulated by solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the
droplets are modelled as passive Lagrangian particles. Simulation results show
that the cloud of droplets locates around and below the waist height of the
manikin after two seconds from coughing, which indicates that kids walking
behind an infectious patient are exposed to higher transmission risk than
adults. More importantly, two distinct droplet dispersion modes occupying
significantly different contamination regions are discovered. A slight change
of space size is found being able to trigger the transition of dispersion modes
even though the flow patterns are still similar. This shows the importance of
accurately simulating the air flow in predicting the dispersion of viral
droplets and implies the necessity to set different safe-distancing guidelines
for different environments.

traditional blackboard lectures, including the gestures and the facial
expressions of the professor, are still a very efficient and highly appreciated
means of teaching mathematics, this paper deliberately does not want to propose
a novel pedagogical concept of how to teach mathematics, but rather presents a
technical concept how to preserve the quality of traditional blackboard
lectures even during the pandemic and how to make them available to the

mathematics is a dynamic creative process that requires the physical presence
of students in the lecture hall as audience so that the professor can
instantaneously fine-tune the evolution of the lecture according to his/her
perception of the level of attention and the facial expressions of the
students. The third assumption of this paper is that students need to have the
possibility to interact with each other personally. We report on the necessary

multiple sources such as COVID-19 confirmed and death case count data and
testing data for better predictions. To overcome the sparsity of training data
and to address the dynamic correlation of the disease, we propose
clustering-based training for high-resolution forecasting. The methods help us
to identify the similar trends of certain groups of regions due to various
spatio-temporal effects. We examine the proposed method for forecasting weekly
COVID-19 new confirmed cases at county-, state-, and country-level. A
comprehensive comparison between different time series models in COVID-19
context is conducted and analyzed. The results show that simple deep learning
models can achieve comparable or better performance when compared with more
complicated models. We are currently integrating our methods as a part of our
weekly forecasts that we provide state and federal authorities.

  Network Data","In this paper, our goal is to analyze and compare cellular network usage data
from pre-lockdown, during lockdown, and post-lockdown phases surrounding the
COVID-19 pandemic to understand and model human mobility patterns during the
pandemic, and evaluate the effect of lockdowns on mobility. To this end, we
collaborate with one of the main cellular network providers in Brazil, and
collect and analyze cellular network connections from 1400 antennas for all
users in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its suburbs from March 1, 2020 to July
1, 2020. Our analysis reveals that the total number of cellular connections
decreases to 78% during the lockdown phase and then increases to 85% of the
pre-COVID era as the lockdown eases. We observe that as more people work
remotely, there is a shift in the antennas incurring top 10% of the total
traffic, with the number of connections made to antennas in downtown Rio
reducing drastically and antennas at other locations taking their place. We
also observe that while nearly 40-45% users connected to only 1 antenna each
day during the lockdown phase indicating no mobility, there are around 4% users
(i.e., 80K users) who connected to more than 10 antennas, indicating very high
mobility. Finally, we design an interactive tool that showcases mobility
patterns in different granularities that can potentially help people and
government officials understand the mobility of individuals and the number of
COVID cases in a particular neighborhood. Our analysis, inferences, and
interactive showcasing of mobility patterns based on large-scale data can be
extrapolated to other cities of the world and has the potential to help in
designing more effective pandemic management measures in the future.

challenging to monitor, model, predict and contain. We address this scenario by
studying a variant of stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR)
model on arbitrary network instances using an analytical framework based on the
method of dynamic message-passing. This framework provides a good estimate of
the probabilistic evolution of the spread on both static and contact networks
at a low computational cost compared to numerical simulation. It facilitates
the derivation of epidemic thresholds, which are phase boundaries separating
parameter regimes where infections can be effectively contained from those
where they cannot. These have clear implications on different containment
strategies through topological (reducing contacts) and infection parameter
changes (e.g., social distancing and wearing face masks), with relevance to the
recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our studies show quantitatively the deficiency of
using the reproduction number as a measure for predicting the spreading rate in
some topologies, how effective isolation reduces the need in strict social
distancing measures, and the importance of mass testing in scenarios with long
asymptomatic exposure since isolation of symptomatic individuals is
insufficient to mitigate the spread.

  and Speaker Satisfaction","The (COVID-19) pandemic-induced restrictions on travel and social gatherings
have prompted most conference organizers to move their events online. However,
in contrast to physical conferences, virtual conferences face a challenge in
efficiently scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants
from different time-zones as well as their interests in attending different
talks. In such settings, a natural objective for the conference organizers
would be to maximize some global welfare measure, such as the total expected
audience participation across all talks. However, we show that optimizing for
global welfare could result in a schedule that is unfair to the stakeholders,
i.e., the individual utilities for participants and speakers can be highly
unequal. To address the fairness concerns, we formally define fairness notions
for participants and speakers, and subsequently derive suitable fairness
objectives for them. We show that the welfare and fairness objectives can be in
conflict with each other, and there is a need to maintain a balance between
these objective while caring for them simultaneously. Thus, we propose a joint
optimization framework that allows conference organizers to design talk
schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) between global welfare,
participant fairness and the speaker fairness objectives. We show that the
optimization problem can be solved using integer linear programming, and
empirically evaluate the necessity and benefits of such joint optimization
approach in virtual conference scheduling.

  Epidemiological and Social Media Data","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced public health experts to develop contingent
policies to stem the spread of infection, including measures such as
partial/complete lockdowns. The effectiveness of these policies has varied with
geography, population distribution, and effectiveness in implementation.
Consequently, some nations (e.g., Taiwan, Haiti) have been more successful than
others (e.g., United States) in curbing the outbreak. A data-driven
investigation into effective public health policies of a country would allow
public health experts in other nations to decide future courses of action to
control the outbreaks of disease and epidemics. We chose Spain and India to
present our analysis on regions that were similar in terms of certain factors:
(1) population density, (2) unemployment rate, (3) tourism, and (4) quality of
living. We posit that citizen ideology obtainable from twitter conversations
can provide insights into conformity to policy and suitably reflect on future
case predictions. A milestone when the curves show the number of new cases
diverging from each other is used to define a time period to extract
policy-related tweets while the concepts from a causality network of
policy-dependent sub-events are used to generate concept clouds. The number of
new cases is predicted using sentiment scores in a regression model. We see
that the new case predictions reflects twitter sentiment, meaningfully tied to
a trigger sub-event that enables policy-related findings for Spain and India to
be effectively compared.

identical entities (events, people, locations, etc.). Using hundreds of
thousands of data samples, a 2.8% increase in polarization was measured during
times of crisis compared to times where no crises were occurring. Regardless of
the reasoning that the gap between political parties can increase so much
during times of suffering and stress, it is definitely alarming to see that
among other aspects of life, the partisan gap worsens during detrimental

to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of

methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related
hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories,
namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures,
5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope}, and study the temporal evolution of
tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to
all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief
concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets
as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our
investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and
negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying.
We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the
action words and then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze
the context of action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as
anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic
modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag
groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping
similar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to
construct an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays
the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.

trade losses during the first eight months of the pandemic. Our results show
widespread trade losses on a port level with the largest absolute losses found
for ports in China, the Middle-East and Western Europe, associated with the
collapse of specific supply-chains (e.g. oil, vehicle manufacturing). In total,
we estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0% to -9.6% during the
first eight months of 2020, which is equal to around 206-286 million tonnes in
volume losses and up to 225-412 billion USD in value losses. The fishery,
mining and quarrying, electrical equipment and machinery manufacturing, and
transport equipment manufacturing sectors are hit hardest, with losses up to
11.8%. Moreover, we find a large geographical disparity in losses, with some
small islands developing states and low-income economies suffering the largest
relative trade losses. We find a clear negative impact of COVID-19 related
business and public transport closures on country-wide exports. Overall, we
show how real-time indicators of economic activity can support governments and
international organisations in economic recovery efforts and allocate funds to

  Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans","The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally
spreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of
its first emergence in late 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown
distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests,
in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms
are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify
COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation
and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image
instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend
slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding
mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the
disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based
framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the
""COVID-FACT"". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks
and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to
make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the
area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first
stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID
and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies
positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19,
community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments,
COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a
specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while
depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its
counterparts.

  Disease Identification from Chest CT Scans using Capsule Networks","The global outbreak of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) disease has
drastically impacted the world and led to one of the most challenging crisis
across the globe since World War II. The early diagnosis and isolation of
COVID-19 positive cases are considered as crucial steps towards preventing the
spread of the disease and flattening the epidemic curve. Chest Computed
Tomography (CT) scan is a highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic
technique that can complement Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) test. Recently, deep learning-based models, mostly based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have shown promising diagnostic results.
CNNs, however, are incapable of capturing spatial relations between image
instances and require large datasets. Capsule Networks, on the other hand, can
capture spatial relations, require smaller datasets, and have considerably
fewer parameters. In this paper, a Capsule network framework, referred to as
the ""CT-CAPS"", is presented to automatically extract distinctive features of
chest CT scans. These features, which are extracted from the layer before the
final capsule layer, are then leveraged to differentiate COVID-19 from
Non-COVID cases. The experiments on our in-house dataset of 307 patients show
the state-of-the-art performance with the accuracy of 90.8%, sensitivity of
94.5%, and specificity of 86.0%.

understanding of the virus. A comparison of environmental features related to
the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with those of its potential hosts is critical. We
examine the distribution of coronaviruses among bats. We analyse the
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in a nine-week period following lockdown in Italy,
Spain, and Australia. We correlate its incidence with environmental variables
particularly ultraviolet radiation, temperature, and humidity. We establish a
clear negative relationship between COVID-19 and ultraviolet radiation,
modulated by temperature and humidity. We relate our results with data showing
that the bat species most vulnerable to coronavirus infection are those which
live in environmental conditions that are similar to those that appear to be
most favourable to the spread of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 ecological niche has
been the product of long-term coevolution of coronaviruses with their host
species. Understanding the key parameters of that niche in host species allows
us to predict circumstances where its spread will be most favourable. Such
conditions can be summarised under the headings of nocturnality and
seasonality. High ultraviolet radiation, in particular, is proposed as a key
limiting variable. We therefore expect the risk of spread of COVID-19 to be
highest in winter conditions, and in low light environments. Human activities
resembling those of highly social cave-dwelling bats (e.g. large nocturnal
gatherings or high density indoor activities) will only serve to compound the
problem of COVID-19.

  COVID-19 deconfinement strategy","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses a great threat to public health and
the economy worldwide. Currently, COVID-19 evolves in many countries to a
second stage, characterized by the need for the liberation of the economy and
relaxation of the human psychological effects. To this end, numerous countries
decided to implement adequate deconfinement strategies. After the first
prolongation of the established confinement, Morocco moves to the deconfinement
stage on May 20, 2020. The relevant question concerns the impact on the
COVID-19 propagation by considering an additional degree of realism related to
stochastic noises due to the effectiveness level of the adapted measures. In
this paper, we propose a delayed stochastic mathematical model to predict the
epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco after the deconfinement. To ensure
the well-posedness of the model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a
positive solution. Based on the large number theorem for martingales, we
discuss the extinction of the disease under an appropriate threshold parameter.
Moreover, numerical simulations are performed in order to test the efficiency
of the deconfinement strategies chosen by the Moroccan authorities to help the
policy makers and public health administration to make suitable decisions in
the near future.

one of the key symptoms. Studies show that in these cases, voice production is
also adversely affected -- vocal fold oscillations are asynchronous,
asymmetrical and more restricted during phonation. This paper proposes a method
that analyzes the differential dynamics of the glottal flow waveform (GFW)
during voice production to identify features in them that are most significant
for the detection of COVID-19 from voice. Since it is hard to measure this
directly in COVID-19 patients, we infer it from recorded speech signals and
compare it to the GFW computed from physical model of phonation. For normal
voices, the difference between the two should be minimal, since physical models
are constructed to explain phonation under assumptions of normalcy. Greater
differences implicate anomalies in the bio-physical factors that contribute to
the correctness of the physical model, revealing their significance indirectly.
Our proposed method uses a CNN-based 2-step attention model that locates
anomalies in time-feature space in the difference of the two GFWs, allowing us
to infer their potential as discriminative features for classification. The
viability of this method is demonstrated using a clinically curated dataset of
COVID-19 positive and negative subjects.

  particulates for intranasal targeting of SARS-CoV-2 infection sites","Efficacy for COVID-19 treatments can be enhanced significantly through
targeting the nasopharynx, which has been shown to be the dominant preliminary
infection site for SARS-CoV-2. Although intranasal drugs can be administered
easily through drops or sprays, it is difficult to test whether current
protocols will deliver the right amount of the drug to this location
consistently. We are interested in developing an in silico prototyping tool to
rapidly identify optimal parameters for intranasal delivery. In this study, we
have applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate fluid flow through the
nasal cavity and examined particle deposition for a drug formulation, mimicking
different delivery methods. The nasal geometry models were derived using
digitized and meshed computed tomography (CT) scans of human patients. Using
the nasal geometries, we simulated two different airflows: a laminar model at
15 LPM (Liters/min) that simulated resting breathing rate and a Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) model used to achieve a higher flow rate of 30 LPM. We were
able to run particle tracking simulations for these two airflow schemes to test
different drug properties such as particle size. The different injection
methods used include surface injection which best replicates an inhaler-based
release of particle droplets into the nostril and the cone injection method
which best replicates a spray into the nostril. The results of the study
suggest that the most optimal drug particle size for targeting the intranasal
infection sites is around 6-14 microns.

implemented to slow its spread. Many of these difficulties are fundamentally
information needs; attempts to address these needs have caused an information
overload for both researchers and the public. Natural language processing
(NLP), the branch of artificial intelligence that interprets human language,
can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more
than 50 systems and datasets addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We detail work
on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.

caused widespread economic and social impact worldwide. Across the globe,
governments have put mandates for the use of face masks, which have received
both positive and negative reaction. Online social media provides an exciting
platform to study the use of masks and analyze underlying mask-wearing
patterns. In this article, we analyze 2.04 million social media images for six
US cities. An increase in masks worn in images is seen as the COVID-19 cases
rose, particularly when their respective states imposed strict regulations. We
also found a decrease in the posting of group pictures as stay-at-home laws
were put into place. Furthermore, mask compliance in the Black Lives Matter
protest was analyzed, eliciting that 40% of the people in group photos wore
masks, and 45% of them wore the masks with a fit score of greater than 80%. We
introduce two new datasets, VAriety MAsks - Classification (VAMA-C) and VAriety
MAsks - Segmentation (VAMA-S), for mask detection and mask fit analysis tasks,
respectively. For the analysis, we create two frameworks, face mask detector
(for classifying masked and unmasked faces) and mask fit analyzer (a semantic
segmentation based model to calculate a mask-fit score). The face mask detector
achieved a classification accuracy of 98%, and the semantic segmentation model
for the mask fit analyzer achieved an Intersection Over Union (IOU) score of
98%. We conclude that such a framework can be used to evaluate the
effectiveness of such public health strategies using social media platforms in

  devices for patients with COVID-19","In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a global pandemic of the new human
coronavirus disease COVID-19. This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory
system of the afflicted, usually resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of
acute respiratory distress syndrome. These disease developments result in the
formation of different pathological structures in the lungs, similar to those
observed in other viral pneumonias that can be detected by the use of chest
X-rays. For this reason, the detection and analysis of the pulmonary regions,
the main focus of affection of COVID-19, becomes a crucial part of both
clinical and automatic diagnosis processes. Due to the overload of the health
services, portable X-ray devices are widely used, representing an alternative
to fixed devices to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. However, these
devices entail different complications as the image quality that, together with
the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult.
In this work, we developed a novel fully automatic methodology specially
designed for the identification of these lung regions in X-ray images of low
quality as those from portable devices. To do so, we took advantage of a large
dataset from magnetic resonance imaging of a similar pathology and performed
two stages of transfer learning to obtain a robust methodology with a low
number of images from portable X-ray devices. This way, our methodology
obtained a satisfactory accuracy of $0.9761 \pm 0.0100$ for patients with
COVID-19, $0.9801 \pm 0.0104$ for normal patients and $0.9769 \pm 0.0111$ for
patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such
as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.

difficult to compute if the number of infected individuals is large. We develop
an approximation for the transition probability based on central limit theorem

  Corridors during COVID-19","Aspirations to slow down the spread of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) resulted
in unprecedented restrictions on personal and work-related travels in various
nations across the globe. As a consequence, economic activities within and
across the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities
start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes
critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing
pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the
commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by
combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment
with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the
proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and
across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many
SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing
the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health
vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks
due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while
the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's
districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the
overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into
choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political
decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states
while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to
transit-time related risks.

from a similar experimental perspective: What ideal experiment would we design
to estimate the causal effects of spatial treatments? This perspective
motivates a comparison between individuals near realized treatment locations
and individuals near unrealized candidate locations, which is distinct from
current empirical practice. Furthermore, I show how to find such candidate

  Prediction of COVID-19","A system to model the spread of COVID-19 cases after lockdown has been
proposed, to define new preventive measures based on hotspots, using the graph

less prone to the virus spread. There exist methods to model the spread of the
virus, by predicting the number of confirmed cases. But the proposed system
focuses more on the preventive side of the solution from a geographical point
of view, by predicting the areas or regions that may become hotspots for the
virus in the near future. The fact that the virus can only be transmitted by
being in close proximity to an already infected person, suggests that, the
regions that can easily be reached from an existing hotspot, have a higher
chance of becoming a new hotspot. Moreover, in smaller regions, even after
strict provisions, positive cases have been found. To consider this fact, the
geographic distance between the nearest hotspots can be used as a measure of
likelihood of the region also becoming a hotspot. In this paper, a weighted
graph of regions with the regions themselves as weighted nodes with weight of
the nodes as the number of active cases and the distance as edge weights. The
graph can be completely connected or connected based on a distance threshold.
The nodes are the administrative, and the distance measure tells the possible
transmission between separate communities. Using this data, the potential
regions that can become hotspots can be predicted, and preventive measures can
be devised.

(2)What effects have these changes had on Internet performance?; (3)How did

downstream peak volumes for a major ISP increase of 13-20% while upstream peaks
increased by more than 30%. Further, we observe significant variation in
performance across ISPs in conjunction with the traffic volume shifts, with
evident latency increases after stay-at-home orders were issued, followed by a
stabilization of traffic after April. Finally, we observe that in response to
changes in usage, ISPs have aggressively augmented capacity at interconnects,
at more than twice the rate of normal capacity augmentation. Similarly, video

  Hierarchical Convolutional Networks","The current COVID-19 pandemic has motivated the researchers to use artificial
intelligence techniques for a potential alternative to reverse

testing. The chest X-ray (CXR) is one of the alternatives to achieve fast
diagnosis but the unavailability of large-scale annotated data makes the
clinical implementation of machine learning-based COVID detection difficult.
Another issue is the usage of ImageNet pre-trained networks which does not
extract reliable feature representations from medical images. In this paper, we
propose the use of hierarchical convolutional network (HCN) architecture to
naturally augment the data along with diversified features. The HCN uses the
first convolution layer from COVIDNet followed by the convolutional layers from
well-known pre-trained networks to extract the features. The use of the
convolution layer from COVIDNet ensures the extraction of representations
relevant to the CXR modality. We also propose the use of ECOC for encoding
multiclass problems to binary classification for improving the recognition
performance. Experimental results show that HCN architecture is capable of
achieving better results in comparison to the existing studies. The proposed
method can accurately triage potential COVID-19 patients through CXR images for
sharing the testing load and increasing the testing capacity.

million Californians to stay at home in the coming weeks as the result of the
escalation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As lockdowns
were implemented, the significant changes caused by these restrictions brought
a dramatic improvement in air quality in metropolitan cities such as Los
Angeles (LA Basin).Methods: We use real-time data from The South Coast Air
Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD), and the California Department
of Transportation to evaluate the drivers of the pollution sources. We also
mapped monthly spatial variations and constructed hourly heatmaps of those
pollutants in 2020 to understand the impacts of the lockdown on different
locations and times of day in the LA Basin. Results: Compared to the same dates
in 2019, traffic flow on highways in the Los Angeles Basin dropped by 20.86 %
when the stay at home order was initiated and it continued to decrease along
with dramatic declines in NO2, CO, and PM2.5. The correlation (Pierson r)
between truck flow change and changes of NO2, CO, and PM2.5 is statistically
significant. Conclusion: The declines in truck flow are mainly responsible for
the drop of NO2 and CO, with traffic having a slightly smaller effect on PM2.5.
The lockdowns provided a large-scale experiment into air quality research. The
result of this research would provide an important reference for the policy
markers regarding truck management in light of air quality control to prepare

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had already resulted in more
than thirty-two million cases infected and more than one million deaths
worldwide.
  Given the fact that the pandemic is still threatening health and safety, it
is in the urgency to understand the COVID-19 contagion process and know how it
might be controlled. With this motivation in mind, in this paper, we consider a
version of a stochastic discrete-time
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Death~(SIRD)-based epidemiological model with
two uncertainties: The uncertain rate of infected cases which are undetected or
asymptomatic, and the uncertain effectiveness rate of control. Our aim is to
study the effect of an epidemic control policy on the uncertain model in a
control-theoretic framework. We begin by providing the closed-form solutions of
states in the modified SIRD-based model such as infected cases, susceptible
cases, recovered cases, and deceased cases. Then, the corresponding expected
states and the technical lower and upper bounds for those states are provided
as well. Subsequently, we consider two epidemic control problems to be
addressed: One is almost sure epidemic control problem and the other average
epidemic control problem. Having defined the two problems, our main results are
a set of sufficient conditions on a class of linear control policy which
assures that the epidemic is ""well-controlled""; i.e., both of the infected
cases and deceased cases are upper bounded uniformly and the number of infected
cases converges to zero asymptotically. Our numerical studies, using the
historical COVID-19 contagion data in the United States, suggest that our
appealingly simple model and control framework can provide a reasonable
epidemic control performance compared to the ongoing pandemic situation.

they cause infectious diseases which can lead to epidemics. Recent coronavirus
disease 2019 epidemic has shown that taking effective prevention measures such
as wearing masks are important to reduce the human deaths and side effects of
the epidemic. It is therefore requisite to accurately model the spread of
infectious diseases whose one of the most crucial routes of transmission is
airborne transmission. The transmission models in the literature are proposed
independently from each other, at different scales and by the researchers from
various disciplines. Thus, there is a need to merge all these research
attempts. To this end, we propose a communication engineering approach that
melts different disciplines such as epidemiology, biology, medicine, and fluid
dynamics in the same pot to model airborne pathogen transmission among humans.
In this approach, we introduce the concept of mobile human ad hoc networks
(MoHANETs). This concept exploits the similarity of airborne
transmission-driven human groups with mobile ad hoc networks and uses molecular
communication as the enabling paradigm. The aim of this article is to present a
unified framework using communication engineering, and to highlight future
research directions for modeling the spread of infectious diseases among humans
through airborne pathogen transmission. In this article, we first review the
airborne pathogen transmission mechanisms. Then, the MoHANET is given with a
layered structure. In these layers, the infectious human emitting
pathogen-laden droplets through air and the exposed human to these droplets are
considered as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Moreover, the
experimental methods for the proposed approach are reviewed and discussed.

  COVID-19 spread accounting for long-term care facilities","We propose a high dimensional Bayesian inference framework for learning
heterogeneous dynamics of a COVID-19 model, with a specific application to the
dynamics and severity of COVID-19 inside and outside long-term care (LTC)
facilities. We develop a heterogeneous compartmental model that accounts for
the heterogeneity of the time-varying spread and severity of COVID-19 inside
and outside LTC facilities, which is characterized by time-dependent stochastic
processes and time-independent parameters in $\sim$1500 dimensions after
discretization. To infer these parameters, we use reported data on the number
of confirmed, hospitalized, and deceased cases with suitable post-processing in
both a deterministic inversion approach with appropriate regularization as a
first step, followed by Bayesian inversion with proper prior distributions. To
address the curse of dimensionality and the ill-posedness of the
high-dimensional inference problem, we propose use of a dimension-independent
projected Stein variational gradient descent method, and demonstrate the
intrinsic low-dimensionality of the inverse problem. We present inference
results with quantified uncertainties for both New Jersey and Texas, which
experienced different epidemic phases and patterns. Moreover, we also present
forecasting and validation results based on the empirical posterior samples of
our inference for the future trajectory of COVID-19.

decades to the health and economic welfare of populations globally. In this
paper, we analyze different types of policy measures designed to fight the
spread of the virus and minimize economic losses. Our analysis builds on a
multi-group SEIR model, which extends the multi-group SIR model introduced by
Acemoglu et al.~(2020). We adjust the underlying social interaction patterns
and consider an extended set of policy measures. The model is calibrated for
Germany. Despite the trade-off between COVID-19 prevention and economic
activity that is inherent to shielding policies, our results show that
efficiency gains can be achieved by targeting such policies towards different
age groups. Alternative policies such as physical distancing can be employed to
reduce the degree of targeting and the intensity and duration of shielding. Our
results show that a comprehensive approach that combines multiple policy
measures simultaneously can effectively mitigate population mortality and
economic harm.

COVID-19 pandemic, these containment measures are associated with an economic
burden. In this work, we propose a network approach to model the implementation

partitions. Our model is composed by two main ingredients: a multiplex network
representing human contacts within different contexts, formed by a Household
layer, a Work layer, and a third Social layer including generic social
interactions, and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process that mimics the
epidemic spreading. We compare different partition strategies, with a twofold
aim: reducing the epidemic outbreak and minimizing the economic cost associated
to the partial lockdown. We also show that the inclusion of unconstrained
social interactions dramatically increases the epidemic spreading, while
different kinds of restrictions on social interactions help in keeping the
benefices of the network partition.

the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We investigate the air-puff tonometry,
which uses a short-timed air-puff to applanate the human eye in a bid to detect
the early onset of glaucoma by measuring the intraocular pressure. The air-puff
consists of a vortex trailed by a high-speed jet. High-speed imaging of the eye
during a typical tonometry measurement reveals a sequence of events starting
with the interaction between the tear layer and the air puff leading to an
initial sheet ejection. It is immediately followed by the trailing jet
applanating the central corneal section, causing capillary waves to form and
interact with the highly 3D transient expanding sheet. Such interaction with
the capillary waves and the surrounding airfield due to the trailing jet causes
the expanding sheet to undergo bag breakup, finger formation by Rayleigh Taylor
instability and further break up into subsequent droplets by Rayleigh Plateau
instability, which eventually splashes onto nearby objects, potentially forming
fomites or aerosols which can lead to infections. The complex spatiotemporal
phenomenon is carefully documented by rigorous experiments and corroborated
using comprehensive theoretical analyses.

First, we consider the design of a social sensing system whose objective is the

onset of an epidemic outbreak as fast as possible. We pose this problem as a
hitting time probability maximization problem and use submodularity
optimization techniques to derive explicit quality guarantees for the proposed
solution. Second, once an epidemic outbreak has been detected, we consider the
problem of adaptively distributing viral tests over time in order to maximize
the information gained about the current state of the epidemic. We formalize
this problem in terms of information entropy and mutual information and propose
an adaptive allocation strategy with quality guarantees. For these problems, we
derive analytical solutions for any stochastic compartmental epidemic model
with Markovian dynamics, as well as efficient Monte-Carlo-based algorithms for
non-Markovian dynamics. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed
framework in numerical experiments involving a model of Covid-19 applied to a

over the world. As one of the efficient solutions, mechanical
harvest/auto-harvest that is based on object detection and robotic harvester
becomes an urgent need. Within the auto-harvest system, robust few-shot object
detection model is one of the bottlenecks, since the system is required to deal
with new vegetable/fruit categories and the collection of large-scale annotated
datasets for all the novel categories is expensive. There are many few-shot
object detection models that were developed by the community. Yet whether they
could be employed directly for real life agricultural applications is still
questionable, as there is a context-gap between the commonly used training
datasets and the images collected in real life agricultural scenarios. To this
end, in this study, we present a novel cucumber dataset and propose two data
augmentation strategies that help to bridge the context-gap. Experimental
results show that 1) the state-of-the-art few-shot object detection model
performs poorly on the novel `cucumber' category; and 2) the proposed
augmentation strategies outperform the commonly used ones.

  Prevention Strategies","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 spreading, the number of studies on the
epidemic models increased dramatically. It is important for policy makers to
know how the disease will spread, and what are the effects of the policies and
environment on the spreading. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the
standard infectious disease models: (a) We consider the prevention measures
adopted based on the current severity of the infection, those measures are
adaptive and change over time. (b) Multiple cities and regions are considered,
with population movements between those cities/regions, while taking into
account that each region may have different prevention measures. While the
adaptive measures and mobility of the population were often observed during the
pandemic, these effects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the
classical epidemic models. The model we propose gives rise to a plateau
phenomenon: the number of people infected by the disease stay at the same level
during an extended period of time. We show what are conditions needs to be met
in order for the spreading to exhibit a plateau period, and we show that this
phenomenon is interdependent: when considering multiples cities, the conditions
are different from a single city. We verify from the real-world data that
plateau phenomenon does exists in many regions of the world in the current
COVID-19 development. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis on the plateau
phenomenon for the single-city model, and derive a series of results on the
emergence and ending of the plateau, and on the height and length of the
plateau. Our theoretical results match well with our empirical findings.

life and unprecedented economical loss throughout the world. Social distancing
and face masks are widely recommended around the globe in order to protect
others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and
sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we
carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of
unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of
saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks.
Our simulations: (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow
(indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor); (b) incorporate the effect
of human anatomy on the flow; (c) account for both medical and non-medical
grade masks; and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging
from 10 micro m to 300 micro m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva
particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with
medical-grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus,
in indoor environments either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can
successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under
outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow
through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the
energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large
distances by the turbulent flow, thus, limiting the effectiveness of facial
masks.

  Stress from COVID-19","When facing an extreme stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare
systems typically respond reactively by creating surge capacity at facilities
that are at or approaching their baseline capacity. However, creating
individual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach,
and redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce
the total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly
distributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to
create surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is
this inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at
over-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal
demand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and
resource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze
a series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of
the demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand
uncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also
incorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers
may need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated
retrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and
Miami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative
to the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are
operationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In
summary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a
practical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly
care for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.

increased. Recent research has shown radiography of COVID-19 patient, such as
CT and X-ray, contains salient information about the COVID-19 virus and could
be used as an alternative diagnosis method. Chest X-ray (CXR) due to its faster
imaging time, wide availability, low cost and portability gains much attention
and becomes very promising. Computational methods with high accuracy and
robustness are required for rapid triaging of patients and aiding radiologist

  COVID-19 Outbreak","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive number of attempts on the predictions
of the number of cases and the other future trends of this pandemic have been
made. However, they fail to predict, in a reliable way, the medium and long
term evolution of fundamental features of COVID-19 outbreak within acceptable
accuracy. This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning
models in this particular forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple
linear regression models provide high prediction accuracy values reliably but
only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning models,
which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors,
cannot achieve to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization
ability. It is suggested in the paper that the lack of a sufficient number of
samples is the source of low prediction performance of the forecasting models.
The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is measured
in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as
expectations for the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the
information, which is of most relevant with the active cases, we perform
feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different feature
selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature
Selection, and feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them
to each other and also with the models not employing any feature selection.
Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and
Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases
together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that
the accurate forecasting of the active cases with high generalization ability
is possible up to 3 days only because of the small sample size of COVID-19

temporally updated overview of the current state of the pandemics, making
public health interventions to be more effective. Moreover, the use of
spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context,

between muscular contraction in the thorax, elasto-capillary interactions in
individual lung branches, propagation of air between different connected
branches, and overall air flow into the lungs. These processes occur over
considerably different length and time scales; consequently, linking them to
the biomechanical properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together
control the spatiotemporal features of inhalation, remains a challenge. We
address this challenge by developing a computational model of the lungs as a
hierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders
coupled to a viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a
pressure that is determined by input biomechanical parameters, enabling us to
test the influence of changes in the mechanical properties of lung tissues and
secretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches,
we quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during
inhalation, reproducing the shape of measured breathing curves. Using this
model, we demonstrate how changes in lung muscle contraction, mucus viscosity
and surface tension, and airway wall stiffness---characteristic of many
respiratory diseases, including those arising from COVID-19, cystic fibrosis,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and emphysema---drastically
alter inhaled lung capacity and breathing duration. Our work therefore helps to
identify the key factors that control breathing dynamics, and provides a way to

studying a heterogeneous bond percolation process over a multi-type network

  in Crowds","Digital contact tracing is being used by many countries to help contain
COVID-19's spread in a post-lockdown world. Among the various available
techniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal
strength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered less of a privacy
risk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS,
cellular-tower history, or QR-code scanning. As of October 2020, there have
been millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contract-tracing apps, as
more and more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of
these apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical
research that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to
fill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of
Bluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80
participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world
gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting
proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially
crowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in
need, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover,
technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused
by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users'
willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still
be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity
of up to 20m lasting for an hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that
existing contact-tracing apps can be re-purposed to focus on coarse-grained
proximity detection, and that future ones calibrate distance estimates and
adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.

significant, fact checks could have limited visibility and may not reach the
intended audience, such as those deeply embedded in polarized communities.
Concerned citizens (i.e., the crowd), who are users of the platforms where
misinformation appears, can play a crucial role in disseminating fact-checking
information and in countering the spread of misinformation. To explore if this
is the case, we conduct a data-driven study of misinformation on the Twitter
platform, focusing on tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the
spread of misinformation, professional fact checks, and the crowd response to
popular misleading claims about COVID-19. In this work, we curate a dataset of
false claims and statements that seek to challenge or refute them. We train a
classifier to create a novel dataset of 155,468 COVID-19-related tweets,
containing 33,237 false claims and 33,413 refuting arguments.Our findings show
that professional fact-checking tweets have limited volume and reach. In
contrast, we observe that the surge in misinformation tweets results in a quick
response and a corresponding increase in tweets that refute such
misinformation. More importantly, we find contrasting differences in the way
the crowd refutes tweets, some tweets appear to be opinions, while others
contain concrete evidence, such as a link to a reputed source. Our work
provides insights into how misinformation is organically countered in social
platforms by some of their users and the role they play in amplifying
professional fact checks.These insights could lead to development of tools and
mechanisms that can empower concerned citizens in combating misinformation. The

  Artificial Intelligence algorithms and multi-sources Data Processing","Aim of this paper is the description of a new tool to support institutions in
the implementation of targeted countermeasures, based on quantitative and
multi-scale elements, for the fight and prevention of emergencies, such as the
current COVID-19 pandemic. The tool is a centralized system (web application),
single multi-user platform, which relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms for the processing of heterogeneous data, and which can produce an
output level of risk. The model includes a specific neural network which will
be first trained to learn the correlation between selected inputs, related to
the case of interest: environmental variables (chemical-physical, such as
meteorological), human activity (such as traffic and crowding), level of
pollution (in particular the concentration of particulate matter), and
epidemiological variables related to the evolution of the contagion. The tool
realized in the first phase of the project will serve later both as a decision
support system (DSS) with predictive capacity, when fed by the actual measured
data, and as a simulation bench performing the tuning of certain input values,
to identify which of them lead to a decrease in the degree of risk. In this
way, the authors aim to design different scenarios to compare different
restrictive strategies and the actual expected benefits, to adopt measures
sized to the actual need, and adapted to the specific areas of analysis, useful
to safeguard human health, but also the economic and social impact of the
choices.

  longitudinal data","To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, governments across the world
implemented extraordinary physical distancing policies, such as stay-at-home
orders, and numerous studies aim to estimate their effects. Many statistical
and econometric methods, such as difference-in-differences, leverage repeated
measurements and variation in timing to estimate policy effects, including in
the COVID-19 context. While these methods are less common in epidemiology,
epidemiologic researchers are well accustomed to handling similar complexities
in studies of individual-level interventions. ""Target trial emulation""
emphasizes the need to carefully design a non-experimental study in terms of
inclusion and exclusion criteria, covariates, exposure definition, and outcome
measurement -- and the timing of those variables. We argue that policy
evaluations using group-level longitudinal (""panel"") data need to take a
similar careful approach to study design, which we refer to as ""policy trial
emulation."" This is especially important when intervention timing varies across
jurisdictions; the main idea is to construct target trials separately for each
""treatment cohort"" (states that implement the policy at the same time) and then
aggregate. We present a stylized analysis of the impact of state-level
stay-at-home orders on total coronavirus cases. We argue that estimates from
panel methods -- with the right data and careful modeling and diagnostics --
can help add to our understanding of many policies, though doing so is often
challenging.

However, the gains from higher caste homogeneity are seen to erode with the

prioritize public health interventions in caste-wise heterogeneous areas to
compensate for the absence of community cohesion. The importance of our study

that the COVID-19 vanishes from the people if $\xi <1;$ whereas control the

State of Paraiba, and in the City of Campina Grande). We prove the well
posedness and the continuous dependence of the model dynamics on its

the active cases that is instrumental for the automatic estimation of
parameters of the epidemiological model. We obtained statistical estimates of
the active cases based the probabilistic method and on the confirmed cases

rate, which reflects a lower or higher adherence to social distancing by the
involved populations. By also analysing the data on daily deaths, we obtained
the daily lethality and recovery rates. We then integrate the equations of
motion of the model using these time-dependent parameters. We validate our
epidemiological model by fitting the official data of confirmed, recovered,
death, and active cases due to the pandemic with the theoretical predictions.
We obtained very good fits of the data with this method. The automated
procedure developed here could be used for basically any population with a
minimum of extra work. Finally, we also propose and validate a forecasting
method based on Markov chains for the evolution of the epidemiological data for
up to two weeks.

  Practices during COVID-19 Pandemic in Public Open Spaces","Coronavirus has been spreading around the world since the end of 2019. The
virus can cause acute respiratory syndrome, which can be lethal, and is easily
transmitted between hosts. Most states have issued state-at-home executive
orders, however, parks and other public open spaces have largely remained open
and are seeing sharp increases in public use. Therefore, in order to ensure
public safety, it is imperative for patrons of public open spaces to practice
safe hygiene and take preventative measures. This work provides a scalable
sensing approach to detect physical activities within public open spaces and
monitor adherence to social distancing guidelines suggested by the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A deep learning-based computer vision
sensing framework is designed to investigate the careful and proper utilization
of parks and park facilities with hard surfaces (e.g. benches, fence poles, and
trash cans) using video feeds from a pre-installed surveillance camera network.
The sensing framework consists of a CNN-based object detector, a multi-target
tracker, a mapping module, and a group reasoning module. The experiments are
carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and May 2020 across
several key locations at the Detroit Riverfront Parks in Detroit, Michigan. The
sensing framework is validated by comparing automatic sensing results with
manually labeled ground-truth results. The proposed approach significantly
improves the efficiency of providing spatial and temporal statistics of users
in public open spaces by creating straightforward data visualizations for
federal and state agencies. The results can also provide on-time triggering
information for an alarming or actuator system which can later be added to
intervene inappropriate behavior during this pandemic.

non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, respect for autonomy, liberty, and

all are relevant to the education context. The essay provides ethical
considerations that educational institutions will need to carefully review
before electing to deploy and govern specific online proctoring technologies.

develop and deploy smartphone apps to expedite contact tracing and risk
notification. Most of these apps track pairwise encounters between individuals
via Bluetooth and then use these tracked encounters to identify and notify
those who might have been in proximity of a contagious individual.
Unfortunately, these apps have not yet proven sufficiently effective, partly
owing to low adoption rates, but also due to the difficult tradeoff between
utility and privacy and the fact that, in COVID-19, most individuals do not
infect anyone but a few superspreaders infect many in superspreading events. In
this paper, we proposePanCast, a privacy-preserving and inclusive system for
epidemic risk assessment and notification that scales gracefully with adoption
rates, utilizes location and environmental information to increase utility
without tracking its users, and can be used to identify superspreading events.
To this end, rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones, our
system utilizes Bluetooth encounters between beacons placed in strategic
locations where superspreading events are most likely to occur and inexpensive,
zero-maintenance, small devices that users can attach to their keyring. PanCast
allows healthy individuals to use the system in a purely passive ""radio"" mode,
and can assist and benefit from other digital and manual contact tracing
systems. Finally, PanCast can be gracefully dismantled at the end of the
pandemic, minimizing abuse from any malevolent government or entity.

cluster these questions depending on their topic. In our previous work, we
aimed to find an improved method of clustering that would give us a high

posted online from a Computer Science course at the University of Bath. A
significant number of these questions contained code excerpts, which we found
caused a problem in clustering, as certain terms were being considered as

March 2020 to contain the spread of COVID-19, leading to an unprecedented
decline in anthropogenic activities and in turn improvements in ambient air
quality. This is the first study to focus on highly time-resolved chemical
speciation and source apportionment of PM$_{2.5}$ to assess the impact of the
lockdown and subsequent relaxations on the sources of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ in
Delhi, India. The elemental, organic, and black carbon fractions of PM$_{2.5}$
were measured at the IIT Delhi campus from February 2020 to May 2020. We report
source apportionment results using positive matrix factorization (PMF) of
organic and elemental fractions of PM$_{2.5}$ during the different phases of
the lockdown. The resolved sources such as vehicular emissions, domestic coal
combustion, and semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosol (SVOOA) were found to
decrease by 96%, 95%, and 86%, respectively, during lockdown phase-1 as
compared to pre-lockdown. An unforeseen rise in O$_3$ concentrations with
declining NO$_x$ levels was observed, similar to other parts of the globe,
leading to the low-volatility oxygenated organic aerosols (LVOOA) increasing to
almost double the pre-lockdown concentrations during the last phase of the
lockdown. The effect of the lockdown was found to be less pronounced on other
resolved sources like secondary chloride, power plants, dust-related,
hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA), and biomass burning related emissions,
which were also swayed by the changing meteorological conditions during the
four lockdown phases. The results presented in this study provide a basis for
future emission control strategies, quantifying the extent to which
constraining certain anthropogenic activities can ameliorate the ambient air.

However,
pandemics like covid-19 require deep learning capabilities at mobile devices
(detect respiratory rate using mobile robotics or conduct CT scan using a
mobile scanner), which are severely constrained by the limited storage and
computation resources at the device level. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-tier architecture, including robot layers, edge layers, and cloud layers.
We adopt this architecture to design a non-contact respiratory monitoring
system to break down respiratory rate calculation tasks. Experimental results
of respiratory rate monitoring show that the proposed approach in this paper
significantly outperforms other approaches. It is supported by computation time
costs with 2.26 ms per frame, 27.48 ms per frame, 0.78 seconds for convolution
operation, similarity calculation, processing one-minute length respiratory
signals, respectively. And the computation time costs of our three-tier
architecture are less than that of edge+cloud architecture and cloud
architecture. Moreover, we use our three-tire architecture for CT image
diagnosis task decomposition. The evaluation of a CT image dataset of COVID-19
proves that our three-tire architecture is useful for resolving tasks on deep
learning networks by edge equipment. There are broad application scenarios in
smart hospitals in the future.

affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the
WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of

accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse
transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence
of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples. But, RT-PCR
suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore,
the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of
COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage
exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for
X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be used

Deep feature sets extracted by using CNNs were concatenated for feature level
fusion and fed to multiple classifiers in terms of decision level fusion idea
with the aim of discriminating COVID-19, pneumonia and no-finding classes. In
the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the
resultant decisions of classifiers. The obtained accuracy values and confusion

United States collected biomarkers and information on protective behavior
related to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Several features of the survey make it
difficult to estimate past prevalence: 1) a low response rate, 2) very low
number of positive cases, and 3) the fact that multiple, poor quality
serological tests were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We describe a new
Bayesian approach for analyzing the biomarker data that simultaneously
addresses these challenges and characterizes the potential effect of selective
response. The model does not require survey sample weights, accounts for
multiple, imperfect antibody test results, and characterizes uncertainty
related to the sample survey and the multiple, imperfect, potentially
correlated tests.

  satellite comparison","'Lockdown' periods in response to COVID-19 have provided a unique opportunity
to study the impacts of economic activity on environmental pollution (e.g.
NO$_2$, aerosols, noise, light). The effects on NO$_2$ and aerosols have been
very noticeable and readily demonstrated, but that on light pollution has
proven challenging to determine. The main reason for this difficulty is that
the primary source of nighttime satellite imagery of the earth is the
SNPP-VIIRS/DNB instrument, which acquires data late at night after most human
nocturnal activity has already occurred and much associated lighting has been
turned off. Here, to analyze the effect of lockdown on urban light emissions,
we use ground and satellite data for Granada, Spain, during the COVID-19
induced confinement of the city's population from March 14 until May 31, 2020.
We find a clear decrease in light pollution due both to a decrease in light
emissions from the city and to a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol content in
the atmosphere which resulted in less light being scattered. A clear
correlation between the abundance of PM10 particles and sky brightness is
observed, such that the more polluted the atmosphere the brighter the urban
night sky. An empirical expression is determined that relates PM10 particle
abundance and sky brightness at three different wavelength bands.

stringent measures have been relaxed, customers must visit shop premises in

as far as possible while retaining economic viability of the shop. We therefore
explore and compare the spread of COVID-19 in different shopping situations
involving person-to-person interactions: (i) free-flowing, unstructured
shopping; (ii) structured shopping (e.g. a queue). We examine which of (i) or
(ii) may be preferable for minimising the spread of COVID-19 in a given shop,
subject to constraints such as the geometry of the shop; compliance of the
population to local guidelines; and additional safety measures which may be
available to the organisers of the shop. We derive a series of conclusions,
such as unidirectional free movement being preferable to bidirectional
shopping, and that the number of servers should be maximised as long as they
can be well protected from infection.

question, we compare the actual data to a hypothetical case in which the
mitigation measures are left intact using a projection of the data from before
mitigation measures were eased. We find that different states have shown
significant differences in the number of deaths, possibly due to their
different policies and reopening schedules. Our study provides a gauge for the

a guide for implementing best policies in the future. It also indicates that

PUR$\diamond$GEM consists of a series of UV disinfection chambers through which
constant airflow is maintained via fans. A minimum air flow rate of $\sim20-30$
L/min is sufficient to keep CO$_2$ levels $\lesssim$ 0.5% in the hood/helmet.
We validated that using easily available PTFE wrap, a factor of $\sim 18$

analysis is presented for the air travel time distributions through the
cavities, and the expectation value for actual pathogen elimination is
computed. We provide the scaling of pathogen elimination with the number of
cavities in series, reflective enhancement, UV source power, sphere radius and
airflow rate. We show that disinfection greater than 4-log is achievable for a

spheres of 10 cm diameter each in series for each direction of disinfection.
Using UVC LEDs emitting $\sim$ 40 mW of power each with an airflow rate of 30
L/min, actual SARS-COV2 virus elimination of $\sim$ 98% is expected. While not
manually feasible to construct smaller spheres in the lab, smaller cavities can
be commercially manufactured, leading to significantly higher actual pathogen

  to time-varying SIR model for Covid-19 epidemic","Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a mathematical model for dynamical
systems. For its intuitive appeal to modelling, the ODE is used in many
application areas such as climatology, bioinformatics, disease modelling and
chemical engineering. Despite ODE's wide usage in modelling, there are
difficulties in estimating ODE parameters from the data due to frequent absence
of their analytic solutions. The ODE model typically requires enormous
computing time and shows poor performance in estimation especially when the
model has a lot of variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE
parameter estimating algorithm which is fast and accurate even for models with
many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a
state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver. It allows fast
estimation by avoiding computations of a whole numerical solution in the
likelihood. The posterior is obtained by a variational Bayes method, more
specifically, the \textit{approximate Riemannian conjugate gradient method}
\cite**{honkela2010approximate}, which avoids samplings based on Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC). In simulation studies we compared the speed and performance
of proposed method with existing methods. The proposed method showed the best
performance in the reproduction of the true ODE curve with strong stability as
well as the fastest computation, especially in a large model with more than 30
parameters. As a real-world data application a SIR model with time-varying
parameters was fitted to the COVID-19 data. Taking advantage of our proposed

  COVID-19 Pandemic","The electric power grid is a complex cyberphysical energy system (CPES) in
which information and communication technologies (ICT) are integrated into the
operations and services of the power grid infrastructure. The growing number of
Internet-of-things (IoT) high-wattage appliances, such as air conditioners and
electric vehicles, being connected to the power grid, together with the high
dependence of ICT and control interfaces, make CPES vulnerable to high-impact,
low-probability load-changing cyberattacks. Moreover, the side-effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate a modification of electricity consumption
patterns with utilities experiencing significant net-load and peak reductions.
These unusual sustained low load demand conditions could be leveraged by
adversaries to cause frequency instabilities in CPES by compromising hundreds
of thousands of IoT-connected high-wattage loads. This paper presents a
feasibility study of the impacts of load-changing attacks on CPES during the
low loading conditions caused by the lockdown measures implemented during the
COVID-19 pandemic. The load demand reductions caused by the lockdown measures
are analyzed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), focusing on the
March-to-July 2020 period and the New York region as the most impacted time
period and location in terms of load reduction due to the lockdowns being in
full execution. Our feasibility study evaluates load-changing attack scenarios
using real load consumption data from the New York Independent System Operator
(NYISO) and shows that an attacker with sufficient knowledge and resources
could be capable of producing frequency stability problems, with frequency
excursions going up to 60.5 Hz and 63.4 Hz, when no mitigation measures are
taken.

ground air pollution monitoring stations, training a long-term prediction model
and comparing its predictions to measured values over the lockdown month.We
show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the data from air

estimates are consistent with recent publications, yet in contrast to prior
works, our method takes local weather into account. What can we learn from
pollution emissions during lockdown? The lockdown period was too short to train
meaningful models from scratch. To tackle this problem, we use transfer
learning to newly fit only traffic-dependent variables. We show that the
resulting models are accurate, suitable for an analysis of the post-lockdown

Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by

merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be

modeling, data-driven models are emerging for disease forecasting. As a case
study, we compare these two types of models for COVID-19 forecasting and notice
that physics-based models significantly outperform deep learning models. We
present a hybrid approach, AutoODE-COVID, which combines a novel compartmental
model with automatic differentiation. Our method obtains a 57.4% reduction in
mean absolute errors for 7-day ahead COVID-19 forecasting compared with the
best deep learning competitor. To understand the inferior performance of deep
learning, we investigate the generalization problem in forecasting. Through
systematic experiments, we found that deep learning models fail to forecast
under shifted distributions either in the data domain or the parameter domain.
This calls attention to rethink generalization especially for learning
dynamical systems.

  Machine Learning Analysis of Blood Cell Transcriptome Data","Introduction: For COVID-19 patients accurate prediction of disease severity
and mortality risk would greatly improve care delivery and resource allocation.
There are many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities that
affect disease severity. Since rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood
samples is widely available, we investigated how such data from the peripheral
blood of COVID-19 patients might be used to predict clinical outcomes.
  Methods: We thus investigated such clinical datasets from COVID-19 patients
with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods
with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random
forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine,
K-nearest neighbour and deep learning methods.
  Results: Our work revealed several clinical parameters measurable in blood
samples, which discriminated between healthy people and COVID-19 positive
patients and showed predictive value for later severity of COVID-19 symptoms.
We thus developed a number of analytic methods that showed accuracy and
precision for disease severity and mortality outcome predictions that were
above 90%.
  Conclusions: In sum, we developed methodologies to analyse patient routine
clinical data which enables more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient
outcomes. This type of approaches could, by employing standard hospital
laboratory analyses of patient blood, be utilised to identify, COVID-19
patients at high risk of mortality and so enable their treatment to be
optimised.

industry despite various protective measures, and temperature and ventilation

study examined meat and poultry plants to examine possible risk factors.
Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment
and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable
logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least
1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk
factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with
19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants
with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat
cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal
ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an effect for ventilation
rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including
temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the effect of the
ventilation rate did not change. Increasing room temperatures resulted in a
lower chance of obtaining a positive COVID-19 test result (AOR 0.90 95% CI
0.82-0.99), and a 0.1% greater chance of a positive COVID-19 test for the
interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003). Our results further indicate
that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are factors that can promote
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible requirement for pandemic
mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to increase the
ventilation rate.

global epidemic, which has had a great impact on public health and the economy.
The automatic segmentation of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) has
become an effective method for diagnosis. In order to realize the full
potential of deep learning models in COVID-19 pneumonia infections
segmentation, a great deal of annotated CT data is needed for training. The
data is difficult to collect due to the high risk of infection, and it is
laborious to annotate. Recent advances in image synthesis make it possible to
train deep learning models on realistic synthetic data with computer-generated
annotations. However, the domain shift between real data and synthetic data
significantly reduces segmentation performance. In order to solve this issue,
we propose a novel domain adaptation based COVID-19 CT lung infections
segmentation network. In this work, we use limited real data without
annotations and a large amount of annotated synthetic data to train the U-Net
segmentation network jointly. To overcome the domain mismatch, we introduce
conditional GAN for adversarial training. We update the segmentation network
with the cross-domain adversarial loss. This makes the embedding distribution
learned by segmentation network from real data and synthetic data closer, thus
greatly improving the representation ability of the segmentation network. The
experiment results demonstrate that our proposed network significantly
outperforms the baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

based on agent-based simulation modelling show that whilst requiring a lockdown
is widely believed to be the most efficient method to quickly reduce infection
numbers, the practice of social distancing and the usage of surgical masks can
potentially be more effective than requiring a lockdown. Our multivariate
analysis of simulation results using the Morris Elementary Effects Method
suggests that if a sufficient proportion of the population wore surgical masks
and followed social distancing regulations, then SARS-CoV-2 infections can be
controlled without requiring a lockdown.

or herd immunity. Neither of them will be attained within a few months for the
COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analytically derive the existence of a third,
viable solution: a stable equilibrium at low case numbers, where
test-trace-and-isolate policies partially compensate for local spreading
events, and only moderate contact restrictions remain necessary. Across wide
parameter ranges of our complementary compartmental model, the equilibrium is
reached at or below 10 daily new cases per million people. Such low levels had
been maintained over months in most European countries. However, this
equilibrium is endangered (i) if contact restrictions are relaxed, or (ii) if
case numbers grow too high. The latter destabilisation marks a novel tipping
point beyond which the spread self-accelerates because test-trace-and-isolate
capacities are overwhelmed. To reestablish control quickly, a lockdown is
required. We show that a lockdown is either effective within a few weeks, or
tends to fail its aim. If effective, recurring lockdowns are not necessary --
contrary to the oscillating dynamics previously presented in the context of
circuit breakers, and contrary to a regime with high case numbers -- if
moderate contact reductions are maintained. Hence, at low case numbers, the
control is easier, and more freedom can be granted. We demonstrate that this
strategy reduces case numbers and fatalities by a factor of 5 compared to a
strategy focused only on avoiding major congestion of hospitals. Furthermore,
our solution minimises lockdown duration, and hence economic impact. In the
long term, control will successively become easier due to immunity through
vaccination or large scale testing programmes. International coordination would
facilitate even more the implementation of this solution.

  Measures Be Taken?","During the course of an epidemic, one of the most challenging tasks for
authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and
when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully
rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an
exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible.
Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an
important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the
political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection
theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and
develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime
to a critical one. A new sequential test -- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic
sequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available
COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST
is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off
between average decision delay $\Delta$ and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely
proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary
restrictive measures. We find that all the countries share the same behaviour
in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales exponentially with
the delay, $R \sim \exp{(-\omega \Delta)}$, where $\omega$ depends on the
specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one possibility in ten
thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of countermeasures every 27~years,
on the average), the proposed algorithm detects the onset of the critical
regime with delay between a few days to three weeks, much earlier than when the
exponential growth becomes evident.

  Study on Dual-Patient Ventilation During the COVID-19 Pandemic","A variety of optimal control, estimation, system identification and design
problems can be formulated as functional optimization problems with
differential equality and inequality constraints. Since these problems are
infinite-dimensional and often do not have a known analytical solution, one has
to resort to numerical methods to compute an approximate solution. This paper
uses a unifying notation to outline some of the techniques used in the
transcription step of simultaneous direct methods (which
discretize-then-optimize) for solving continuous-time dynamic optimization
problems. We focus on collocation, integrated residual and Runge-Kutta schemes.
These transcription methods are then applied to a simulation case study to
answer a question that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely: If there are
not enough ventilators, is it possible to ventilate more than one patient on a
single ventilator? The results suggest that it is possible, in principle, to
estimate individual patient parameters sufficiently accurately, using a
relatively small number of flow rate measurements, without needing to
disconnect a patient from the system or needing more than one flow rate sensor.
We also show that it is possible to ensure that two different patients can
indeed receive their desired tidal volume, by modifying the resistance
experienced by the air flow to each patient and controlling the ventilator
pressure.

The current gold-standard test, Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction

a more accurate alternative has the challenge of distinguishing COVID-19 from
other pneumonia diseases. Artificial intelligence can help radiologists and
physicians to accelerate the process of diagnosis, increase its accuracy, and

neural network to distinguish healthy people, patients with COVID-19, and
patients with other pneumonia diseases from axial lung CT-scan images. Our
model also detects the infected areas and calculates the percentage of the
infected lung volume. We first preprocessed the images to eliminate the batch
effects of different devices, and then adopted a weakly supervised method to
train the model without having any tags for the infected parts. We trained and
evaluated the model on a large dataset of 3359 samples from 6 different medical
centers. The model reached sensitivities of 97.75% and 98.15%, and
specificities of 87% and 81.03% in separating healthy people from the diseased

performance for 1435 samples from 6 different medical centers which proves its
generalizability. The performance of the model on a large diverse dataset, its

widespread and unexpected social and economic change. These changes can force
workers to transition to new jobs. This may be because technologies emerge or
production is moved abroad. Perhaps it is a global crisis, such as COVID-19,
which shutters industries and displaces labor en masse. Regardless of the
impetus, people are faced with the challenge of moving between jobs to find new
work. Successful transitions typically occur when workers leverage their
existing skills in the new occupation. Here, we propose a novel method to
measure the similarity between occupations using their underlying skills. We
then build a recommender system for identifying optimal transition pathways
between occupations using job advertisements (ads) data and a longitudinal
household survey. Our results show that not only we can accurately predict
occupational transitions (Accuracy = 76%), but we account for the asymmetric
difficulties of moving between jobs (it is easier to move in one direction than
the other). We also build an early warning indicator for new technology
adoption (showcasing Artificial Intelligence), a major driver of rising job
transitions. By using real-time data, our systems can respond to labor demand
shifts as they occur (such as those caused by COVID-19), and can be leveraged
by policy-makers, educators, and jobseekers who are forced to confront the
often distressing challenges of having to find new jobs.

  the COVID-19 pandemic","As of November 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in
many countries. In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late
spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew
throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of
the effective reproduction numbers ${\cal R}(t)$ for each country by
integrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based
on the estimated ${\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.
The result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries
respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we
extend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$
of new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social
response is on the form $d_t{\cal R}=-\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold
for response. The response rate $\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or
above this threshold, on three parameters $\nu_1,\;\nu_2,\,\nu_3,$, and on $t$.
When $X<X^*$, $\nu= \nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when
the incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\nu=\nu_2\exp{(-\nu_3t)}$, models the
impact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\nu_3$
represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time
passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19
epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters
$\nu_1,\,\nu_2,\,\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\cal R}_0$, for
different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social
responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave
in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during
the summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the
fall.

people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little
research on the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups
in US cities during the pandemic. The authors worked to fill this gap by
quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater
Houston, Texas. In this study, we determined human mobility using
pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal
study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total
travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip
distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent
disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular,
there was a strong negative correlation ($\rho$ = -0.90) between a traveler's
estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility
adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets
experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of
distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The
findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the
mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The
study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and

  infectious diseases","Pandemics, like the 1918 Spanish Influenza and COVID-19, spread through
regions of the World in subsequent waves. There is, however, no consensus on
the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather
than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or
others based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the
disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless,
understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing
effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave
pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is
guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show
that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation
symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching
a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves
is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time
scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model
featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control
the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in
between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting
the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or
delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding
principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb
pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of
human life loss and economic damage.

  than one?","The importance of a strict quarantine has been widely debated during the
COVID-19 epidemic even from the purely epidemiological point of view. One
argument against strict lockdown measures is that once the strict quarantine is
lifted, the epidemic comes back, and so the cumulative number of infected
individuals during the entire epidemic will stay the same. We consider an SIR
model on a network and follow the disease dynamics, modeling the phases of
quarantine by changing the node degree distribution. We show that the system
reaches different steady states based on the history: the outcome of the
epidemic is path-dependent despite the same final node degree distribution. The
results indicate that two-phase route to the final node degree distribution (a
strict phase followed by a soft phase) are always better than one phase (the
same soft one) unless all the individuals have the same number of connections
at the end (the same degree); in the latter case, the overall number of
infected is indeed history-independent. The modeling also suggests that the
optimal procedure of lifting the quarantine consists of releasing nodes in the
order of their degree - highest first.

geographical diversity and avoid unfairness in the sense of demographic
disparity. During the development of this work, the COVID-19 pandemic is still
spreading in the U.S. and other parts of the world on large scale. Many poor
communities and minority groups are much more vulnerable than the rest. To
provide sufficient vaccine and medical resources to all residents and
effectively stop the further spreading of the pandemic, the average medical
resources per capita of a community should be independent of the community's
demographic features but only conditional on the exposure rate to the disease.
In this article, we integrate different aspects of resource allocation and seek
a synergistic intervention strategy that gives vulnerable populations with
higher priority when distributing medical resources. This prevention-centered
strategy is a trade-off between geographical coverage and social group
fairness. The proposed principle can be applied to other scarce resources and
social benefits allocation.

  COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Distribution","The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains,
as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections.
Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain
publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting
modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that
models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on
individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy
necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency
settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain
resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely
qualitative in nature; evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further,
publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific
supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as
transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine
production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major
gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of
real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We
conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that
encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical
networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale
COVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic
underscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a
multi-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into
analysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover,
adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.

  Features","The application of computer vision for COVID-19 diagnosis is complex and
challenging, given the risks associated with patient misclassifications.
Arguably, the primary value of medical imaging for COVID-19 lies rather on
patient prognosis. Radiological images can guide physicians assessing the
severity of the disease, and a series of images from the same patient at
different stages can help to gauge disease progression. Hence, a simple method
based on lung-pathology interpretable features for scoring disease severity
from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution, this method
correlates well to patient severity in different stages of disease progression
with competitive results compared to other existing, more complex methods. An
original data selection approach is also proposed, allowing the simple model to
learn the severity-related features. It is hypothesized that the resulting
competitive performance presented here is related to the method being
feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or opacity as others in
the literature. A second contribution comes from the validation of the results,
conceptualized as the scoring of patients groups from different stages of the
disease. Besides performing such validation on an independent data set, the
results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the
literature. The results show that there is a significant correlation between
the scoring system (MAVIDH) and patient outcome, which could potentially help
physicians rating and following disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

the existing time risk prediction models, the proposed CA-SUIR model shows the
multi-level risk of the county to the government and coronavirus transmission
patterns under different policies. This new toolbox is first utilized to the
projection of the multi-level COVID-19 prevalence over 412 Landkreis (counties)
in Germany, including t-day-ahead risk forecast and the risk assessment to the
travel restriction policy. As a practical illustration, we predict the
situation at Christmas where the worst fatalities are 34.5 thousand, effective
policies could contain it to below 21 thousand. Such intervenable evaluation
system could help decide on economic restarting and public health policies
making in pandemic.

passports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medical
and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been
less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes.
These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and
vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes
have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized
Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity
standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents
that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the
questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity
passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography
theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to
allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization.
Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases
like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity
totalitarianism.

  migration-based epidemiological model","The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a
worldwide threat to human life since its invasion into the daily lives of the
public in the first several months of 2020. Predicting the size of confirmed
cases is important for countries and communities to make proper prevention and
control policies so as to effectively curb the spread of COVID-19. Different
from the 2003 SARS epidemic and the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic,
COVID-19 has unique epidemiological characteristics in its infectious and
recovered compartments. This drives us to formulate a new infectious dynamic
model for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic within the human mobility network,
named the SaucIR-model in the sense that the new compartmental model extends
the benchmark SIR model by dividing the flow of people in the infected state
into asymptomatic, pathologically infected but unconfirmed, and confirmed.
Furthermore, we employ dynamic modeling of population flow in the model in
order that spatial effects can be incorporated effectively. We forecast the
spread of accumulated confirmed cases in some provinces of mainland China and
other countries that experienced severe infection during the time period from
late February to early May 2020. The novelty of incorporating the geographic
spread of the pandemic leads to a surprisingly good agreement with published
confirmed case reports. The numerical analysis validates the high degree of
predictability of our proposed SaucIR model compared to existing resemblance.
The proposed forecasting SaucIR model is implemented in Python. A web-based
application is also developed by Dash (under construction).

they have to be obtained as an outcome of the model. Here, we introduce a

exponential function in the bulk, while their tail obeys the Pareto power law.
The recently introduced $\kappa$-statistics framework predicts distribution
functions with this feature. A growing number of applications in different
fields of investigation are beginning to prove the relevance and effectiveness
of $\kappa$-statistics in fitting empirical data. In this paper, we use
$\kappa$-statistics to formulate a statistical approach for epidemiological
analysis. We validate the theoretical results by fitting the derived
$\kappa$-Weibull distributions with data from the plague pandemic of 1417 in
Florence as well as data from the COVID-19 pandemic in China over the entire
cycle that concludes in April 16, 2020. As further validation of the proposed
approach we present a more systematic analysis of COVID-19 data from countries
such as Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom, obtaining very good agreement
between theoretical predictions and empirical observations. For these countries
we also study the entire first cycle of the pandemic which extends until the
end of July 2020. The fact that both the data of the Florence plague and those
of the Covid-19 pandemic are successfully described by the same theoretical
model, even though the two events are caused by different diseases and they are
separated by more than 600 years, is evidence that the $\kappa$-Weibull model
has universal features.

  study","The outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic results in unprecedented demand
for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of patients for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of
individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput
of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known

unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only
objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the
case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of
this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently
repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a
computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR
tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of
false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests,
especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001
the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing
the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of
individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more
than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests
in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the
expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the proposed
procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case of diseases
like COVID-19.

  parameters from lattice QCD","Non-perturbative scale-dependent renormalization problems are ubiquitous in
lattice QCD as they enter many relevant phenomenological applications. They
require solving non-perturbatively the renormalization group equations for the
QCD parameters and matrix elements of interest in order to relate their
non-perturbative determinations at low energy to their high-energy counterparts
needed for phenomenology. Bridging the large energy separation between the
hadronic and perturbative regimes of QCD, however, is a notoriously difficult
task. In this contribution, we critically address the challenges that
state-of-the-art lattice determinations of the QCD parameters have to face in
order to be significantly improved. In addition, we review a novel strategy
that has been recently put forward in order to solve this class of
non-perturbative renormalization problems, and discuss its implications for
future precision determinations. The new ideas exploit the decoupling of heavy
quarks to match $N_{\rm f}$-flavor QCD and the pure Yang-Mills theory. Through
this matching the computation of non-perturbative renormalization group

  tomography images for COVID-19 diagnosis","The great challenge for the humanity of the year 2020 is the fight against
COVID-19. The whole world is making a huge effort to find an effective vaccine
with purpose to protect people not yet infected. The alternative solution
remains early diagnosis, carried out through real-time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) test or thorax computer tomography (CT) scan images. Deep
learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks, represent a
methodology for the image analysis. They optimize the classification design
task, essential for an automatic approach on different types of images,
including medical. In this paper, we adopt pretrained deep convolutional neural
network architectures in order to diagnose COVID-19 disease on CT images. Our
idea is inspired by what the whole of humanity is achieving, substantially the
set of multiple contributions is better than the single one for the fight
against the pandemic. Firstly, we adapt, and subsequently retrain, for our
assumption some neural architectures adopted in other application domains.
Secondly, we combine the knowledge extracted from images by neural
architectures in an ensemble classification context. Experimental phase is
performed on CT images dataset and results obtained show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach with respect to state-of-the-art competitors.

face coverings. To address this we show that the underlying physics ensures
particles with diameters & 1 $\mu$m are efficiently filtered out by a simple
cotton or surgical mask. For particles in the submicron range the efficiency
depends on the material properties of the masks, though generally the
filtration efficiency in this regime varies between 30 to 60 % and
multi-layered cotton masks are expected to be comparable to surgical masks.
Respiratory droplets are conventionally divided into coarse droplets (> 5-10
$\mu$m) responsible for droplet transmission and aerosols (< 5-10 $\mu$m)
responsible for airborne transmission. Masks are thus expected to be highly
effective at preventing droplet transmission, with their effectiveness limited
only by the mask fit, compliance and appropriate usage. By contrast, knowledge
of the size distribution of bioaerosols and the likelihood that they contain
virus is essential to understanding their effectiveness in preventing airborne
transmission. We argue from literature data on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads that the
finest aerosols (< 1 $\mu$m) are unlikely to contain even a single virion in
the majority of cases; we thus expect masks to be effective at reducing the
risk of airborne transmission in most settings.

combination of a fast, biologically-grounded reward function and sequential

user-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and being
developed, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of both

statistical properties of the models, in particular the correlation functions
and the probability density function, have duly been computed. Our models,
which generalises a model previously proposed and published in a specialised
journal, take into account the adoption of the lockdown measures as well as the
crucial role of the hospitals and Health Care Institutes. To accomplish this
work we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious
=> Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-model
integrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown
measures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown
measures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again. However, in the
second scenario, beyond a certain threshold of the hospital capacities, the
Coronavirus is not only kept under control, but its capacity to spread tends to
diminish in time. Therefore, the combined effect of the lockdown measures with
the action of the hospitals and health Institutes is able to contain and dampen
the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. This result can be used during a period
of time when the massive distribution of delivery of a limited number of
vaccines in a given population is not yet feasible. By way of example, we
analysed the data for USA and France where the intensities of the noise have
been estimated by Statistical Mechanics. In particular, for USA we have
analysed two possible hypotheses: USA is still subject to the first wave of
infection by and USA is in the second (or third) wave of SARS-CoV-2
infection.The agreement between theoretical predictions and real data confirms
the validity of our approach.

tested based solely on a predefined risk of being infectious implies the
absolute case numbers reflect the prevalence, but turned out to be a poor
predictor, consistently overestimating growth rates at the beginning of two
COVID-19 epidemic waves. In contrast, assuming that testing capacity is fully
exploited performs better. This leads to using the percent-positive rate as a
more robust indicator of epidemic dynamics, however we find it is subject to a

geometric discrepancy indicator of Claveria et al. (2019).This approach allows
us quantifying the proportion of disagreement in business and consumer
expectations of 32 countries.We have used information from all monthly
forward-looking questions contained in Joint Harmonised Programme of Business
and Consumer Surveys conducted by the European Commission (the industry survey,
the service survey, the retail trade survey, the building survey and the
consumer survey).First, we have calculated a discrepancy indicator for each of
the 17 survey questions analysed, which allows us to approximate the proportion
of uncertainty about different aspects of economic activity, both form the
demand and the supply sides of the economy.We then use these indicators to
calculate disagreement indices at the sector level.We graphic the evolution of
the degree of uncertainty in the main economic sectors of the analysed
economies up to June 2020.We observe marked differences, both across variables,
sectors and countries since the inception of the COVID-19 crisis.Finally, by
adding the sectoral indicators, an indicator of business uncertainty is
calculated and compared with that of consumers.Again, we find substantial
differences in the evolution of uncertainty between managers and consumers.This
analysis seeks to offer a global overview of the degree of economic uncertainty
in the midst of the coronavirus crisis at the sectoral level.

may cripple their online learning experience. Understanding these barriers can
help academic institutions craft policies to advance and improve the students'

challenges of computing students in one private University in the Philippines
during the period where the entire Luzon region was placed under the Enhanced
Community Quarantine (ECQ) as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey
through MS Forms Pro was performed to identify the experiences of students in
online learning. The survey ran from March 16 to March 18, 2020, which yielded
a total of 300 responses. Descriptive statistics revealed that the top three
barriers and challenges encountered by students were 1. the difficulty of
clarifying topics or discussions with the professors, 2.the lack of study or
working area for doing online activities, and 3. the lack of a good Internet
connection for participating in online activities. It can be concluded that
both students and faculty members were not fully prepared to undergo full
online learning. More so, some faculty members may have failed to adapt to the
needs of the students in an online learning environment. While the primary data
of the study mainly came from the students, it would also be an excellent

million deaths, high morbidities, and economic distress worldwide. There is an
urgent need to identify medications that would treat and prevent novel diseases
like the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a promising
strategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due
to several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results
compared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore
computational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated
graph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID.
Although we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is
generic and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered
heterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases,
genes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem.
Specifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural
network (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered
graph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for
a disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as
Dexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different
pharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic). Out
of these 150 drugs, 46 drugs are currently in clinical trials. Dr-COVID is
evaluated in terms of its prediction performance and its ability to rank the
known treatment drugs for diseases as high as possible. For a majority of the
diseases, Dr-COVID ranks the actual treatment drug in the top 15.

greater dubious agenda and the chaotic fracturing of a society. The general
public has grown aware of the misuse of social media towards these nefarious
ends, where even global public health crises have not been immune to
misinformation (deceptive content spread without intended malice). In this
paper, we examine nearly 505K COVID-19-related tweets from the initial months
of the pandemic to understand misinformation as a function of bot-behavior and
engagement. Using a correlation-based feature selection method, we selected the
11 most relevant feature subsets among over 170 features to distinguish
misinformation from facts, and to predict highly engaging misinformation tweets
about COVID-19. We achieved an average F-score of at least 72\% with ten
popular multi-class classifiers, reinforcing the relevance of the selected
features. We found that (i) real users tweet both facts and misinformation,
while bots tweet proportionally more misinformation; (ii) misinformation tweets
were less engaging than facts; (iii) the textual content of a tweet was the
most important to distinguish fact from misinformation while (iv) user account
metadata and human-like activity were most important to predict high engagement
in factual and misinformation tweets; and (v) sentiment features were not
relevant.

  Informing Dissent, Disparities, and Dissemination","The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Little
is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the coming vaccines. We
adopt a human-guided machine learning framework (using more than 40,000
rigorously selected tweets from more than 20,000 distinct Twitter users) to
capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying
them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We
aggregate opinions at the state and country levels, and find that the major
changes in the percentages of different opinion groups roughly correspond to
the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the
pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using
multinomial logistic regression, we compare demographics, social capital,
income, religious status, political affiliations, geo-locations, sentiment of
personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level
pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and
causes of public opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically
disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold polarized opinions on potential
COVID-19 vaccines. The anti-vaccine opinion is the strongest among the people
who have the worst personal pandemic experience. Next, by conducting
counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about
the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding potential vaccines
for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine
acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based
study to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform
more effective vaccine distribution policies and strategies.

  sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Social media analysis has become a common approach to assess public opinion
on various topics, including those about health, in near real-time. The growing
volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine
learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of
social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical
problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when
applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be
particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of
interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the
effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments
expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the
COVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined
considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on
pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift.
Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address concept
drift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematic
misclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis when
the underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly.

  Detection using Chest X-rays Images","The use of computer-aided diagnosis in the reliable and fast detection of
coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a necessity to prevent the spread of
the virus during the pandemic to ease the burden on the medical infrastructure.
Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging techniques
as it is cheap, easily accessible, fast and portable. This paper explores the
effect of various popular image enhancement techniques and states the effect of
each of them on the detection performance. We have compiled the largest X-ray
dataset called COVQU-20, consisting of 18,479 normal, non-COVID lung opacity
and COVID-19 CXR images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
public COVID positive database. Ground glass opacity is the common symptom
reported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and so a mixture of 3616 COVID-19, 6012
non-COVID lung opacity, and 8851 normal chest X-ray images were used to create
this dataset. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram
equalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, image
complement, gamma correction, and Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique were
used to improve COVID-19 detection accuracy. Six different Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) were investigated in this study. Gamma correction technique
outperforms other enhancement techniques in detecting COVID-19 from standard
and segmented lung CXR images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f1-score,
and specificity in the detection of COVID-19 with gamma correction on CXR
images were 96.29%, 96.28%, 96.29%, 96.28% and 96.27% respectively. The
accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11 %, 94.55

proposed approach with very high and comparable performance will boost the fast

world.In China, COVID-19 has caused severe consequences. Moreover, online
rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic increased people's panic about public
health and social stability. At present, understanding and curbing the spread
of online rumors is an urgent task. Therefore, we analyzed the rumor spreading
mechanism and propose a method to quantify a rumors' influence by the speed of
new insiders. The search frequency of the rumor is used as an observation
variable of new insiders. The peak coefficient and the attenuation coefficient
are calculated for the search frequency, which conforms to the exponential
distribution. We designed several rumor features and used the above two
coefficients as predictable labels. A 5-fold cross-validation experiment using
the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function showed that the decision tree
was suitable for predicting the peak coefficient, and the linear regression
model was ideal for predicting the attenuation coefficient. Our feature
analysis showed that precursor features were the most important for the
outbreak coefficient, while location information and rumor entity information
were the most important for the attenuation coefficient. Meanwhile, features
that were conducive to the outbreak were usually harmful to the continued
spread of rumors. At the same time, anxiety was a crucial rumor causing factor.
Finally, we discuss how to use deep learning technology to reduce the forecast

  discontinuous case","Epidemic spreading can be suppressed by the introduction of containment
measures such as social distancing and lock downs. Yet, when such measures are
relaxed, new epidemic waves and infection cycles may occur. Here we explore
this issue in compartmentalized epidemic models on graphs in presence of a
feedback between the infection state of the population and the structure of its
social network for the case of discontinuous control. We show that in random
graphs the effect of containment measures is simply captured by a
renormalization of the effective infection rate that accounts for the change in
the branching ratio of the network. In our simple setting, a piece-wise
mean-field approximations can be used to derive analytical formulae for the
number of epidemic waves and their length. A variant of the model with
imperfect information is used to model data of the recent covid-19 epidemics in
the Basque Country and Lombardy, where we estimate the extent of social network
disruption during lock downs and characterize the dynamical attractors.

  Empirical findings from Nanjing, China","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered a worldwide outbreak of
pandemic, and transportation services have played a key role in coronavirus
transmission. Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro
car, bike sharing users will be exposed to the bike surface and take the
transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and
avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike sharing. Based on
the trip data of bike sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel
demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the
perspective of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic
difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes
are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike
sharing during the pandemic. The results show that pandemic control strategies
sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly.
Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and
older adults are more dependent on bike sharing systems. Besides, the trip
decrease reduces user contact and increases idle bikes. And a new concept of
user distancing is proposed to avoid transmission risk and activate idle bikes.
This study evaluates the role of shared micro-mobility during the COVID-19

substantial challenges. Hence, usage of technology is anticipated to be the
precondition for adaptive, resilient, and sustainable development, where, a
smart city is defined as the accumulated advanced ideas of information and

Dhaka has already been labeled as the most densely populated city in the world.
Thus, concerned authorities are facing enormous challenges to provide and

technology-driven smart city for Bangladesh. A smart city may contain numerous
components; however, the proposed framework identifies seven components and

global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. While governments and healthcare
agencies are eager to mandate the deployment of such applications en-masse,
they face increasing scrutiny from the popular press, security companies, and
human rights watch agencies that fear the exploitation of these technologies as
surveillance tools. Finding the optimal balance between community safety and
privacy has been a challenge, and strategies to address these concerns have
varied among countries. This paper describes two important attacks that affect
a broad swath of contact-tracing applications. The first, referred to as
contact-isolation attack, is a user-privacy attack that can be used to identify
potentially infected patients in your neighborhood. The second is a
contact-pollution attack that affects the integrity of contact tracing
applications by causing them to produce a high volume of false-positive alerts.
We developed prototype implementations and evaluated both attacks in the
context of the DP-3T application framework, but these vulnerabilities affect a
much broader class of applications. We found that both attacks are feasible and
realizable with a minimal attacker work factor. We further conducted an impact
assessment of these attacks by using a simulation study and measurements from
the SafeGraph database. Our results indicate that attacks launched from a
modest number (on the order of 10,000) of monitoring points can effectively
decloak between 5-40\% of infected users in a major metropolis, such as
Houston.

  and its Clinical Applications in COVID-19","In recent years, deep learning-based image analysis methods have been widely
applied in computer-aided detection, diagnosis and prognosis, and has shown its
value during the public health crisis of the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. Chest radiograph (CXR) has been playing a crucial role in
COVID-19 patient triaging, diagnosing and monitoring, particularly in the
United States. Considering the mixed and unspecific signals in CXR, an image
retrieval model of CXR that provides both similar images and associated
clinical information can be more clinically meaningful than a direct image
diagnostic model. In this work we develop a novel CXR image retrieval model
based on deep metric learning. Unlike traditional diagnostic models which aims
at learning the direct mapping from images to labels, the proposed model aims
at learning the optimized embedding space of images, where images with the same
labels and similar contents are pulled together. It utilizes multi-similarity
loss with hard-mining sampling strategy and attention mechanism to learn the
optimized embedding space, and provides similar images to the query image. The
model is trained and validated on an international multi-site COVID-19 dataset
collected from 3 different sources. Experimental results of COVID-19 image
retrieval and diagnosis tasks show that the proposed model can serve as a
robust solution for CXR analysis and patient management for COVID-19. The model
is also tested on its transferability on a different clinical decision support
task, where the pre-trained model is applied to extract image features from a
new dataset without any further training. These results demonstrate our deep
metric learning based image retrieval model is highly efficient in the CXR
retrieval, diagnosis and prognosis, and thus has great clinical value for the
treatment and management of COVID-19 patients.

non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), have on the spread of the virus. In
this article, we use machine learning and apply drift detection methods in a
novel way to measure the effectiveness of policy interventions: We analyze the
effect of NPIs on the development of daily case numbers of COVID-19 across 9
European countries and 28 US states. Our analysis shows that it takes more than
two weeks on average until NPIs show a significant effect on the number of new
cases. We then analyze how characteristics of each country or state, e.g.,
decisiveness regarding NPIs, climate or population density, influence the time
lag until NPIs show their effectiveness. In our analysis, especially the timing
of school closures reveals a significant effect on the development of the
pandemic. This information is crucial for policy makers confronted with
difficult decisions to trade off strict containment of the virus with NPI
relief.

Germany, we show that NPIs reduced non-local contacts in the transmission
network, resulting in a change from an exponential to a constant regime. Due to
the small-world nature of the inferred network, exponential spread can be
efficiently prevented by reducing non-local contacts. Eliminating the disease
remains costly as it requires to reduce all contacts. Our code is freely

lot of activity in the lattice QCD community because a persistent tension of
about $3.5~\sigma$ is observed between the phenomenological estimate and the
Brookhaven measurement. The current best phenomenological estimate has an
uncertainty comparable to the experimental one and the error is completely
dominated by hadronic effects: the leading order hadronic vacuum polarization
(HVP) contribution and the hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering
contribution. Both are accessible via lattice simulations and a reduction of
the error by a factor 4 is required in view of the forthcoming experiments at
Fermilab and J-PARC whose results, expected in the next few years, should
reduce the experimental precision down to the level of $0.14~$ppm. In this

  Implicit Motive Pattern Recognition as Psychometric Signs of Severe Crises","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused international social tension and unrest.
Besides the crisis itself, there are growing signs of rising conflict potential
of societies around the world. Indicators of global mood changes are hard to
detect and direct questionnaires suffer from social desirability biases.
However, so-called implicit methods can reveal humans intrinsic desires from
e.g. social media texts. We present psychologically validated social unrest
predictors and replicate scalable and automated predictions, setting a new
state of the art on a recent German shared task dataset. We employ this model
to investigate a change of language towards social unrest during the COVID-19
pandemic by comparing established psychological predictors on samples of tweets
from spring 2019 with spring 2020. The results show a significant increase of
the conflict indicating psychometrics. With this work, we demonstrate the
applicability of automated NLP-based approaches to quantitative psychological
research.

  and Florida Line-Level Data","Since the COVID-19 pandemic first reached the United States, the case
fatality rate has fallen precipitously. Several possible explanations have been
floated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing,
shifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and
reported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and
decreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level
data and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April
1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each
stratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the
hypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to
decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in
the national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the
national data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second
wave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR.
By contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second
peak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first
and second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by
November 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in
age-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding
factors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic
picture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis
is that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by
artifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but
also the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified
line-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.

large population across the world and continues with its devastating
consequences. It is imperative to detect COVID-19 at the earliest to limit the
span of infection. In this work, a new classification technique CB-STM-RENet
based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Channel Boosting is
proposed for the screening of COVID-19 in chest X-Rays. In this connection, to
learn the COVID-19 specific radiographic patterns, a new convolution block
based on split-transform-merge (STM) is developed. This new block
systematically incorporates region and edge-based operations at each branch to
capture the diverse set of features at various levels, especially those related
to region homogeneity, textural variations, and boundaries of the infected
region. The learning and discrimination capability of the proposed CNN
architecture is enhanced by exploiting the Channel Boosting idea that
concatenates the auxiliary channels along with the original channels. The
auxiliary channels are generated from the pre-trained CNNs using Transfer
Learning. The effectiveness of the proposed technique CB-STM-RENet is evaluated
on three different datasets of chest X-Rays namely CoV-Healthy-6k,
CoV-NonCoV-10k, and CoV-NonCoV-15k. The performance comparison of the proposed
CB-STM-RENet with the existing techniques exhibits high performance both in
discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from Healthy, as well as, other types
of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all these
three datasets; especially on the stringent CoV-NonCoV-15k dataset. The good
detection rate (97%), and high precision (93%) of the proposed technique
suggest that it can be adapted for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients.

proposed as a tool to support the health authorities in their quest to
determine who has been in close and sustained contact with a person infected by
the coronavirus. In April 2020 Google and Apple released the Google Apple
Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework, as a decentralised and more privacy
friendly platform for contact tracing. The GAEN framework implements exposure
notification mostly at the operating system layer, instead of fully at the
app(lication) layer. In this paper we study the consequences of this approach.
We argue that this creates a dormant functionality for mass surveillance at the
operating system layer. We show how it does not technically prevent the health
authorities from implementing a purely centralised form of contact tracing
(even though that is the stated aim). We highlight that GAEN allows Google and
Apple to dictate how contact tracing is (or rather isn't) implemented in
practice by health authorities, and how it introduces the risk of function
creep.

stated that this virus is usually transmitted by droplets caused by sneezing or
coughing, or by touching infected surfaces. The presence of the virus is
detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)
tests with the help of a swab taken from the nose or throat. In addition, X-ray

that the accuracy sensitivity in rRT-PCR test is low, auxiliary diagnostic
methods have a very important place. Computer-aided diagnosis and detection
systems are developed especially with the help of X-ray and CT images. Studies

this study, the effect of different batch size (BH=3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50)

Specifically, we develop a regression model, inspired by delay differential

this exemplary modeling challenge, we illustrate how differentiable programming
can enable simple gradient-based optimization of the model by automatic
differentiation. This allowed us to quickly prototype a model under time
pressure that outperforms simpler benchmark models. We thus exemplify the
potential of differentiable programming also outside deep learning
applications, to provide more options for flexible applied statistical
modeling.

across the first six months of the global COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore
social factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.
  METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from
January to June 2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that
provided R0 estimates. For each study, the value of the estimate, country under
study and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value was calculated
per country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each
country with an R0 estimate, the Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable
Mobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and development status
were obtained from external sources.
  RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies
provided at least one estimate of R0, along with sufficient methodology to
explain how the value was calculated. Values of R0 ranged between 0.48 and
14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.
  CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the
estimates of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights
the spatial heterogeneity in R0. Higher values were recorded in more developed
countries, and countries with an older population or more sustainable mobility.
Countries with higher population density had lower R0 estimates. For most
regions, variability in R0 spiked initially before reducing and stabilising as

  review","The emergence of COVID-19 has necessitated many efforts by the scientific
community for its proper management. An urgent clinical reaction is required in
the face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. These
efforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening,
treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. The
use of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in all
of the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of Deep
Learning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19
management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DL
models are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Ray
images of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims to
detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19,
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal
conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the
affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better
understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either
independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and
AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model
development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope
with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical
applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented
to withstand the challenges posed by the global emergency

the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Recently, deep learning methods have
carried out state-of-the-art performances on medical image tasks. However,
conventional deep learning have two main drawbacks: 1) insufficient training
data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data.
In this paper, we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for
medical image classification. Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue
(Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed
Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the
novelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed
method has two components: Reduced-size Unet Segmentation model and Distant
Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to a not
well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant
Domain Transfer Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even
when the domains or the tasks are entirely different. In this study, we develop
a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31, Catech-256, and
chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19
lung CT as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the
proposed method benefits from unlabeled data collected from distant domains
which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the distribution
shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\%
classification accuracy, which is 13\% higher classification accuracy than
""non-transfer"" algorithms, and 8\% higher than existing transfer and distant
transfer algorithms.

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few
annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised
learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the
generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently
incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be
sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each
anatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach
with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on
the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph
neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical
regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences
between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph
representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in
full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets
of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods
that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify
the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well
to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals. Qualitative results suggest that
our model can identify clinically relevant regions in the images.

  Forward","Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology enthusiasts have pushed
for digital contact tracing as a critical tool for breaking the COVID-19
transmission chains. Motivated by this push, many countries and companies have
created apps that enable digital contact tracing with the goal to identify the
chain of transmission from an infected individual to others and enable early
quarantine. Digital contact tracing applications like AarogyaSetu in India,
TraceTogether in Singapore, SwissCovid in Switzerland, and others have been
downloaded hundreds of millions of times. Yet, this technology hasn't seen the
impact that we envisioned at the start of the pandemic. Some countries have
rolled back their apps, while others have seen low adoption.
  Therefore, it is prudent to ask what the technology landscape of
contact-tracing looks like and what are the missing pieces. We attempt to
undertake this task in this paper. We present a high-level review of
technologies underlying digital contact tracing, a set of metrics that are
important while evaluating different contact tracing technologies, and evaluate
where the different technologies stand today on this set of metrics. Our hope
is two-fold: (a) Future designers of contact tracing applications can use this
review paper to understand the technology landscape, and (b) Researchers can
identify and solve the missing pieces of this puzzle so that we are ready to
face the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemics. A majority of

epidemic. From the Stability analysis we see that the infection free
equilibrium remains asymptotically stable whenever $R_0 < 1$ and as $R_0$
crosses unity we have the infected equilibrium to be stable. From the
sensitivity analysis parameters $u_{11}$, $b_1$, $\beta_1$, $d_1$ and $\mu$

that the infection among the adult population(age $\geq 30)$ is least

$u_{11}$ and $u_{12}$ are considered together the infectives is minimum in case
of young populations(age $ \leq 30$). The cumulative infected population
reduced the maximum when the second control was considered followed by
considering both the controls together. The control $u_{12}$ was effective for
mild epidemic $(R_0 \in(1, 2))$ whereas control $u_{11}$ was found to be highly
effective when epidemic was severe $(R_0 \in(2, 7))$ for the population of age

gossips, ideas, packages and marketing pamphlets across a population. The
spread depends on how people move and co-locate with each other, or their
mobility patterns. How far such phenomena spread has significance for both
policy making and personal decision making, e.g., studying the spread of
COVID-19 under different intervention strategies such as wearing a mask. In
practice, mobility patterns of an entire population is never available, and we
usually have access to location data of a subset of individuals. In this paper,
we formalize and study the problem of estimating the spread of a phenomena in a
population, given that we only have access to sub-samples of location visits of
some individuals in the population. We show that simple solutions such as
estimating the spread in the sub-sample and scaling it to the population, or
more sophisticated solutions that rely on modeling location visits of
individuals do not perform well in practice, the former because it ignores
contacts between unobserved individuals and sampled ones and the latter because
it yields inaccurate modeling of co-locations. Instead, we directly model the
co-locations between the individuals. We introduce PollSpreader and
PollSusceptible, two novel approaches that model the co-locations between
individuals using a contact network, and infer the properties of the contact
network using the subsample to estimate the spread of the phenomena in the
entire population. We show that our estimates provide an upper bound and a
lower bound on the spread of the disease in expectation. Finally, using a large
high-resolution real-world mobility dataset, we experimentally show that our
estimates are accurate, while other methods that do not correctly account for
co-locations between individuals result in wrong observations (e.g, premature
herd-immunity).

the weighted average of binary cross entropy loss and dice loss to penalize

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While
contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path
to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate
the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores
either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume
uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on
reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics.
Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign
relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging
high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals.
While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an
individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary
mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore,
we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility
behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via

the spread of the virus can be prevented. For this reason, it has become an
area of interest to develop early diagnosis and detection methods to ensure a
rapid treatment process and prevent the virus from spreading. Since the
standard testing system is time-consuming and not available for everyone,
alternative early-screening techniques have become an urgent need. In this
study, the approaches used in the detection of COVID-19 based on deep learning

to remove noise. Next, deep features are extracted using multiple types of deep
models (pre-trained models, generative models, generic neural networks, etc.).
Finally, the classification is performed using the obtained features to decide

spanning late January to early May 2020, we applied methods including regular
expression filtering, supervised machine learning, sentiment analysis,
geospatial analysis, and dynamic topic modeling to trace the spread of
misinformation and to characterize novel features of COVID-19 conspiracy
theories.
  Results: Random forest models for four major misinformation topics provided
mixed results, with narrowly-defined conspiracy theories achieving F1 scores of
0.804 and 0.857, while more broad theories performed measurably worse, with
scores of 0.654 and 0.347. Despite this, analysis using model-labeled data was
beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation
indicators. We were able to identify distinct increases in negative sentiment,
theory-specific trends in geospatial spread, and the evolution of conspiracy
theory topics and subtopics over time.
  Conclusions: COVID-19 related conspiracy theories show that history
frequently repeats itself, with the same conspiracy theories being recycled for
new situations. We use a combination of supervised learning, unsupervised
learning, and natural language processing techniques to look at the evolution
of theories over the first four months of the COVID-19 outbreak, how these
theories intertwine, and to hypothesize on more effective public health
messaging to combat misinformation in online spaces.

essential information in hospital crisis planning, are necessary in a novel
pandemic when traditional data sources such as disease testing are limited.
Objective: Determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data
can be used as syndromic surveillance to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in
the communities where employees live. Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total
of 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841
employees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020,
who live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily
employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text
messaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean
absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital
census at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD
= 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120),
living in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Our model has an MAE of 6.9 COVID-19
patients and a WMAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital
network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5
patients (WMAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). At Hospital 1, a doubling of the
number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponds to 4 additional
employees reporting symptoms at the mean for Hospital 1) is associated with a
5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at Hospital 1 in 7 days (95% CI:
(0.02, 0.07)). Conclusions: We found that a real-time employee health
attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to predict subsequent
hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in
New England.

  Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach","To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the
passenger's perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage,
airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews
(OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics
approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted
using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and
two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,
we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the
individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most
representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a
review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the
predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot
of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established
by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a
bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis
within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the
proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective
performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR.
Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our
results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the
airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.

superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused
by individuals, plays an important role in the spread of COVID-19. In this
paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of
the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly,
we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to
estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of
COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of
the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves
the performance of prediction intervals. In a simplified model, we derive a
transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading to the width of
credible intervals for the reproduction number.

contrarily to the original problem, PCR testing employed for the detection of

in December 2019, continues to spread rapidly affecting the whole world. It is
essential to have a highly sensitive diagnostic screening tool to detect the
disease as early as possible. Currently, chest CT imaging is preferred as the
primary screening tool for evaluating the COVID-19 pneumonia by radiological
imaging. However, CT imaging requires larger radiation doses, longer exposure
time, higher cost, and may suffer from patient movements. X-Ray imaging is a
fast, cheap, more patient-friendly and available in almost every healthcare
facility. Therefore, we have focused on X-Ray images and developed an
end-to-end deep learning model, i.e. Ensemble-CVDNet, to distinguish COVID-19
pneumonia from non-COVID pneumonia and healthy cases in this work. The proposed
model is based on a combination of three lightweight pre-trained models
SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet-B0 at different depths, and combines
feature maps in different abstraction levels. In the proposed end to-end model,
networks are used as feature extractors in parallel after fine-tuning, and some
additional layers are used at the top of them. The proposed model is evaluated
in the COVID-19 Radiography Database, a public data set consisting of 219
COVID-19, 1341 Healthy, and 1345 Viral Pneumonia chest X-Ray images.
Experimental results show that our lightweight Ensemble-CVDNet model provides
98.30% accuracy, 97.78% sensitivity, and 97.61% F1 score using only 5.62M
parameters. Moreover, it takes about 10ms to process and predict an X-Ray image

second half of 2020 is unevenly distributed across regions. We utilise Fable
Data: a real-time source of consumption data that is a highly correlated,
leading indicator of Bank of England and Office for National Statistics data.
The UK's recovery is heavily weighted towards the ""home counties"" around outer
London and the South. We observe a stark contrast between strong online
spending growth while offline spending contracts. The strongest recovery in
spending is seen in online spending in the ""commuter belt"" areas in outer
London and the surrounding localities and also in areas of high second home
ownership, where working from home (including working from second homes) has
significantly displaced the location of spending. Year-on-year spending growth
in November 2020 in localities facing the UK's new tighter ""Tier 3""
restrictions (mostly the midlands and northern areas) was 38.4% lower compared
with areas facing the less restrictive ""Tier 2"" (mostly London and the South).
These patterns had been further exacerbated during November 2020 when a second
national lockdown was imposed. To prevent such COVID-19-driven regional
inequalities from becoming persistent we propose governments introduce
temporary, regionally-targeted interventions in 2021. The availability of

  connection","Recently in various theoretical works, a path-breaking progress has been made
to recover the well known Page Curve of an evaporating black hole with the help
of Quantum Extremal Surfaces (QES) aka Islands, which was mainly proposed to
solve the long-standing black hole information loss problem related to the
unitarity issue. Motivated by this outstanding concept, in this work, we study
the crucial role of Quantum Extremal Islands to reproduce the Page Curve in the
presence of negative (AdS) and positive (dS) Cosmological Constant with
radiation in the background of Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) space-time with the help of squeezed quantum state originated
cosmological complexity. Without using any explicit details of the
gravitational theoretical model, we establish a closed connecting relationship
among cosmological complexity, a measure of quantum chaos i.e., Out-of-Time
Ordered Correlators (OTOC) and quantum corrected entanglement entropy of
evaporating black hole in the presence of Cosmological Islands. This
alternative effective treatment finally helps us to reproduce to the most
desired Page Curve in Island inspired Cosmology to preserve the black hole
information loss issue. On top of this, the present treatment helps us to
interpret the explicit role of quantum chaos inside the evaporating black holes
in the presence of Cosmological Islands.

  on population risk factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the world by storm with its high infection
rate. Investigating its geographical disparities has paramount interest in
order to gauge its relationships with political decisions, economic indicators,
or mental health. This paper focuses on clustering the daily death rates
reported in several regions of Europe and the United States over eight months.
Several methods have been developed to cluster such functional data. However,
these methods are not translation-invariant and thus cannot handle different
times of arrivals of the disease, nor can they consider external covariates and
so are unable to adjust for the population risk factors of each region. We
propose a novel three-step clustering method to circumvent these issues. As a
first step, feature extraction is performed by translation-invariant wavelet
decomposition which permits to deal with the different onsets. As a second
step, single-index regression is used to neutralize disparities caused by
population risk factors. As a third step, a nonparametric mixture is fitted on
the regression residuals to achieve the region clustering. Supplementary
materials for this article, including a standardized description of the
materials available for reproducing the work, are available online.

the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in situations where it is easier and cheaper
to obtain X-ray data than to obtain high-quality images like those from CT
scans. Deep neural networks have repeatedly been shown to be capable of
constructing highly predictive models for disease detection directly from image
data. However, their use in assisting clinicians has repeatedly hit a stumbling
block due to their black-box nature. Some of this difficulty can be alleviated
if predictions were accompanied by explanations expressed in clinically
relevant terms. In this paper, deep neural networks are used to extract
domain-specific features(morphological features like ground-glass opacity and
disease indications like pneumonia) directly from the image data. Predictions
about these features are then used to construct a symbolic model (a decision
tree) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest X-rays, accompanied with two
kinds of explanations: visual (saliency maps, derived from the neural stage),
and textual (logical descriptions, derived from the symbolic stage). A
radiologist rates the usefulness of the visual and textual explanations. Our
results demonstrate that neural models can be employed usefully in identifying
domain-specific features from low-level image data; that textual explanations
in terms of clinically relevant features may be useful; and that visual
explanations will need to be clinically meaningful to be useful.

technique to cluster topics in a wide range of scenarios, including an
infodemic -- a period overabundance of the same information. In particular, the

  Information","New binary classification tests are often evaluated relative to a
pre-established test. For example, rapid Antigen tests for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 are assessed relative to more established PCR tests. In this paper,
I argue that the new test can be described as producing ambiguous information
when the pre-established is imperfect. This allows for a phenomenon called
dilation -- an extreme form of non-informativeness. As an example, I present
hypothetical test data satisfying the WHO's minimum quality requirement for
rapid Antigen tests which leads to dilation. The ambiguity in the information
arises from a missing data problem due to imperfection of the established test:
the joint distribution of true infection and test results is not observed.
Using results from Copula theory, I construct the (usually non-singleton) set
of all these possible joint distributions, which allows me to assess the new
test's informativeness. This analysis leads to a simple sufficient condition to
make sure that a new test is not a dilation. I illustrate my approach with
applications to data from three COVID-19 related tests. Two rapid Antigen tests
satisfy my sufficient condition easily and are therefore informative. However,
less accurate procedures, like chest CT scans, may exhibit dilation.

radiological images suffer shortcomings despite their many uses in diagnostic
centers. Accordingly, medical and computer researchers tended to use
machine-learning models to analyze radiology images.
  Methods: Present systematic review was conducted by searching three databases
of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science from November 1, 2019, to July 20, 2020
Based on a search strategy, the keywords were Covid-19, Deep learning,

ultimately, 37 articles were selected as the research population by applying
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result: This review study provides an
overview of the current state of all models for the detection and diagnosis of

extraordinary capacity to achieve an accurate and efficient system for the

  Methods: We examined a total of 13,723,810 responses to a daily
cross-sectional representative online survey in 38 countries who completed from
April 23, 2020 to October 31, 2020 and reported having been in public at least
once during the last seven days. The outcome was individual face mask usage in
public settings, and the predictors were country fixed effects, country-level
mask policy stringency, calendar time, individual sociodemographic factors, and
health prevention behaviors. Associations were modelled using survey-weighted
multivariable logistic regression.
  Findings: Mask-wearing varied over time and across the 38 countries. While
some countries consistently showed high prevalence throughout, in other
countries mask usage increased gradually, and a few other countries remained at
low prevalence. Controlling for time and country fixed effects,
sociodemographic factors (older age, female gender, education, urbanicity) and
stricter mask-related policies were significantly associated with higher mask
usage in public settings, while social behaviors considered risky in the
context of the pandemic (going out to large events, restaurants, shopping
centers, and socializing outside of the household) were associated with lower
mask use.
  Interpretation: The decision to wear a face mask in public settings is
significantly associated with sociodemographic factors, risky social behaviors,
and mask policies. This has important implications for health prevention
policies and messaging, including the potential need for more targeted policy
and messaging design.

C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every

collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then
characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of
features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the
firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local
outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn
""city-invariant"" representations from the mobility-related features for precise
early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases
known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher

Time (SOT), for a chosen risk tolerance level. As expected, we find that the
SOT decreases with ventilation quality. We also establish the recommended
""vacancy time"" after an activity in the room. For example, to achieve an
airborne transmission risk of less than 5%, the pre-pandemic ASHRAE recommended
ventilation would allow 37-minute lessons followed by 35-minute breaks but if
the ventilation is poor, 25-minute lessons should be followed by 166-minute
breaks. Our model also uncovers power-law relationships for the concentration
as a function of time and particle emission rate and for the TTI as a function
of ventilation rate and particle emission rate; these may be used as a fast
tool to predict the SOT in several realistic scenarios. Finally, we show that
wearing a mask of 50% efficiency could increase the SOT by 98% and reduce the
vacancy time by up to 55%, depending on the ventilation setting.

seeking models that could be used to predict not only the number of new cases
but also the levels of hospitalisation, critical care and deaths. In this paper
we present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and
forecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data,
reported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care
occupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering
technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases,
critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and
September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model
hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the
recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the
Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were
constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the
reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase
again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over
Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to
provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very
good for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the
pandemic. The model has been slower to pick up the increase in the case numbers
in September 2020 but forecasting improves again in the later stages of the
epidemic.

  Adoption Intention","Smartphone-based contact-tracing apps are a promising solution to help scale
up the conventional contact-tracing process. However, low adoption rates is a
major issue that prevents these apps from achieving their full potential. In
this paper, we present a national-scale survey experiment ($N = 1963$) in the
U.S. to investigate the effects of app design choices and individual
differences on COVID-19 contact-tracing app adoption intentions. We found that
individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk perceptions,
general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic factors played
a more important role than app design choices such as decentralized design vs.
centralized design, location use, app providers, and the presentation of
security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the different preferences
in different sub-populations which may lead to an inequality of acceptance to
certain app design choices (e.g., developed by state health authorities vs. a
large tech company) among different groups of people (e.g., people living in
rural areas vs. people living in urban areas). Our mediation analysis showed
that one's perception of the public health benefits offered by the app and the
adoption willingness of other people had a larger effect in explaining the
observed effects of app design choices and individual differences than one's
perception of the app's security and privacy risks. With these findings, we
discuss practical implications on the design, marketing, and deployment of
COVID-19 contact-tracing apps in the U.S.

detect infected people as well as people who recovered from the disease as
quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking
process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection
status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider
based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression
for this average difference for given test rates, and given infection and
recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based
algorithm to minimize this average difference. We observe that if the total
test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally,
only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and
recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track
the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size
increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates,
which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby
improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care
provider's preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either
the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.

  admission policy on COVID-19 mortalities","It is evident that increasing the intensive-care-unit (ICU) capacity and
giving priority to admitting and treating younger patients will reduce the
number of COVID-19 deaths, but a quantitative assessment of these measures has
remained inadequate. We develop a comprehensive, non-Markovian state transition
model, which is validated through accurate prediction of the daily death toll
for two epicenters: Wuhan, China and Lombardy, Italy. The model enables
prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment
priorities had been given to younger patients, the death toll in Wuhan and
Lombardy would have been reduced by 10.4\% and 6.7\%, respectively. The
strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with
a younger population structure. Analyses of data from China, South Korea,
Italy, and Spain suggest that countries with less per capita ICU medical
resources should implement this strategy in the early stage of the pandemic to
reduce mortalities.

  Applications","The novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly and abruptly changed the
world as we knew in 2020. It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic
epidemiology in general and signal processing theories in specific. Given its
high contingency nature and adverse effects across the world, it is important
to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic and
be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an
important role for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of
medical images is, however, tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in
a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models for analysis and interpretation
of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL) models can
assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis,
severity assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients.
In this article, we aim to present an overview of the current state,
challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered models for
diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity
assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by
elaborating the latest development on the theoretical framework of analytic
epidemiology and hypersignal processing for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging
modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are discussed.
SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are
then described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19
lesions; Predictive models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and;
Diagnosis/classification models. Finally, open problems and opportunities are
presented in detail.

automatic hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimisation combined with
HyperBand. The proposed method outperforms a traditional baseline approach by a

74.9%, or an Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) of 80.7% by ensembling neural networks,
considering the best test set result across breathing and coughing in a

appear slightly better suited than coughing ones (76.1% vs 73.7% UAR).

  pandemic using bivariate Poisson regression","In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, 2019-2020 soccer seasons across the world
were postponed and eventually made up during the summer months of 2020.
Researchers from a variety of disciplines jumped at the opportunity to compare
the rescheduled games, played in front of empty stadia, to previous games,
played in front of fans. To date, most of this post-Covid soccer research has
used linear regression models, or versions thereof, to estimate potential
changes to the home advantage. But because soccer outcomes are non-linear, we
argue that leveraging the Poisson distribution would be more appropriate. We
begin by using simulations to show that bivariate Poisson regression reduces
absolute bias when estimating the home advantage benefit in a single season of
soccer games, relative to linear regression, by almost 85 percent. Next, with
data from 17 professional soccer leagues, we extend bivariate Poisson models
estimate the change in home advantage due to games being played without fans.
In contrast to current research that overwhelmingly suggests a drop in the home
advantage, our findings are mixed; in some leagues, evidence points to a
decrease, while in others, the home advantage may have risen. Altogether, this
suggests a more complex causal mechanism for the impact of fans on sporting
events.

calling for efficient control and prevention measures. Understanding spreading
pattern of COVID-19 has been widely recognized as a vital step for implementing
non-pharmaceutical measures. Previous studies investigated such an issue in
large-scale (e.g., inter-country or inter-state) scenarios while urban
spreading pattern still remains an open issue. Here, we fill this gap by
leveraging the trajectory data of 197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808
anonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in China. We find a universal spreading
pattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a
power-law-like model and the spreading centroid is time-invariant. Moreover, we
reveal that human mobility in a city drives the spatialtemporal spreading
process: long average travelling distance results in a high growth rate of
spreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases. With such
insight, we adopt Kendall model to simulate urban spreading of COVID-19 that
can well fit the real spreading process. Our results unveil the underlying
mechanism behind the spatial-temporal urban evolution of COVID-19, and can be
used to evaluate the performance of mobility restriction policies implemented
by many governments and to estimate the evolving spreading situation of
COVID-19.

(COVID-19) causes the pneumonia-like effect in the lungs, the examination of
chest x-rays can help to diagnose the diseases. For automatic analysis of
images, they are represented in machines by a set of semantic features. Deep
Learning (DL) models are widely used to extract features from images. General
deep features may not be appropriate to represent chest x-rays as they have a
few semantic regions. Though the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) based features are
shown to be more appropriate for x-ray type of images, existing BoVW features
may not capture enough information to differentiate COVID-19 infection from

over deep features, called Bag of Deep Visual Words (BoDVW), by removing the
feature map normalization step and adding deep features normalization step on
the raw feature maps. This helps to preserve the semantics of each feature map
that may have important clues to differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed BoDVW features in chest x-rays
classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to diagnose COVID-19. Our
results on a publicly available COVID-19 x-ray dataset reveal that our features
produce stable and prominent classification accuracy, particularly
differentiating COVID-19 infection from other pneumonia, in shorter computation
time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Thus, our method could be a very

  Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation","The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has
spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.
Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an
important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major
challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,
there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing
the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19
segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven
collaborative learning model for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung
infection segmentation. The network consists of encoders with the same
architecture and a shared decoder. The general encoder is adopted to capture
general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, while the
target encoder is adopted to focus on task-specific features of COVID-19
infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated
for the subsequent decoder part. To thoroughly exploit shared knowledge between
COVID and non-COVID lesions, we develop a collaborative learning scheme to
regularize the relation consistency between extracted features of given input.
Other than existing consistency-based methods that simply enforce the
consistency of individual predictions, our method enforces the consistency of
feature relation among samples, encouraging the model to explore semantic
information from both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases. Extensive experiments on
one public COVID-19 dataset and two public non-COVID datasets show that our
method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with existing
methods in the absence of sufficient high-quality COVID-19 annotations.

  Perturbations","The black-box nature of the deep networks makes the explanation for ""why""
they make certain predictions extremely challenging. Saliency maps are one of
the most widely-used local explanation tools to alleviate this problem. One of
the primary approaches for generating saliency maps is by optimizing a mask
over the input dimensions so that the output of the network is influenced the
most by the masking. However, prior work only studies such influence by
removing evidence from the input. In this paper, we present iGOS++, a framework
to generate saliency maps that are optimized for altering the output of the
black-box system by either removing or preserving only a small fraction of the
input. Additionally, we propose to add a bilateral total variation term to the
optimization that improves the continuity of the saliency map especially under
high resolution and with thin object parts. The evaluation results from
comparing iGOS++ against state-of-the-art saliency map methods show significant
improvement in locating salient regions that are directly interpretable by
humans. We utilized iGOS++ in the task of classifying COVID-19 cases from x-ray

worst decline since the Great Recession in 2008, and the COVID-19 has been
widely blamed on the stock market crashes. In this study, we applied the
log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time
series to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market
crash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both
developed and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ,
FTSE, DAX, NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. In order to effectively
distinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash, we proposed using the
LPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the
apparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by
the accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the
price trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300,
BSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed
endogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes
for the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic
instability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as
the COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock
market crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not
been observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE,
NIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are
exogenous, stemming from external shocks. The novel classification method of
crash types proposed in this study can also be used to analyze regime changes
of any price trajectories in global financial markets.

spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g.,
mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We
apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding
light into several effects related to mobility restrictions introduced by the
government, and to the effectiveness of contact tracing and mass testing

This habit, however, often comes along with certain restrictions. For instance,
most statistical or epidemiological models cannot directly incorporate

mobility. In contrast, machine learning approaches may yield better predictions
by exploiting these data structures, yet lack intuitive interpretability as
they are often categorized as black-box models. We propose a trade-off between
both research directions and present a multimodal learning approach that
combines the advantages of statistical regression and machine learning models

generated when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. Wearing a mask is the
primary, effective, and convenient method of blocking 80% of all respiratory
infections. Therefore, many face mask detection and monitoring systems have
been developed to provide effective supervision for hospitals, airports,
publication transportation, sports venues, and retail locations. However, the
current commercial face mask detection systems are typically bundled with
specific software or hardware, impeding public accessibility. In this paper, we

  Wearing of Construction Workers in COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many shutdowns in different industries
around the world. Sectors such as infrastructure construction and maintenance
projects have not been suspended due to their significant effect on people's
routine life. In such projects, workers work close together that makes a high
risk of infection. The World Health Organization recommends wearing a face mask
and practicing physical distancing to mitigate the virus's spread. This paper
developed a computer vision system to automatically detect the violation of
face mask wearing and physical distancing among construction workers to assure
their safety on infrastructure projects during the pandemic. For the face mask
detection, the paper collected and annotated 1,000 images, including different
types of face mask wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask dataset
to develop a dataset of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple
Tensorflow state-of-the-art object detection models on the face mask dataset
and chose the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 network that yielded the
accuracy of 99.8%. For physical distance detection, the paper employed the
Faster R-CNN Inception V2 to detect people. A transformation matrix was used to
eliminate the camera angle's effect on the object distances on the image. The
Euclidian distance used the pixels of the transformed image to compute the
actual distance between people. A threshold of six feet was considered to
capture physical distance violation. The paper also used transfer learning for
training the model. The final model was applied on four videos of road
maintenance projects in Houston, TX, that effectively detected the face mask
and physical distance. We recommend that construction owners use the proposed
system to enhance construction workers' safety in the pandemic situation.

of COVID-19 cases, remains paramount as an intervention tool to curb the spread
of COVID-19 both at local and national levels. However, the speed at which the
pandemic struck and the response was rolled out, the widespread impact on
healthcare infrastructure, the lack of sufficient preparation within the public
health system, and the complexity of the crisis led to utter confusion among
test-takers. Invasion of privacy remains a crucial concern. The user experience
of test takers remains low. User friction affects user behavior and discourages
participation in testing programs. Test efficacy has been overstated. Test
results are poorly understood resulting in inappropriate follow-up
recommendations. Herein, we review the current landscape of COVID-19 testing,
identify four key challenges, and discuss the consequences of the failure to
address these challenges. The current infrastructure around testing and
information propagation is highly privacy-invasive and does not leverage
scalable digital components. In this work, we discuss challenges complicating
the existing covid-19 testing ecosystem and highlight the need to improve the
testing experience for the user and reduce privacy invasions. Digital tools

longitudinal or spatial studies. Among the existing statistical models the most
well-known one for this type of data is the multivariate probit model, which
uses a Gaussian link to model dependence at the latent level. However, a
symmetric link may not be appropriate if the data are highly imbalanced. Here,
we propose a multivariate skew-elliptical link model for correlated binary
responses, which includes the multivariate probit model as a special case.
Furthermore, we perform Bayesian inference for this new model and prove that
the regression coefficients have a closed-form unified skew-elliptical
posterior. The new methodology is illustrated by application to COVID-19
pandemic data from three different counties of the state of California, USA. By
jointly modeling extreme spikes in weekly new cases, our results show that the
spatial dependence cannot be neglected. Furthermore, the results also show that
the skewed latent structure of our proposed model improves the flexibility of
the multivariate probit model and provides better fit to our highly imbalanced
dataset.

individuals in the population are infected by a disease independently. However,
this assumption rarely holds in practice, as diseases typically spread through
connections between individuals. We introduce an infection model for networks,
inspired by characteristics of COVID-19 and similar diseases, which generalizes
the traditional i.i.d. model from probabilistic group testing. Under this
infection model, we ask whether knowledge of the network structure can be
leveraged to perform group testing more efficiently, focusing specifically on
community-structured graphs drawn from the stochastic block model. Through both
theory and simulations, we show that when the network and infection parameters
are conducive to ""strong community structure,"" our proposed adaptive,
graph-aware algorithm outperforms the baseline binary splitting algorithm, and
is even order-optimal in certain parameter regimes. Finally, we derive novel
information-theoretic lower bounds which highlight the fundamental limits of
adaptive group testing in our networked setting.

aggregated telecommunication data in a nationwide setting (Switzerland;
February 10 - April 26, 2020), consisting of ~1.5 billion trips. In comparison
to the same time period from 2019, human movement in Switzerland dropped by
49.1%. The strongest reduction is linked to bans on gatherings of more than 5
people, which is estimated to have decreased mobility by 24.9%, followed by
venue closures (stores, restaurants, and bars) and school closures. As such,
human mobility at a given day predicts reported cases 7-13 days ahead. A 1%
reduction in human mobility predicts a 0.88-1.11% reduction in daily reported
COVID-19 cases. When managing epidemics, monitoring human mobility via
telecommunication data can support public decision-makers in two ways. First,
it helps in assessing policy impact; second, it provides a scalable tool for
near real-time epidemic surveillance, thereby enabling evidence-based policies.

Application to the

affected humankind in the last century. In this paper, we propose a novel
mathematical epidemiological model named SUIHTER from the names of the seven
compartments that it comprises: susceptible uninfected individuals (S),
undetected (both asymptomatic and symptomatic) infected (U), isolated (I),
hospitalized (H), threatened (T), extinct (E), and recovered (R). A suitable
parameter calibration that is based on the combined use of least squares method
and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is proposed with the aim of
reproducing the past history of the epidemic in Italy, surfaced in late
February and still ongoing to date, and of validating SUIHTER in terms of its
predicting capabilities. A distinctive feature of the new model is that it
allows a one-to-one calibration strategy between the model compartments and the
data that are daily made available from the Italian Civil Protection. The new
model is then applied to the analysis of the Italian epidemic with emphasis on
the second outbreak emerged in Fall 2020. In particular, we show that the
epidemiological model SUIHTER can be suitably used in a predictive manner to
perform scenario analysis at national level.

  of COVID-19","The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of multiple
county-level features in the trajectory of COVID-19. We examined feature
importance across 2,787 counties in the United States using a data-driven
machine learning model. We trained random forest models using 23 features
representing six key influencing factors affecting pandemic spread: social
demographics of counties, population activities, mobility within the counties,
movement across counties, disease attributes, and social network structure.
Also, we categorized counties into multiple groups according to their
population densities, and we divided the trajectory of COVID-19 into three
stages: the outbreak stage, the social distancing stage, and the reopening
stage. The study aims to answer two research questions: (1) The extent to which
the importance of heterogeneous features evolves in different stages; (2) The
extent to which the importance of heterogeneous features varies across counties
with different characteristics. We fitted a set of random forest models to
determine weekly feature importance. The results showed that: (1) Social
demographic features, such as gross domestic product, population density, and
minority status maintained high-importance features throughout stages of
COVID-19 across the 2787 studied counties; (2) Within-county mobility features
had the highest importance in county clusters with higher population densities;
(3) The feature reflecting the social network structure (Facebook, social
connectedness index), had higher importance in the models for counties with
higher population densities. The results show that the data-driven machine
learning models could provide important insights to inform policymakers
regarding feature importance for counties with various population densities and
in different stages of a pandemic life cycle.

  using cloud computing based remote sensing","Global lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to changes in
the anthropogenic activities resulting in perceivable air quality improvements.
Although several recent studies have analyzed these changes over different
regions of the globe, these analyses have been constrained due to the usage of
station-based data which is mostly limited upto the metropolitan cities. Also,
the quantifiable changes have been reported only for the developed and
developing regions leaving the poor economies (e.g. Africa) due to the shortage
of in-situ data. Using a comprehensive set of high spatiotemporal resolution
satellites and merged products of air pollutants, we analyze the air quality
across the globe and quantify the improvement resulting from the suppressed
anthropogenic activity during the lockdowns. In particular, we focus on
megacities, capitals and cities with high standards of living to make the
quantitative assessment. Our results offer valuable insights into the spatial
distribution of changes in the air pollutants due to COVID-19 enforced
lockdowns. Statistically significant reductions are observed over megacities
with mean reduction by 19.74%, 7.38% and 49.9% in nitrogen dioxide (NO2),

systematically investigate the 2020 stock market crash in the U.S. equities
sectors with different levels of total market capitalizations through four
major U.S. stock market indexes, including the Wilshire 5000 Total Market
index, the S&P 500 index, the S&P MidCap 400 index, and the Russell 2000 index,
representing the stocks overall, the large capitalization stocks, the middle
capitalization stocks and the small capitalization stocks, respectively. During
the 2020 U.S. stock market crash, all four indexes lost more than a third of
their values within five weeks, while both the middle capitalization stocks and
the small capitalization stocks have suffered much greater losses than the
large capitalization stocks and stocks overall. Our results indicate that the
price trajectories of these four stock market indexes prior to the 2020 stock
market crash have clearly featured the obvious LPPLS bubble pattern and were
indeed in a positive bubble regime. Contrary to the popular belief that the
COVID-19 led to the 2020 stock market crash, the 2020 U.S. stock market crash
was endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic instability of the
stock market itself. We also performed the complementary post-mortem analysis
of the 2020 U.S. stock market crash. Our analyses indicate that the 2020 U.S.
stock market crash originated from a bubble which began to form as early as
September 2018; and the bubbles in stocks with different levels of total market
capitalizations have significantly different starting time profiles. This study
not only sheds new light on the making of the 2020 U.S. stock market crash but
also creates a novel pipeline for future real-time crash detection and
mechanism dissection of any financial market and/or economic index.

COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential
architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models
are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and
restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently
outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with
differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For
the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is
able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL
in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to
three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature
importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used
for EHR ML work in general.

monitoring blood volume changes from a camera. It may be especially useful for
widespread contact-less health monitoring when used to analyze face video from
consumer-grade visible-light cameras. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the
widespread use of protective face masks to prevent virus transmission. We found
that occlusions from face masks affect face video-based rPPG as the mean
absolute error of blood volume estimation is nearly doubled when the face is
partially occluded by protective masks. To our knowledge, this paper is the
first to analyse the impact of face masks on the accuracy of blood volume pulse
estimation and offers several novel elements: (a) two publicly available pulse
estimation datasets acquired from 86 unmasked and 61 masked subjects, (b)
evaluations of handcrafted algorithms and a 3D convolutional neural network
trained on videos of full (unmasked) faces and synthetically generated masks,
and (c) data augmentation method (a generator adding a synthetic mask to a face
video). Our findings help identify how face masks degrade accuracy of face
video analysis, and we discuss paths toward more robust pulse estimation in
their presence. The datasets and source codes of all proposed methods are

software engineers' daily life was disrupted and abruptly forced into remote
working from home. This change deeply impacted typical working routines,
affecting both well-being and productivity. Moreover, this pandemic will have
long-lasting effects in the software industry, with several tech companies
allowing their employees to work from home indefinitely if they wish to do so.
Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and understand how a typical working day
looks like when working from home and how individual activities affect software
developers' well-being and productivity. We performed a two-wave longitudinal
study involving almost 200 globally carefully selected software professionals,
inferring daily activities with perceived well-being, productivity, and other
relevant psychological and social variables. Results suggest that the time
software engineers spent doing specific activities from home was similar when
working in the office. However, we also found some significant mean
differences. The amount of time developers spent on each activity was unrelated
to their well-being, perceived productivity, and other variables. We conclude
that working remotely is not per se a challenge for organizations or
developers.

  glimpse of the carbon-free future","The COVID-19 pandemic led to partial or total lockdowns in several countries
during the first half of 2020, which in turn caused a depressed electricity
demand. In Great Britain (GB), this low demand combined with large renewable
output at times, created conditions that were not expected until renewable
capacity increases to meet emissions targets in coming years. The GB system
experienced periods of very high instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous
renewables, compromising system stability due to the lack of inertia in the
grid. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the consequences of the lockdown on
the GB electricity system is provided, focusing on the ancillary services
procured to guarantee stability. Ancillary-services costs increased by
{\pounds}200m in the months of May to July 2020 compared to the same period in
2019 (a threefold increase), highlighting the importance of ancillary services
in low-carbon systems. Furthermore, a frequency-secured scheduling model is
used in the present paper to showcase the future trends that GB is expected to
experience, as penetration of renewables increases on the road to net-zero
emissions by 2050. Several sensitivities are considered, demonstrating that the
share of total operating costs represented by ancillary services could reach
35%.

recent years. Yet, the practical model production and further research of deep
face recognition are in great need of corresponding public support. For
example, the production of face representation network desires a modular
training scheme to consider the proper choice from various candidates of
state-of-the-art backbone and training supervision subject to the real-world
face recognition demand; for performance analysis and comparison, the standard
and automatic evaluation with a bunch of models on multiple benchmarks will be
a desired tool as well; besides, a public groundwork is welcomed for deploying
the face recognition in the shape of holistic pipeline. Furthermore, there are
some newly-emerged challenges, such as the masked face recognition caused by
the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, which draws increasing attention in
practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an
easy-to-use unified framework to meet the above demands. To this end, we
introduce a novel open-source framework, named FaceX-Zoo, which is oriented to
the research-development community of face recognition. Resorting to the highly
modular and scalable design, FaceX-Zoo provides a training module with various
supervisory heads and backbones towards state-of-the-art face recognition, as
well as a standardized evaluation module which enables to evaluate the models
in most of the popular benchmarks just by editing a simple configuration. Also,
a simple yet fully functional face SDK is provided for the validation and
primary application of the trained models. Rather than including as many as
possible of the prior techniques, we enable FaceX-Zoo to easily upgrade and
extend along with the development of face related domains. The source code and

  Argentina and forecasting mental health and emotions","Purpose. We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and
emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based
on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits
anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.
Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which
link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines
for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation
with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support
their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for
the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series
forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the
emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders
can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when
limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).
Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict
mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective
level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a
forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or
group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe
that this work contributes to a better understanding of how psychological
processes related to crisis manifest in social media, being a valuable asset
for the design, implementation and monitoring of health prevention and
communication policies.

the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. It is extraordinarily difficult, however, to
deduce a generalized framework to assess the relative airborne transmission
risk with respect to other modes. This is due to the complex biophysics
entailed in such phenomena. Since the SARS outbreak in 2002, Computational
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been one of the main tools scientists used to
investigate AT of respiratory viruses. Now, CFD simulations produce intuitive
and physically plausible colour-coded results that help scientists understand
SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission patterns. In addition to validation
requirements, for any CFD model to be of epistemic value to the scientific
community; it must be reproducible. In 2020, more than 45 published studies
investigated SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission in different scenarios using CFD.
Here, I systematically review the published CFD studies of COVID-19 and discuss
their reproducibility criteria with respect to the CFD modeling process. Using
a Weighted Scoring Model (WSM), I propose a novel reproducibility index for CFD
simulations of SARS-CoV-2 AT. The proposed index $(0 \leq R^{CFD}_j \leq 1)$
relies on three reproducibility criteria comprising 10 elements that represent
the possibility of a CFD study (j) to be reproduced. Frustratingly, only 3 of
23 studies (13%) achieved full reproducibility index $(R^{CFD}_j\geq 0.9)$
while the remaining 87% were found generally irreproducible $(R^{CFD}_j<0.9)$.
Without reproducible models, the scientific benefit of CFD simulations will
remain hindered, fragmented and limited. In conclusion, I call the scientific
community to apply more rigorous measures on reporting and publishing CFD
simulations in COVID-19 research.

model is the possibility to explore different testing approaches -- in

to past research which indicates that conservatives are more rule abiding,
prefer to avoid loss, and are more prevention-motivated than liberals. We
reconcile this disconnect between recent empirical findings and past research
by using insights gathered from press releases, millions of tweets, and
mobility data capturing local movement in retail, grocery, workplace, parks,

conservatives adhere to health directives when they express more fear of the

led to significant budget deficits due to dramatic decreases in fare revenues.
Additionally, public transit agencies are facing challenges of reduced vehicle
capacity due to social distancing requirements, additional costs of cleaning
and protective equipment, and increased downtime for vehicle cleaning. Due to
these constraints on resources and budgets, many transit agencies have adopted
essential service plans with reduced service hours, number of routes, or
frequencies.
  This paper studies the resiliency during a pandemic of On-Demand Multimodal
Transit Systems (ODMTS), a new generation of transit systems that combine a
network of high-frequency trains and buses with on-demand shuttles to serve the
first and last miles and act as feeders to the fixed network. It presents a
case study for the city of Atlanta and evaluates ODMTS for multiple scenarios
of depressed demand and social distancing representing various stages of the
pandemic. The case study relies on a real data from the Metropolitan Atlanta
Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), an optimization pipeline for the design of
ODMTS, and a detailed simulation of these designs. The case study demonstrates
how ODMTS provide a resilient solution in terms of cost, convenience, and
accessibility for this wide range of scenarios.

COVID-19. Machine learning methods can be employed to train models from labeled
CT images and predict whether a case is positive or negative. However, there
exists no publicly-available and large-scale CT data to train accurate models.
In this work, we propose a multi-stage attentive transfer learning framework
for improving COVID-19 diagnosis. Our proposed framework consists of three
stages to train accurate diagnosis models through learning knowledge from
multiple source tasks and data of different domains. Importantly, we propose a
novel self-supervised learning method to learn multi-scale representations for
lung CT images. Our method captures semantic information from the whole lung
and highlights the functionality of each lung region for better representation
learning. The method is then integrated to the last stage of the proposed
transfer learning framework to reuse the complex patterns learned from the same
CT images. We use a base model integrating self-attention (ATTNs) and
convolutional operations. Experimental results show that networks with ATTNs
induce greater performance improvement through transfer learning than networks
without ATTNs. This indicates attention exhibits higher transferability than
convolution. Our results also show that the proposed self-supervised learning
method outperforms several baseline methods.

transmissibility and high pathogenicity seriously threaten people's lives, it
is crucial to accurately and quickly detect COVID-19 infection. Many recent
studies have shown that deep learning (DL) based solutions can help detect
COVID-19 based on chest CT scans. However, most existing work focuses on 2D
datasets, which may result in low quality models as the real CT scans are 3D

datasets with a relatively unfair comparison. In this paper, we first use three
state-of-the-art 3D models (ResNet3D101, DenseNet3D121, and MC3\_18) to
establish the baseline performance on the three publicly available chest CT
scan datasets. Then we propose a differentiable neural architecture search
(DNAS) framework to automatically search for the 3D DL models for 3D chest CT

efficiency. We further exploit the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) technique on
our models to provide the interpretability of the results. The experimental
results show that our automatically searched models (CovidNet3D) outperform the
baseline human-designed models on the three datasets with tens of times smaller
model size and higher accuracy. Furthermore, the results also verify that CAM
can be well applied in CovidNet3D for COVID-19 datasets to provide

  and Quarantine Measures by a ""Kinetic-Type Reactions"" Approach","We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic
subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the
time-delay for recovery or death processes. The dynamic equations for the
entire process are derived by adopting a kinetic-type reaction approach. More
specifically, the lockdown and the quarantine measures are modelled by some
kind of inhibitor reactions where susceptible and infected individuals can be
trapped into inactive states. The dynamics for the recovered people is obtained
by accounting people who are only traced back to hospitalised infected people.
To get the evolution equation we take inspiration from the Michaelis- Menten
enzyme-substrate reaction model (the so-called MM reaction) where the enzyme is
associated to the available hospital beds, the substrate to the infected
people, and the product to the recovered people, respectively. In other words,
everything happens as if the hospitals beds act as a catalyser in the hospital
recovery process. Of course, in our case the reverse MM reactions has no sense
in our case and, consequently, the kinetic constant is equal to zero. Finally,
the O.D.E.s for people tested positive to COVID-19 is simply modelled by the
following kinetic scheme S+I=>2I with I=>R or I=>D, with S, I, R, and D
denoting the compartments Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased
people, respectively. The resulting kinetic-type equation} provide the O.D.E.s,

the total number of the recovered people previously hospitalised, subject to

carried out on real data for Belgium, France and Germany confirmed the
correctness of our model.

  timescales: the case of Italy","A great issue of discussion of an infectious disease is its basic
reproduction number R0, which provides an estimation of the contagiousness of
the disease. When R0 > 1, the disease spread will potentially lead to an
outbreak, such that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics. During the evolution of
an outbreak, various non-pharmaceutical interventions are employed, the impact
of which is frequently assessed by the reduction that they introduce to the
effective reproduction number Rt; reduction below 1 is an indication of
eventual dying out of the disease spread. Motivated by the fact that R0
essentially expresses the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, in this
work, Rt was examined in the view of timescale analysis. It was shown that
during the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, when various
interventions were in place, Rt had a clear relation with the explosive
timescale characterizing the dynamics of the outbreak. In particular, it is
shown that the existence of an explosive timescale during the progression of
the epidemics implies Rt > 1, while its absence implies Rt < 1. In addition, as
this timescale converges/diverges with the immediately slowest one, Rt
approaches to/withdraws from its threshold value 1. These results suggest that
timescale analysis can be utilized for the assessment of the impact of various
interventions, since it reflects the insight provided by the effective
reproduction number, without being hindered by the selection of the population
model, nor the parameter estimation process followed for model calibration.

hypothesis is supported by studies that have shown: (i) respiratory viruses
interact with TRPA1 and TRPV1 on sensory nerves and epithelial cells in the

processes to the stream of data, we find that disorder events are

Considerable diversity is observed among countries when computing correlations

specific political, societal and geographic characteristics. Israel, the most
territorially compact and where large scale protests were coordinated in
response to government lockdowns, displays the largest reactivity and the

artificial intelligence models provide effective mechanisms in uncovering early

people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics.
Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased
within the 28 days and also negative feelings related to friends dying and

impact public health policy decisions through monitoring trends of emotional
feelings of those who are quarantined. The framework presented here has
potential to assist in such monitoring by using as an online emotion detection

  now-casting models","Online searches have been used to study different health-related behaviours,
including monitoring disease outbreaks. An obvious caveat is that several
reasons can motivate individuals to seek online information and models that are
blind to people's motivations are of limited use and can even mislead. This is
particularly true during extraordinary public health crisis, such as the
ongoing pandemic, when fear, curiosity and many other reasons can lead
individuals to search for health-related information, masking the
disease-driven searches. However, health crisis can also offer an opportunity
to disentangle between different drivers and learn about human behavior. Here,
we focus on the two pandemics of the 21st century (2009-H1N1 flu and Covid-19)
and propose a methodology to discriminate between search patterns linked to
general information seeking (media driven) and search patterns possibly more
associated with actual infection (disease driven). We show that by learning
from such pandemic periods, with high anxiety and media hype, it is possible to
select online searches and improve model performance both in pandemic and
seasonal settings. Moreover, and despite the common claim that more data is
always better, our results indicate that lower volume of the right data can be
better than including large volumes of apparently similar data, especially in
the long run. Our work provides a general framework that can be applied beyond
specific events and diseases, and argues that algorithms can be improved simply
by using less (better) data. This has important consequences, for example, to
solve the accuracy-explainability trade-off in machine-learning.

  COVID-19 patients on an Indian cohort","Many countries are now experiencing the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
straining the healthcare resources with an acute shortage of hospital beds and
ventilators for the critically ill patients. This situation is especially worse
in India with the second largest load of COVID-19 cases and a relatively
resource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to
triage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources
towards critically ill patients. Yan et al. 1 have published a very pertinent
research that uses Machine learning (ML) methods to predict the outcome of
COVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at the day of admission.
They used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the
mortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the
sequential addition of multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable
decision rule was obtained from a 'single-tree XGBoost' and used lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) values. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81%
mortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges
and do not provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other
populations as has been reported in the ""Matters Arising"" section of Yan et al.
Here, we show the limitations of this model by deploying it on one of the
largest datasets of COVID-19 patients containing detailed clinical parameters
collected from India.

substantial harm to health and economies around the world. Motivated by the use
of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective
complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a
neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as
part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting
factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient
cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural
networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest
quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature.
We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a
multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage
explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2,
with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two
board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience,
respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19

97.9%/95.7%/96.4%/98.9%/98.7%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance
validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent
with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant
critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of
deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19

  Testbed for Sustainable and Innovative Environments (ETSIE) using Fuzzy
  Cognitive Maps","This paper sketches a new approach using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) to
operably map and simulate digital transformation in architecture and urban
planning. Today these processes are poorly understood. Many current studies on
digital transformation are only treating questions of economic efficiency.
Sustainability and social impact only play a minor role. Decisive definitions,
concepts and terms stay unclear. Therefore this paper develops an open
experimental testbed for sustainable and innovative environments (ETSIE) for
three different digital transformation scenarios using FCMs. A traditional
growth-oriented scenario, a COVID-19 scenario and an innovative and sustainable
COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same
number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the
initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted
differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis.
The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one
of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It
is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very
similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to
accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does
not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development.
Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections
an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible.

demand side of an economy. A striking recent example is the Covid-19 pandemic
which has created severe industry-specific disruptions to economic output in
most countries. Since firms are embedded in production networks, these direct
shocks to supply and demand will propagate downstream and upstream. We show
that existing input-output models which allow for binding demand and supply
constraints yield infeasible solutions when applied to pandemic shocks of three
major European countries (Germany, Italy, Spain). We then introduce a
mathematical optimization procedure which is able to determine best-case
feasible market allocations, giving a lower bound on total shock propagation.
We find that even in this best-case scenario network effects substantially
amplify the initial shocks. To obtain more realistic model predictions, we
study the propagation of shocks bottom-up by imposing different rationing rules
on firms if they are not able to satisfy incoming demand. Our results show that
overall economic impacts depend strongly on the emergence of input bottlenecks,
making the rationing assumption a key variable in predicting adverse economic
impacts. We further establish that the magnitude of initial shocks and network
density heavily influence model predictions.

  The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic","We investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual
reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that
this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on
constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported
infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time
behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we
extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German
health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the
variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast
to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting
rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better
understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the
individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction
of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of
different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are
accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic
in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction
number.

conducted a quantitative survey to develop a precise understanding of the

approaches, including one where fans gathered at a venue but were isolated from
the idol member by an acrylic plate and talked via a video call. Then the
interviews not only provided answers to why such an approach would be
reasonable but also suggested the existence of a large gap between conventional
offline events and emerging online events in their perceptions. Based on the
results, I discussed how we can develop interaction techniques to support this
transition and how we can apply it to other situations outside idol culture,

these can also be derived as particular cases of our formulation. The model
also allows estimation of the number of infections over time in the absence of

the absence of sufficient mitigation measures. We also derive optimal control
strategies for distinct mitigation costs and evaluate the effect of these costs

that relaxations in the mitigation measures cause a rapid increase in the

data through internet surveys to construct short panel data from mid-March to

affected. (3) Surprisingly, workers whose children are primary school pupils
are most likely to support promotion of working from home after schools reopen.
Due to school closure and a lack of after-school care, parents need to work
from home, and this experience motivated workers with small children to
continue doing so to improve work-life balance even after schools reopen.

clinical science, and with it the possibility that data could be shared, to
multiply insights beyond what investigators could abstract from paper records.
The need to share individual-level medical data to accelerate innovation in
precision medicine continues to grow, and has never been more urgent, as
scientists grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enthusiasm for the use
of big data has been tempered by a fully appropriate concern for patient
autonomy and privacy. That is, the ability to extract private or confidential
information about an individual, in practice, renders it difficult to share
data, since significant infrastructure and data governance must be established
before data can be shared. Although HIPAA provided de-identification as an
approved mechanism for data sharing, linkage attacks were identified as a major
vulnerability. A variety of mechanisms have been established to avoid leaking
private information, such as field suppression or abstraction, strictly
limiting the amount of information that can be shared, or employing
mathematical techniques such as differential privacy. Another approach, which
we focus on here, is creating synthetic data that mimics the underlying data.
For synthetic data to be a useful mechanism in support of medical innovation
and a proxy for real-world evidence, one must demonstrate two properties of the
synthetic dataset: (1) any analysis on the real data must be matched by
analysis of the synthetic data (statistical fidelity) and (2) the synthetic
data must preserve privacy, with minimal risk of re-identification (privacy
guarantee). In this paper we propose a framework for quantifying the
statistical fidelity and privacy preservation properties of synthetic datasets
and demonstrate these metrics for synthetic data generated by Syntegra
technology.

model is added; it allows a better comparison to other models. We carry this
out by a comparison with the classical SIR model and indicate why we believe
that the SEPAR$_d$ model may work better for Covid-19 than other approaches. In
the second part of the paper we explain how to deal with the data provided by
the JHU, in particular we explain how to derive central model parameters from
the data. Other parameters, like the size of the dark sector, are less
accessible and have to be estimated more roughly, at best by results of
representative serological studies which are accessible, however, only for a
few countries. We start our country studies with Switzerland where such data
are available. Then we apply the model to a collection of other countries,
three European ones (Germany, France, Sweden), the three most stricken
countries from three other continents (USA, Brazil, India). Finally we show
that even the aggregated world data can be well represented by our approach. At

theoretical properties of the models are investigated and asymptotic
consistency is proven. Two real world applications to Covid-19 mortality in the

patient population into Asymptomatic and Infected, we have explicitly accounted

the devices' driving ability, which can be eliminated with carefully engineered

information on a social networking service (SNS) is unknown, and false
information can be easily spread. Consequently, many studies have been
conducted on methods to control the spread of misinformation on social
networking sites. However, few studies have examined the impact of the spread
of misinformation and its corrections on society. This study models the impact
of the reduction of misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information
on social disruption, and it identifies the features of this impact. In this
study, we analyzed misinformation regarding the shortage of toilet paper during
the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, its corrections, and the excessive purchasing
caused by this information. First, we analyze the amount of misinformation and
corrective information spread on SNS, and we create a regression model to
estimate the real-world impact of misinformation and its correction. This model
is used to analyze the change in real-world impact corresponding to the change
in the diffusion of misinformation and corrective information. Our analysis
shows that the corrective information was spread to a much greater extent than
the misinformation. In addition, our model reveals that the corrective
information was what caused the excessive purchasing behavior. As a result of
our further analysis, we found that the amount of diffusion of corrective
information required to minimize the impact on the real world depends on the
amount of the diffusion of misinformation.

Furthermore, initial statistical analyses also indicate a gender difference in
mean gains in favour of females at the 95% significance level (for paired data,

were aware of their conceptual performance in physics, and the main constraint
to their studies was due to difficulties associated with being online. As such,
the change in pedagogy and the stresses of lockdown were found to not be
suggestive of a depreciation of FCI gains and grades.

defined in terms of the relative risk or the ratio of two disease risks.
However, only approximate methods are available for estimating the variance of
the relative risk. In this article, we show using a probabilistic model that
uncertainty in the efficacy rate could be underestimated when the disease risk
is low. Factoring in the baseline rate of the disease, we estimate broader
confidence intervals for the efficacy rates of the vaccines recently developed
for COVID-19. We propose new confidence intervals for the relative risk. We
further show that sample sizes required for phase 3 efficacy trials are
routinely underestimated and propose a new method for sample size calculation
where the efficacy is of interest. We also discuss the deleterious effects of
classification bias which is particularly relevant at low disease prevalence.

multi-week, multi-site observational study was undertaken outside of 19 New
York City medical facilities during the peak of the city's initial COVID-19
wave (03/22/20-05/19/20). The aim was to capture perishable data of the touch,
destination choice, and PPE usage behavior of individuals egressing hospitals
and urgent care centers. A major goal was to establish an empirical basis for
future research on the way people interact with three-dimensional vector
environments. Anonymized data were collected via smart phones. Each data record
includes the time, data, and location of an individual leaving a healthcare
facility, their routing, interactions with the build environment, other
individuals, and themselves. Most records also note their PPE usage,
destination, intermediary stops, and transportation choices. The records were
linked with 61 socio-economic factors by the facility zip code and 7
contemporaneous weather factors and the merged in a unified shapefile in an

been forced to stay home weeks. They have only been allowed to leave home for
fundamental needs such as food and health needs, and most started to work from
home. In this period, very few people, including essential workers, had to
leave their homes. Avoiding social contact is proven to be the best method to

help aid faster development of the public health policy, particularly in areas
with low levels of testing and having a greater reliance on self-reported

Research Council, 2010), it was suggested that having to move so frequently
which is a career necessity may be unattractive to people wanting to start a
family, especially impacting women. Whether in Europe or elsewhere, as
postdocs, astrophysicists will relocate every two to three years, until they
secure a permanent position or leave research altogether. Astrophysicists do
perceive working abroad as important and positive for their careers (Parenti,
2002); however, it was found that the men at equal rank had not had to spend as
much time abroad to further their careers (Fohlmeister & Helling, 2012). By
implication, women need to work abroad longer or have more positions abroad to
achieve the same rank as men. Astrophysicists living in the United Kingdom
prefer to work in their country of origin, but many did not do so because of
worse working conditions or difficultly finding a job for their spouse
(Fohlmeister & Helling, 2014). In sum, mobility and moving is necessary for a
career in astrophysics, and even more necessary for women, but astrophysicists
prefer not to move as frequently as needed to maintain a research career. To

  interconnected economy","Using network analysis, this paper develops a multidimensional methodological
framework for understanding the uneven (cross-country) spread of COVID-19 in
the context of the global interconnected economy. The globally interconnected
system of tourism mobility is modeled as a complex network, where two main
stages in the temporal spread of COVID-19 are revealed and defined by the
cutting-point of the 44th day from Wuhan. The first stage describes the
outbreak in Asia and North America, the second one in Europe, South America,
and Africa, while the outbreak in Oceania is spread along both stages. The
analysis shows that highly connected nodes in the global tourism network (GTN)
are infected early by the pandemic, while nodes of lower connectivity are late
infected. Moreover, countries with the same network centrality as China were
early infected on average by COVID-19. The paper also finds that network
interconnectedness, economic openness, and transport integration are key
determinants in the early global spread of the pandemic, and it reveals that
the spatio-temporal patterns of the worldwide spread of COVID-19 are more a
matter of network interconnectivity than of spatial proximity.

with hobbyist equipment and online social networks could emulate using
industrial equipment in shared workshops. Furthermore, at-home digital
fabrication offered unique learning opportunities including more iteration,
machine tuning, and maintenance. These opportunities depended on new forms of
labor and varied based on student living situations. Our findings have
implications for remote and in-person digital fabrication instruction. They
indicate how access to tools was important, but not as critical as providing
opportunities for iteration; they show how remote fabrication exacerbated
student inequities; and they suggest strategies for evaluating trade-offs in
remote fabrication models with respect to learning objectives.

impacts of Covid-19 and Brexit on UK horticultural businesses. Various
characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and
import dependence, make it an important sector for policymakers concerned to
understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into
2021. The study design prioritised timeliness, using a rapid survey to gather
information from a relatively small (n = 19) but indicative group of producers.
The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority
of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been
unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also
add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply
challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses
the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and
automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although
automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry
(89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option
(32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently,
automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK's horticultural
workforce shortage due to economic and socio-political uncertainties. The
conclusion highlights policy recommendations and future investigative
intentions, as well as suggesting methodological and other discussion points

telecommunication for remote learning/working and telemedicine has
significantly increased. In this context, preserving high Quality of Service
(QoS) and maintaining low latency communication are of paramount importance.
Development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-aided heterogeneous cellular
network is a promising solution to satisfy the aforementioned requirements.
There are, however, key challenges ahead, on the one hand, it is challenging to
optimally increase content diversity in caching nodes to mitigate the network's
traffic over the backhaul. On the other hand is the challenge of attenuated
UAVs' signal in indoor environments, which increases users' access delay and
UAVs' energy consumption. To address these challenges, we incorporate UAVs, as
mobile caching nodes, together with Femto Access points (FAPs) to increase the
network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments. Referred to as the
Cluster-centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework, a two-phase
clustering framework is proposed for optimal FAPs' formation and UAVs'
deployment. The proposed CCUF leads to an increase in the cache diversity, a
reduction in the users' access delay, and significant reduction in UAVs' energy
consumption. To mitigate the inter-cell interference in edge areas, the
Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) approach is integrated within the CCUF
framework. In contrary to existing works, we analytically compute the optimal
number of FAPs in each cluster to increase the cache-hit probability of coded
content placement. Furthermore, the optimal number of coded contents to be
stored in each caching node is computed to increase the cache-hit-ratio,
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), and cache diversity and
decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content
popularity profiles.

especially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot

the particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets

between the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol
levels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol

applied Machine Learning algorithms for COVID-19 diagnosis over chest X-ray

from 14 different thoracic diseases and healthy subjects. To accomplish this,
we have compiled the largest COVID-19 CXR dataset: QaTa-COV19 with 124,616

social activity into traditional epidemiological models. The overall epidemic
dynamics is condensed to three differential equations and is characterized by
an emergent long timescale. Our model captures multiple features of real-life
epidemics such as COVID-19, including prolonged plateaus and multiple waves.
Individual waves are suppressed at the state of Transient Collective Immunity

mainly decided by top exporters. Export restrictions exacerbate the shortages
of PPE and cause the shortage contagion to transmit even faster than the

in drug discovery. The fast expansion of available biological data enables
computational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them,
deep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as
protein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement
by learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and
drug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally
obtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational
methods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that
hamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel
supervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby
improve the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In
this research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI.
BridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different
proteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised
learned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end
learning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of
DPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies verify the
effectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification,
BridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19's proteins and various
antiviral drugs. And the predictive results accord with the statement of the
World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration, showing the
validity and reliability of BridgeDPI.

has been a major roadblock in achieving predictability in the spread and
containment of the disease. In addition to understanding the modes of
transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be
built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such
complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead
to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease.
The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent
of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies,
population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model -- the
Blue Sky model -- and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be
explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In
addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in
the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized
in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The
methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission
of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The
predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology
can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during
a pandemic.

probability of requiring mechanical ventilation. A challenge in the risk
prediction for COVID-19 patients lies in the great variability and irregular
sampling of patient's vitals and labs observed in the clinical setting.
Existing methods have strong limitations in handling time-dependent features'
complex dynamics, either oversimplifying temporal data with summary statistics
that lose information or over-engineering features that lead to less robust
outcomes. We propose a novel in-time risk trajectory predictive model to handle
the irregular sampling rate in the data, which follows the dynamics of risk of
performing mechanical ventilation for individual patients. The model
incorporates the Multi-task Gaussian Process using observed values to learn the
posterior joint multi-variant conditional probability and infer the missing
values on a unified time grid. The temporal imputed data is fed into a
multi-objective self-attention network for the prediction task. A novel
positional encoding layer is proposed and added to the network for producing
in-time predictions. The positional layer outputs a risk score at each
user-defined time point during the entire hospital stay of an inpatient. We
frame the prediction task into a multi-objective learning framework, and the
risk scores at all time points are optimized altogether, which adds robustness
and consistency to the risk score trajectory prediction. Our experimental
evaluation on a large database with nationwide in-hospital patients with

The data exhibit a clear sinusoidal behavior, whose fit allows for a robust
subtraction of the baseline trend of casualties in Italy, with a surplus of
mortality in correspondence to the flu epidemics in winter and to the hottest
periods in summer. While these peaks are symmetric in shape, the peak in
coincidence with the COVID-19 pandemics is asymmetric and more pronounced. We
fit the former with a Gaussian function and the latter with a Gompertz
function, in order to quantify number of casualties, the duration and the
position of all causes of excess deaths. The overall quality of the fit to the
data turns out to be very good. We discuss the trend of casualties in Italy by
different classes of ages and for the different genders. We finally compare the
data-subtracted casualties as reported by ISTAT with those reported by the
Italian Department for Civil Protection (DPC) relative to the deaths directly
attributed to COVID-19, and we discuss the differences.

pattern of a patient is crucial to respiratory rehabilitation therapies such as
magnetic resonance exams for respiratory-triggered imaging, chronic pulmonary
disease treatment, and synchronized functional electrical stimulation. While
numerous respiratory devices have been developed, they are often in direct
contact with a patient, which can yield inaccurate or limited data. In this
study, we developed a novel, non-invasive, and contactless magnetic sensing
platform that can precisely monitor breathing, movement, or sleep patterns of a
patient, thus providing efficient monitoring at a clinic or home. A magneto-LC
resonance (MLCR) sensor converts the magnetic oscillations generated by
breathing of the patient into an impedance spectrum, which allows for a deep
analysis of breath variation to identify respiratory-related diseases like
COVID-19. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity, the MLCR sensor yields a distinct
breathing pattern for each patient tested. The sensor also provides an accurate
measure of the strength of breath at multiple stages as well as anomalous
variations in respiratory rate and amplitude. This suggests that the MLCR
sensor can detect symptoms of COVID-19 in a patient due to shortness of breath
or difficulty breathing as well as track the progress of the disease in real
time.

  and Emotion Recognition","The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
models for different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and for sentiment
analysis in particular, has become very popular in recent years and not in
vain. The use of social media is being constantly on the rise. Its impact on
all areas of our lives is almost inconceivable. Researches show that social
media nowadays serves as one of the main tools where people freely express
their ideas, opinions, and emotions. During the current Covid-19 pandemic, the
role of social media as a tool to resonate opinions and emotions, became even
more prominent.
  This paper introduces HeBERT and HebEMO. HeBERT is a transformer-based model
for modern Hebrew text. Hebrew is considered a Morphological Rich Language
(MRL), with unique characteristics that pose a great challenge in developing
appropriate Hebrew NLP models. Analyzing multiple specifications of the BERT
architecture, we come up with a language model that outperforms all existing
Hebrew alternatives on multiple language tasks.
  HebEMO is a tool that uses HeBERT to detect polarity and extract emotions
from Hebrew user-generated content (UGC), which was trained on a unique
Covid-19 related dataset that we collected and annotated for this study. Data
collection and annotation followed an innovative iterative semi-supervised
process that aimed to maximize predictability. HebEMO yielded a high
performance of weighted average F1-score = 0.96 for polarity classification.
Emotion detection reached an F1-score of 0.78-0.97, with the exception of
\textit{surprise}, which the model failed to capture (F1 = 0.41). These results
are better than the best-reported performance, even when compared to the
English language.

  Prevention and Treatment","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused global disruption and a
significant loss of life. Existing treatments that can be repurposed as
prophylactic and therapeutic agents could reduce the pandemic's devastation.
Emerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has
led to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for
COVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical
investigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding
dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of
COVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based
recommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant
role in patient outcomes, and these products could help alleviate deficiencies.
For example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated
with greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that
vitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing
number of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D
supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin
D and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the
extent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in
the COVID-19 crisis.

with 300 inhabitants in each block. The mobility pattern is associated to a
complex network in which nodes represent blocks while the links represent the
traveling path of the individuals. We implemented three confinement strategies
in order to mitigate the disease spreading: 1) global confinement, 2) partial
restriction to mobility, and 3) localized confinement. In the first case, it
was observed that a global isolation policy prevents the massive outbreak of
the disease. In the second case, a partial restriction to mobility could lead
to a massive contagion if this was not complemented with sanitary measures such
as the use of masks and social distancing. Finally, a local isolation policy
was proposed, conditioned to the health status of each block. It was observed
that this mitigation strategy was able to contain and even reduce the outbreak
of the disease by intervening in specific regions of the city according to
their level of contagion. It was also observed that this strategy is capable of
controlling the epidemic in the case that a certain proportion of those
infected are asymptomatic.

from vaccinations, masks and social distancing against the pandemic, to
household best practices against climate change, to acceptance of future 5G
towers nearby. Here we show how a strengthening of bonds across online
communities during the pandemic, has led to non-Covid-19 conspiracy theories
(e.g. fluoride, chemtrails, 5G) attaining heightened access to mainstream
parent communities. Alternative health communities act as the critical conduits
between conspiracy theorists and parents, and make the narratives more
palatable to the latter. We demonstrate experimentally that these
inter-community bonds can perpetually generate new misinformation, irrespective
of any changes in factual information. Our findings show explicitly why
Facebook's current policies have failed to stop the mainstreaming of
non-Covid-19 and Covid-19 conspiracy theories and misinformation, and why
targeting the largest communities will not work. A simple yet exactly solvable
and empirically grounded mathematical model, shows how modest tailoring of
mainstream communities' couplings could prevent them from tipping against
establishment guidance. Our conclusions should also apply to other social media

explicitly in response to COVID-19 from 24 Jan, 2020, to 23 Jan, 2021, in 48
countries. The analysis was guided by four overarching questions: 1) What were
robots used for in the COVID-19 response? 2) When were they used? 3) How did
different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics
influence a country's innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The
findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work
domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the
country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of
their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the
data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to
NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note
that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly
modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases
constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries
with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often

from this analysis are expected to be of value to the robotics and robotics
policy community in preparing robots for rapid insertion into future disasters.

the World Health Organisation (WHO) about 4.2 million people die annually due

people died during 2020 and 96.2 million people got affected by this
devastating disease. Recent research shows that applying individual
interactions and movements data could help managing the pandemic though
modelling the spread of infectious diseases on social contact networks.
Infectious disease spreading can be explained with the theories and methods of
diffusion processes where a dynamic phenomena evolves on networked systems. In
the modelling of diffusion process, it is assumed that contagious items spread
out in the networked system through the inter-node interactions. This resembles
spreading of infectious virus, e.g. spread of COVID-19, within a population
through individual social interactions. The evolution behaviours of the
diffusion process are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the
underlying system and the mechanism of the diffusion process itself. Thus,
spreading of infectious disease can be explained how people interact with each
other and by the characteristics of the disease itself. This paper presenters
the relevant theories and methodologies of diffusion process that can be used
to model the spread of infectious diseases.

submit their forecasts weekly to the CDC. It is not possible to declare whether
one method is better than the other using those forecasts because each team's
submission may correspond to different techniques over the period and involve
human interventions as the teams are continuously changing/tuning their
approach. Such forecasts may be considered ""human-expert"" forecasts and do not
qualify as AI/ML approaches, although they can be used as an indicator of human
expert performance. We are interested in supporting AI/ML research in epidemic
forecasting which can lead to scalable forecasting without human intervention.
Which modeling technique, learning strategy, and data pre-processing technique

little known that there is also a low carbon shift of the global energy system
in 2020. Here, using the near-real-time data on energy-related GHG emissions
from 30 countries (about 70% of global power generation), we show that the
pandemic caused an unprecedented de-carbonization of global power system,
representing by a dramatic decrease in the carbon intensity of power sector
that reached a historical low of 414.9 tCO2eq/GWh in 2020. Moreover, the share
of energy derived from renewable and low-carbon sources (nuclear, hydro-energy,
wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) exceeded that from coal and oil for the
first time in history in May of 2020. The decrease in global net energy demand
(-1.3% in the first half of 2020 relative to the average of the period in
2016-2019) masks a large down-regulation of fossil-fuel-burning power plants
supply (-6.1%) coincident with a surge of low-carbon sources (+6.2%).
Concomitant changes in the diurnal cycle of electricity demand also favored
low-carbon generators, including a flattening of the morning ramp, a lower
midday peak, and delays in both the morning and midday load peaks in most
countries. However, emission intensities in the power sector have since
rebounded in many countries, and a key question for climate mitigation is thus
to what extent countries can achieve and maintain lower, pandemic-level carbon
intensities of electricity as part of a green recovery.

domain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the
antibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19
and evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose
a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to
ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to
ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol,
which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol,
respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the
example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD,
which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the
framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main
driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational
alanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally efficient
and numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2

its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution
for face recognition and classification of correct mask wearing and

can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping areas, and
other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application
scenarios impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The
inference hardware must be cheap, small and energy efficient, while providing
sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate CNNs at a reasonably
low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain
on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address
these challenges, we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for
correct facial-mask wear and positioning. The classification task is
implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary operations.
Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling
multi-camera, speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings.
When deployed on a single entrance or gate, the idle power consumption is
reduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device. We achieve an
accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset.

For instance, in handling pandemic diseases such as the recent Covid-19
outbreak and other outbreaks like Ebola, robots can assist in reaching areas
dangerous for humans and do simple tasks such as pick up the correct medicine
(among a set of bottles prescribed) and deliver to patients. In such cases, it
might not be good to rely on the fully autonomous operation of robots. Since
many mobile robots are fully functional with low-level tasks such as grabbing
and moving, we consider the mixed-initiative control where the user can guide
the robot remotely to finish such tasks. For this mixed-initiative control, the
user controlling the robot needs to visualize a 3D scene as seen by the robot
and guide it. Mixed reality can virtualize reality and immerse users in the 3D
scene that is reconstructed from the real-world environment. This technique
provides the user more freedom such as choosing viewpoints at view time. In
recent years, benefiting from the high-quality data from Light Detection and
Ranging (LIDAR) and RGBD cameras, mixed reality is widely used to build
networked platforms to improve the performance of robot teleoperations and
robot-human collaboration, and enhanced feedback for mixed-initiative control.
In this paper, we proposed a novel haptic-enabled mixed reality system, that
provides haptic interfaces to interact with the virtualized environments and
give remote guidance for mobile robots towards high-level tasks. The
experimental results show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed
haptic enabled mixed reality system.

  COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model","Motivation: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential
for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing
the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID19 tests performed in
every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect
of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in
managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce
COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that
evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and
provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should
be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a
geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused
by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as
environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation
measures.
  Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the
policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days
to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing
the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity
need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average
of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike
existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the
daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model
is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios
under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

  COVID-19 in urban neighborhoods","The rapid early spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. was experienced very
differently by different socioeconomic groups and business industries. In this
study, we study aggregate mobility patterns of New York City and Chicago to
identify the relationship between the amount of interpersonal contact between
people in urban neighborhoods and the disparity in the growth of positive cases
among these groups. We introduce an aggregate Contact Exposure Index (CEI) to
measure exposure due to this interpersonal contact and combine it with social
distancing metrics to show its effect on positive case growth. With the help of
structural equations modeling, we find that the effect of exposure on case
growth was consistently positive and that it remained consistently higher in
lower-income neighborhoods, suggesting a causal path of income on case growth
via contact exposure. Using the CEI, schools and restaurants are identified as
high-exposure industries, and the estimation suggests that implementing
specific mobility restrictions on these point-of-interest categories are most
effective. This analysis can be useful in providing insights for government
officials targeting specific population groups and businesses to reduce
infection spread as reopening efforts continue to expand across the nation.

number Rt(t) to identify the supercritical (percolative), the subcritical

mathematically characterized by i) the power law of Td vs. [Rt(t)-1] and ii)

essential problem, when millions of people are suffering from the pandemic

are two issues -- weak annotation and insufficient data that may obstruct
automatic COVID-19 severity assessment with CT images. To address these

measures effectively slowed disease transmission in many countries in Europe
and Asia, but the same benefits have not been observed in some developing
countries such as Brazil. In part, this is due to a failure to organise
systematic testing campaigns at nationwide or even regional levels. To gain
effective control of the pandemic, decision-makers in developing countries,
particularly those with large populations, must overcome difficulties posed by
an unequal distribution of wealth combined with low daily testing capacities.
The economic infrastructure of the country, often concentrated in a few cities,
forces workers to travel from commuter cities and rural areas, which induces
strong nonlinear effects on disease transmission. In the present study, we
develop a smart testing strategy to identify geographic regions where COVID-19
testing could most effectively be deployed to limit further disease
transmission. The strategy uses readily available anonymised mobility and
demographic data integrated with intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy data and
city-specific social-distancing measures. Taking into account the heterogeneity
of ICU bed occupancy in differing regions and the stages of disease evolution,
we use a data-driven study of the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo as an example to
show that smart testing strategies can rapidly limit transmission while
reducing the need for social-distancing measures, thus returning life to a
so-called new normal, even when testing capacity is limited.

spatial interactions among locations. For decades, spatial scientists have
researched place connectivity, applications, and metrics. The growing
popularity of social media provides a new data stream where spatial social
interaction measures are largely devoid of privacy issues, easily assessable,
and harmonized. In this study, we introduced a place connectivity index (PCI)
based on spatial interactions among places revealed by geotagged tweets as a
multiscale, spatiotemporal-continuous, and easy-to-implement measurement. The
proposed PCI, established and demonstrated at the US county level, exhibits a
strong positive association with SafeGraph population movement records (10
percent penetration in the US population) and Facebook's social connectedness
index (SCI), a popular connectivity index based on social networks. We found
that PCI has a strong state boundary effect and that it generally follows the
distance decay effect, although this force is weaker in more urbanized counties
with a denser population. Our investigation further suggests that PCI has great
potential in addressing real-world problems that require place connectivity
knowledge, exemplified with two applications: 1) modeling the spatial spread of
COVID-19 during the early stage of the pandemic, and 2) modeling hurricane
evacuation destination choice. The methodological and contextual knowledge of
PCI, together with the launched visualization platform and open-sourced PCI
datasets at various geographic levels, is expected to support research fields
requiring knowledge in human spatial interactions.

sources. During the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of global NO$_2$ emissions
have shown significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon this example of
NO$_2$ as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model
and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO$_2$ as an
atmospheric technosignature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like
planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO$_2$
concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars due to less
short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO$_2$. In cloud-free results,
present Earth-level NO$_2$ on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at
10pc can be detected with SNR ~5 within ~400 hours with a 15 meter LUVOIR-like
telescope when observed in the 0.2 - 0.7micron range where NO$_2$ has a strong
absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could
mimic the NO$_2$ feature. Historically, global NO$_2$ levels were 3x higher,
indicating the capability of detecting a 40-year old Earth-level civilization.
Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral signatures
of NO$_2$ on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several 100s of hours
of observation time, both due to weaker NO$_2$ absorption in this region, and
also because of masking features by dominant H$_2$O and CO$_2$ bands in the
infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at these levels could be used to
place upper limits on the prevalence of NO$_2$ as a technosignature.

almost the most urgent public health events worldwide. Computed tomography (CT)
is a significant screening tool for COVID-19 infection, and automated
segmentation of lung infection in COVID-19 CT images will greatly assist
diagnosis and health care of patients. However, accurate and automatic
segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections remains to be challenging. In this
paper we propose a dilated dual attention U-Net (D2A U-Net) for COVID-19 lesion
segmentation in CT slices based on dilated convolution and a novel dual
attention mechanism to address the issues above. We introduce a dilated
convolution module in model decoder to achieve large receptive field, which
refines decoding process and contributes to segmentation accuracy. Also, we
present a dual attention mechanism composed of two attention modules which are
inserted to skip connection and model decoder respectively. The dual attention
mechanism is utilized to refine feature maps and reduce semantic gap between
different levels of the model. The proposed method has been evaluated on
open-source dataset and outperforms cutting edges methods in semantic
segmentation. Our proposed D2A U-Net with pretrained encoder achieves a Dice
score of 0.7298 and recall score of 0.7071. Besides, we also build a simplified
D2A U-Net without pretrained encoder to provide a fair comparison with other
models trained from scratch, which still outperforms popular U-Net family
models with a Dice score of 0.7047 and recall score of 0.6626. Our experiment
results have shown that by introducing dilated convolution and dual attention
mechanism, the number of false positives is significantly reduced, which
improves sensitivity to COVID-19 lesions and subsequently brings significant
increase to Dice score.

transparency and liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the
external price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as
domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging
strategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this
risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk
Meter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior
embedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil,
Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the
financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in
addition to the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM
sovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned
countries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its
maximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the
Macro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We
then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network
behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose
the suitable market for in-vestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For
that purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies
and FRM network centrality is developed. We propose a robust and

disruptions to many aspects of normal life. An important aspect in reducing the
impact of the pandemic is to control its spread. Studies have shown that one
effective method in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 is to wear masks.
Strict mask-wearing policies have been met with not only public sensation but
also practical difficulty. We cannot hope to manually check if everyone on a
street is wearing a mask properly. Existing technology to help automate mask
checking uses deep learning models on real-time surveillance camera footages.
The current dominant method to perform real-time mask detection uses Mask-RCNN
with ResNet as the backbone. While giving good detection results, this method
is computationally intensive and its efficiency in real-time face mask
detection is not ideal. Our research proposes a new approach to mask detection
by replacing Mask-R-CNN with a more efficient model ""YOLO"" to increase the
processing speed of real-time mask detection and not compromise on accuracy.
Besides, given the small volume as well as extreme imbalance of the mask
detection datasets, we adopt a latest progress made in few-shot visual
classification, simple CNAPs, to improve the classification performance.

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide
public health crisis. When the SARS-CoV-2 enters the biological fluids in the
human body, different types of biomolecules (in particular proteins) may adsorb
on its surface and alter its infection ability. Although great efforts have
recently been devoted to the interaction of the specific antibodies with the
SARS-CoV-2, it still remains largely unknown how the other serum proteins
affect the infection of the SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we systematically
investigate the interaction of serum proteins with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by the
molecular docking and the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. It is found
that the non-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) indeed cannot effectively bind to the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD while the human serum albumin (HSA) may have some potential of
blocking its infection (to ACE2). More importantly, we find that the RBD can
cause the significant structural change of the Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), by
which SARS-CoV-2 may hijack the metabolic pathway of the ApoE to facilitate its
cell entry. The present study enhances the understanding of the role of protein
corona in the bio-behaviors of SARS-CoV-2, which may aid the more precise and
personalized treatment for COVID-19 infection in the clinic.

In addition to the accuracy requirement, early warning systems must make the
predictions early enough to give physicians enough time to intervene.
Interpretability is also one of the challenges when building such systems since
being able to justify the reasoning behind model decisions is desirable in
clinical practice. In this work, we built an interpretable model for the early
prediction of various adverse clinical events indicative of clinical
deterioration. The model is evaluated on two datasets and four clinical events.
The first dataset is collected in a predominantly COVID-19 positive population
at Stony Brook Hospital. The second dataset is the MIMIC III dataset. The model
was trained to provide early warning scores for ventilation, ICU transfer, and
mortality prediction tasks on the Stony Brook Hospital dataset and to predict
mortality and the need for vasopressors on the MIMIC III dataset. Our model
first separates each feature into multiple ranges and then uses logistic
regression with lasso penalization to select the subset of ranges for each
feature. The model training is completely automated and doesn't require expert
knowledge like other early warning scores. We compare our model to the Modified

We show that our model outperforms these models in the area under the receiver

implementations. The effective policy requires taking into account public
information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to
understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for
adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome
include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different
contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach
that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c)
transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in
suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these
challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work
on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms
of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with.
Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts,
manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally,
interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an
interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical
framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over
multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous
counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized
aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional
constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing
hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments. In comparison
with knowledge-intensive baselines, we show quick sample efficient adaptation
to new knowledge and interpretability in the learned policy, especially in a
pandemic context.

  Knowledge","Selecting causal inference models for estimating individualized treatment
effects (ITE) from observational data presents a unique challenge since the
counterfactual outcomes are never observed. The problem is challenged further
in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access
to labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that
achieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples
are available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the
predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between
the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the
model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with
identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by
existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in
the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains
to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods
under the UDA setting. In particular, we propose selecting models whose
predictions of interventions' effects satisfy known causal structures in the
target domain. Experimentally, our method selects ITE models that are more
robust to covariate shifts on several healthcare datasets, including estimating
the effect of ventilation in COVID-19 patients from different geographic
locations.

well-known solutions for data scarcity in deep learning to detect COVID-19.
These include data augmentation, transfer learning, and few-shot learning, and
unsupervised learning. We have also proposed a custom few-shot learning
approach to detect COVID-19 using siamese networks. Our experimental results
showcased that we can implement an efficient and accurate deep learning model
for COVID-19 detection by adopting the few-shot learning approaches even with

accuracy an improvement from 83% using baseline models.

  Limited Labeled COVID-19 Data","The new coronavirus has caused more than 1 million deaths and continues to
spread rapidly. This virus targets the lungs, causing respiratory distress
which can be mild or severe. The X-ray or computed tomography (CT) images of
lungs can reveal whether the patient is infected with COVID-19 or not. Many
researchers are trying to improve COVID-19 detection using artificial
intelligence. In this paper, relying on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN),
we propose a Semi-supervised Classification using Limited Labelled Data (SCLLD)
for automated COVID-19 detection. Our motivation is to develop learning method
which can cope with scenarios that preparing labelled data is time consuming or
expensive. We further improved the detection accuracy of the proposed method by
applying Sobel edge detection. The GAN discriminator output is a probability
value which is used for classification in this work. The proposed system is
trained using 10,000 CT scans collected from Omid hospital. Also, we validate
our system using the public dataset. The proposed method is compared with other
state of the art supervised methods such as Gaussian processes. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first time a COVID-19 semi-supervised detection
method is presented. Our method is capable of learning from a mixture of
limited labelled and unlabelled data where supervised learners fail due to lack
of sufficient amount of labelled data. Our semi-supervised training method
significantly outperforms the supervised training of Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) in case labelled training data is scarce. Our method has achieved
an accuracy of 99.60%, sensitivity of 99.39%, and specificity of 99.80% where
CNN (trained supervised) has achieved an accuracy of 69.87%, sensitivity of

is the match between residents and hospitals where, due to the COVID-19

a virtual format. This has drastically reduced the cost to applicants of
accepting interview offers. However, the reduction in cost is not symmetric
since applicants, not programs, bore most of the costs of in-person interviews.
We show that if doctors are willing to accept more interviews but the hospitals
do not increase the number of interviews they offer, no doctor will be better
off and potentially many doctors will be harmed. This adverse consequence
results from a mechanism we describe as interview hoarding. We prove this
analytically and characterize optimal mitigation strategies for special cases.
We use simulations to extend the insights from our analytical results to more

intuitive causal interpretation, a directed acyclic latent variable model
trained on data is generally insufficient for causal reasoning, as the required
model parameters may not be uniquely identified. In this manuscript we
demonstrate that an LVM can answer any causal query posed post-training,
provided that the query can be identified from the observed variables according
to the do-calculus rules. We show that causal reasoning can enhance a broad
class of LVM long established in the probabilistic modeling community, and
demonstrate its effectiveness on several case studies. These include a machine
learning model with multiple causes where there exists a set of latent
confounders and a mediator between the causes and the outcome variable, a study
where the identifiable causal query cannot be estimated using the front-door or
back-door criterion, a case study that captures unobserved crosstalk between
two biological signaling pathways, and a COVID-19 expert system that identifies

the primary diagnosis to prevent secondary infections and its spread from one

system along with clinical procedures for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to
prevent its spread. Artificial intelligence techniques using computed

obtain high diagnostic performance for Covid-19 diagnosis. In this study, a
fusion of convolutional neural network (CNN), support vector machine (SVM), and
Sobel filter is proposed to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. A new X-ray

filter to obtain the edges of the images. Then these images are fed to CNN deep
learning model followed by SVM classifier with ten-fold cross validation

results show that the proposed CNN-SVM with Sobel filtering (CNN-SVM+Sobel)
achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.02% in accurate detection of

mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Such models are usually defined
as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into
compartments based on qualitative characteristics, with different assumptions
about the nature and rate of transfer across compartments. Though most commonly
formulated as ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, in which the
compartments depend only on time, recent works have also focused on partial
differential equation (PDE) models, incorporating the variation of an epidemic
in space. Such research on PDE models within a Susceptible, Infected, Exposed,
Recovered, and Deceased (SEIRD) framework has led to promising results in
reproducing COVID-19 contagion dynamics. In this paper, we assess the
robustness of this modeling framework by considering different geometries over
more extended periods than in other similar studies. We first validate our code

the U.S. state of Georgia and on the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro, one of
the most impacted areas in the world. Our results show good agreement with
real-world epidemiological data in both time and space for all regions across
major areas and across three different continents, suggesting that the modeling
approach is both valid and robust.

criticism with claims that the cellular coverage, mainly available through
Long-Term Evolution (LTE), was over-reported in some areas, especially those

findings reveal significant disagreement between the crowdsourced dataset and

all domains of public and private life around the globe. The stay-at-home
movement has pushed the news audiences into social networks, which, in turn,
has become the most prolific field for receiving and sharing news updates, as
well as for public expression of opinions, concerns and feelings about the
pandemic. Public opinion is a critical aspect in analysing how the information
and events impact peoples lives, and research has shown that social media data
may be promising in understanding how people respond to health risks and social
crisis, which are the feelings they tend to share and how they are adapting to
unforeseen circumstances that threaten almost all societal spheres. This paper
presents results from a social media analysis of 61532 news headlines posted by
the major daily news outlet in Portugal, Sic Noticias, on Facebook, from
January to December 2020, focusing on the issues attention cycle and audiences
emotional response to the COVID news outburst. This work adds to the emergent
body of studies examining public response to the coronavirus pandemic on social
media data.

Epidemic control strategies have also caused damage to the economy by cutting
off humans' daily commute. In this paper, we develop an Individual-based
Reinforcement Learning Epidemic Control Agent (IDRLECA) to search for smart
epidemic control strategies that can simultaneously minimize infections and the
cost of mobility intervention. IDRLECA first hires an infection probability
model to calculate the current infection probability of each individual. Then,
the infection probabilities together with individuals' health status and
movement information are fed to a novel GNN to estimate the spread of the virus
through human contacts. The estimated risks are used to further support an RL
agent to select individual-level epidemic-control actions. The training of
IDRLECA is guided by a specially designed reward function considering both the
cost of mobility intervention and the effectiveness of epidemic control.
Moreover, we design a constraint for control-action selection that eases its
difficulty and further improve exploring efficiency. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that IDRLECA can suppress infections at a very low level
and retain more than 95% of human mobility.

to diagnose COVID-19 using end-to-end deep learning from a crowd-sourced
dataset of audio samples, achieving ROC-AUC of 0.846; (II) Our model, the
COVID-19 Identification ResNet, (CIdeR), has potential for rapid scalability,
minimal cost and improving performance as more data becomes available. This
could enable regular COVID-19 testing at apopulation scale; (III) We introduce
a novel modelling strategy using a custom deep neural network to diagnose
COVID-19 from a joint breath and cough representation; (IV) We release our four
stratified folds for cross parameter optimisation and validation on a standard

  Constraint","Deep neural networks have increasingly been used as an auxiliary tool in
healthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several
diagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical
settings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability,
and interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have
been developed that impose additional constraints during network training to
gain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their
acceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of
using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases
from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple
orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard
cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies
have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep
learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that
the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic
localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance,
and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in
accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification,
respectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation
applied. In addition to these findings, our work also presents a new
application of the OS regularizer in healthcare, increasing the post-hoc
interpretability and performance of deep learning models for COVID-19
classification to facilitate adoption of these methods in clinical settings. We
also identify the limitations of our strategy that can be explored for further
research in future.

lead to convergence-related degenerative behaviors, whereas
spatially-distributed, coevolutionary algorithms (CEAs) for GAN training, e.g.
Lipizzaner, are empirically robust to them. The robustness arises from
diversity that occurs by training populations of generators and discriminators
in each cell of a toroidal grid. Communication, where signals in the form of
parameters of the best GAN in a cell propagate in four directions: North,
South, West, and East, also plays a role, by communicating adaptations that are
both new and fit. We propose Lipi-Ring, a distributed CEA like Lipizzaner,
except that it uses a different spatial topology, i.e. a ring. Our central
question is whether the different directionality of signal propagation
(effectively migration to one or more neighbors on each side of a cell) meets
or exceeds the performance quality and training efficiency of Lipizzaner
Experimental analysis on different datasets (i.e, MNIST, CelebA, and COVID-19
chest X-ray images) shows that there are no significant differences between the
performances of the trained generative models by both methods. However,
Lipi-Ring significantly reduces the computational time (14.2%. . . 41.2%).
Thus, Lipi-Ring offers an alternative to Lipizzaner when the computational cost
of training matters.

the risk factor of mental health during covid 19 or lockdown. Although few
studies have been conducted on the role about the effect of social media use on
mental health during lockdown and impact on human reactive nature during
lockdown. As a rapidly spreading pandemic, a biomedical disease has serious
physical and tremendous mental health implications. An occupational community
of internal migrant workers is one of the most vulnerable, but neglected, and
is likely to develop psychological ill-effects due to COVID-19's double whammy
impact. Mental health is a crucial aspect that needs to be addressed during
this lock-down as all modes of communication revolve around the virus. There
are many difficulties with the unprecedented changes that have occurred so
quickly due to the pandemic and stay-at - home confinement to achieve social
distance and mitigate the risk of infection. These include impaired health,
well-being, and sleep as a result of daily routine disruption, anxiety, worry,
isolation, greater stress on family and work, and excessive screen time. An
essential part of our overall health and well-being is mental and emotional
health. An important skill is managing emotions and maintaining emotional
balance. It helps you face challenges and stress when you manage your emotional
health. Lack of skills in emotional regulation may lead to poor mental health
and relationship difficulties. It is as important to look after our mental
health as it is to look after our physical health. For mental health
professionals, the pandemic has also brought many ethical challenges.
