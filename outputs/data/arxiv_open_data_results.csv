  Clinical Diagnosis, Policy Effectiveness and Contact Tracing: A Survey","The widely spread CoronaVirus Disease (COVID)-19 is one of the worst
infectious disease outbreaks in history and has become an emergency of primary
international concern. As the pandemic evolves, academic communities have been
actively involved in various capacities, including accurate epidemic
estimation, fast clinical diagnosis, policy effectiveness evaluation and
development of contract tracing technologies. There are more than 23,000
academic papers on the COVID-19 outbreak, and this number is doubling every 20
days while the pandemic is still on-going [1]. The literature, however, at its
early stage, lacks a comprehensive survey from a data analytics perspective. In
this paper, we review the latest models for analyzing COVID19 related data,
conduct post-publication model evaluations and cross-model comparisons, and
collect data sources from different projects.

subexponential. Here we show that a piecewise quadratic law provides an
excellent fit during the thirty days after the first three fatalities on
January 20 and later since the end of March 2020. There is also a brief
intermediate period of exponential growth. During the second quadratic growth
phase, the characteristic time of the growth is about eight times shorter than
in the beginning, which can be understood as the occurrence of separate
hotspots. Quadratic behavior can be motivated by peripheral growth when further
spreading occurs only on the outskirts of an infected region. We also study
numerical solutions of a simple epidemic model, where the spatial extend of the
system is taken into account. To model the delayed onset outside China together
with the early one in China within a single model with minimal assumptions, we
adopt an initial condition of several hotspots, of which one reaches saturation
much earlier than the others. At each site, quadratic growth commences when the
local number of infections has reached a certain saturation level. The total
number of deaths does then indeed follow a piecewise quadratic behavior.

First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the

government implemented various measures to mitigate economic loss. From
issuance of stimulus check to social distancing measures, consumers had to
constantly alter their behavior in response to government policies. Using
anonymized card transactions and mobile device-based location tracking data, we
analyze the factors that contribute to these behavior changes, focusing on
stimulus check issuance and state-wide reopening. Our finding suggests that
stimulus payment has a significant immediate effect of boosting spending, but
it typically does not reverse a downward trend. State-wide reopening had a
small effect on spending. Foot traffic increased gradually after stimulus check
issuance, which coincided or preceded several policy changes and confounding
events (e.g., protests) in the US. Our results may be used to inform future
economic recovery policies and their potential consumer response.

  case examples","We examine the spatial modeling of the outbreak of COVID-19 in two regions:
the autonomous community of Andalusia in Spain and the mainland of Greece. We
start with a 0D compartmental epidemiological model consisting of Susceptible,
Exposed, Asymptomatic, (symptomatically) Infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, and
deceased populations. We emphasize the importance of the viral latent period
and the key role of an asymptomatic population. We optimize model parameters
for both regions by comparing predictions to the cumulative number of infected
and total number of deaths via minimizing the $\ell^2$ norm of the difference
between predictions and observed data. We consider the sensitivity of model
predictions on reasonable variations of model parameters and initial
conditions, addressing issues of parameter identifiability. We model both
pre-quarantine and post-quarantine evolution of the epidemic by a
time-dependent change of the viral transmission rates that arises in response
to containment measures. Subsequently, a spatially distributed version of the
0D model in the form of reaction-diffusion equations is developed. We consider
that, after an initial localized seeding of the infection, its spread is
governed by the diffusion (and 0D model ""reactions"") of the asymptomatic and
symptomatically infected populations, which decrease with the imposed
restrictive measures. We inserted the maps of the two regions, and we imported
population-density data into COMSOL, which was subsequently used to solve
numerically the model PDEs. Upon discussing how to adapt the 0D model to this
spatial setting, we show that these models bear significant potential towards
capturing both the well-mixed, 0D description and the spatial expansion of the
pandemic in the two regions. Veins of potential refinement of the model
assumptions towards future work are also explored.

  the COVID-19 Pandemic","The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has dramatically increased
the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the
same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted
their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot
be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights
-- as well as the possibility of controlling the system -- may be compromised.
Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many
variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different
models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and
assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem
using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and
observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic,
we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We
analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models,
considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which
leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models
according to their structural identifiability and observability under the
different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also
illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of
observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most
informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge
and measurements.

  between Income Groups","In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments
have encouraged and ordered citizens to practice social distancing,
particularly by working and studying at home. Intuitively, only a subset of
people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little
research on the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups
in US cities during the pandemic. The authors worked to fill this gap by
quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater
Houston, Texas. In this paper, we determined human mobility using
pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal
study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total
travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip
distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent
disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular,
there was a strong negative correlation ($\rho$ = -0.90) between a traveler's
estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility
adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets
experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of
distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The
findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the
mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The
study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and
researchers alike in the wake of an epidemic.

geographical scenarios. The model couples a system of kinetic transport
equations describing a population of commuters moving on a large scale

commuting population acting over a small scale (urban). The modeling approach
permits to avoid unrealistic effects of traditional diffusion models in
epidemiology, like infinite propagation speed on large scales and mass
migration dynamics. A construction based on the transport formalism of kinetic
theory allows to give a clear model interpretation to the interactions between
infected and susceptible in compartmental space-dependent models. In addition,
in a suitable scaling limit, our approach permits to couple the two populations
through a consistent diffusion model acting at the urban scale. A
discretization of the system based on finite volumes on unstructured grids,
combined with an asymptotic preserving method in time, shows that the model is
able to describe correctly the main features of the spatial expansion of an
epidemic. An application to the initial spread of COVID-19 is finally
presented.

work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using
deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A unique database was created,
so-called QU-COVID-family, consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS
CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to
identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify
the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN
classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to
visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the
decision of deep CNNs. Several Deep Learning classifiers were trained and
tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported. Original and preprocessed
images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks.
Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented
CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3
outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities
of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images,

  COVID-19 on Vulnerable Individuals and the Approaches Required to Help them
  Emerge from Lockdown","COVID-19 has shown a relatively low mortality rate in young healthy
individuals, with the majority of this group being asymptomatic or having mild
symptoms, while the severity of the disease among individuals with underlying
health conditions has caused signiffcant mortality rates worldwide.
Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of
society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and
vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown.
However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered
in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups.
To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely
SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding
their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the
spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to
different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A
Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by
slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this
modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of
vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate
among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to
vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very
dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with
information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be
protected and kept safer. Widespread utilisation would extend the protection
further beyond these high risk groups.

except the combination of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine appear to have

implementations. The effective policy requires taking into account public
information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to
understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for
adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome
include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different
contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach
that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c)
transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in
suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these
challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work
on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms
of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with.
Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts,
manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally,
interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an
interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical
framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over
multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous
counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized
aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional
constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing
hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments. In comparison
with knowledge-intensive baselines, we show quick sample efficient adaptation
to new knowledge and interpretability in the learned policy, especially in a

Human mobility has changed in various ways over the course of the pandemic.
Despite current studies on common mobility metrics, research specifically on
state-to-state mobility is very limited. By leveraging the mobile phone
location data from over 100 million anonymous devices, we estimate the
population flow between all states in the United States. We first analyze the
temporal pattern and spatial differences of between-state flow from January 1,
2020 to May 15, 2020. Then, with repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc analysis,
we discern different time-course patterns of between-state population flow by
pandemic severity groups. A further analysis shows moderate to high correlation
between the flow reduction and the pandemic severity, the strength of which
varies with different policies. This paper is promising in predicting imported

  the United States: County-Level Panel Data Analysis","This paper empirically examines how the opening of K-12 schools and colleges
is associated with the spread of COVID-19 using county-level panel data in the
United States. Using data on foot traffic and K-12 school opening plans, we
analyze how an increase in visits to schools and opening schools with different
teaching methods (in-person, hybrid, and remote) is related to the 2-weeks
forward growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our debiased panel data
regression analysis with a set of county dummies, interactions of state and
week dummies, and other controls shows that an increase in visits to both K-12
schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case growth
rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person
learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the
growth rate of cases. We also find that the positive association of K-12 school
visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties
that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These results have a causal
interpretation in a structural model with unobserved county and time
confounders. Sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to
timing assumptions and alternative specifications.

  diagnosis in chest CT images","The outbreak of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has changed
the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been
more than 100 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, including more than 2.4
million deaths. It is extremely important the early detection of the disease,
and the use of medical imaging such as chest X-ray (CXR) and chest Computed
Tomography (CCT) have proved to be an excellent solution. However, this process
requires clinicians to do it within a manual and time-consuming task, which is
not ideal when trying to speed up the diagnosis. In this work, we propose an
ensemble classifier based on probabilistic Support Vector Machine (SVM) in
order to identify pneumonia patterns while providing information about the
reliability of the classification. Specifically, each CCT scan is divided into
cubic patches and features contained in each one of them are extracted by
applying kernel PCA. The use of base classifiers within an ensemble allows our
system to identify the pneumonia patterns regardless of their size or location.
Decisions of each individual patch are then combined into a global one
according to the reliability of each individual classification: the lower the
uncertainty, the higher the contribution. Performance is evaluated in a real
scenario, yielding an accuracy of 97.86%. The large performance obtained and
the simplicity of the system (use of deep learning in CCT images would result
in a huge computational cost) evidence the applicability of our proposal in a
real-world environment.

United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during

to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect with
greater accuracy. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders

Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results

Three methods are known as LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The
bi-directional mode is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of
new cases and new deaths for Australia and Iran countries. This study is novel
as it attempts to implement the mentioned three deep learning methods, along
with their Bi-directional models, to predict COVID-19 new cases and new death
rate time series. All methods are compared, and results are presented. The
results are examined in the form of graphs and statistical analyses. The
results show that the Bi-directional models have lower error than other models.
Several error evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and
finally, the superiority of Bi-directional methods are determined. The
experimental results and statistical test show on datasets to compare the
proposed method with other baseline methods. This research could be useful for
organisations working against COVID-19 and determining their long-term plans.

  cycles behind new daily COVID-19 cases and what happens after lockdown","Spectral analysis characterises oscillatory time series behaviours such as
cycles, but accurate estimation requires reasonable numbers of observations.
Current COVID-19 time series for many countries are short: pre- and
post-lockdown series are shorter still. Accurate estimation of potentially
interesting cycles within such series seems beyond reach. We solve the problem
of obtaining accurate estimates from short time series by using recent Bayesian
spectral fusion methods. Here we show that transformed new daily COVID-19 cases
for many countries generally contain three cycles operating at wavelengths of
around 2.7, 4.1 and 6.7 days (weekly). We show that the shorter cycles are
suppressed after lockdown. The pre- and post lockdown differences suggest that
the weekly effect is at least partly due to non-epidemic factors, whereas the
two shorter cycles seem intrinsic to the epidemic. Unconstrained, new cases
grow exponentially, but the internal cyclic structure causes periodic falls in
cases. This suggests that lockdown success might only be indicated by four or
more daily falls in cases. Spectral learning for epidemic time series
contributes to the understanding of the epidemic process, helping evaluate
interventions and assists with forecasting. Spectral fusion is a general
technique that is able to fuse spectra recorded at different sampling rates,
which can be applied to a wide range of time series from many disciplines.

  lower than the classical herd immunity level","Most countries are suffering severely from the ongoing covid-19 pandemic
despite various levels of preventive measures. A common question is if and when
a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity
level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction
number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending
on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity
level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set
of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than
$h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured
community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also
categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and
high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates
proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\%$
rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is
required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when
immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups
with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates.
Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is
uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

prediction of COVID-19 deaths in various scenarios. For example, if treatment
priorities had been given to younger patients, the death toll in Wuhan and

strategy depends on the epidemic scale and is more effective in countries with

  epidemic forecasting","The basic reproductive number -- $R_0$ -- is one of the most common and most
commonly misapplied numbers in public health. Although often used to compare
outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity
that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$.
Here, we show how to predict outbreak size using estimates of the distribution
of secondary infections, leveraging both its average $R_0$ and the underlying
heterogeneity. To do so, we reformulate and extend a classic result from random
network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine
the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the
heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show
the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the
data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without
data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious
diseases like COVID-19, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically.
Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing

Functional Areas (MFAs), i.e., the geographic zones highly interconnected
according to the analysis of mobile positioning data. The MFAs do not coincide
necessarily with administrative borders as they are built observing natural
human mobility and, therefore, they can be used to inform, in a bottom-up
approach, local transportation, health and economic policies. After presenting
the methodology behind the MFAs, this study focuses on the link between the
COVID-19 pandemic and the MFAs in Austria. It emerges that the MFAs registered
an average number of infections statistically larger than the areas in the rest
of the country, suggesting the usefulness of the MFAs in the context of
targeted re-escalation policy responses to this health crisis.

has emerged as the preferred voting method during the COVID-19 pandemic. In
this paper, we examine the security of electronic systems used in the process
of voting by mail, including online voter registration and online ballot
tracking systems. The goals of these systems, to facilitate voter registration
and increase public confidence in elections, are laudable. They indisputably
provide a critical public good. It is for these reasons that understanding the
security and privacy posture of the mail-in voting process is paramount. We
find that online voter registration systems in some states have vulnerabilities
that allow adversaries to alter or effectively prevent a voter's registration.
We additionally find that ballot tracking systems raise serious privacy
questions surrounding ease of access to voter data. While the vulnerabilities
discussed here are unlikely to enable an adversary to modify votes, several
could have the effect of disenfranchising voters and reducing voter confidence
in U.S. elections infrastructure, thereby undermining the very purpose of these
systems.

by increasing the sharing volume dramatically - while in others having a
substantial lag. We confirm that these insights correlate strongly with
mobility, as measured using phone data. Finally, we illustrate that both media
sharing and mobility behaviors change more drastically around mandated
lockdowns, and less so around more lax recommendations. We make the media

researchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study
of open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129
open source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our

the collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug
categories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and

of software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to
perform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software
that are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model
construction through better synergies between data science practitioners and

and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza
pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as
well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in
a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local
governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate
suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between
economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public
interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major
problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts
certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such
economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,
there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,
which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul
Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or
otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future
generations.

radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage
patients into different risk levels. Deep learning based methods have taken an
active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images,
as witnessed in many recent works in early 2020. Most of these works first
train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an existing large-scale chest
x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much
smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains
may lead to poor performance for CNN due to two issues, the large domain shift
present in the biomedical imaging datasets and the extremely small scale of the
COVID-19 chest x-ray dataset. In an attempt to address these two important
issues, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification
in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting and propose a novel
domain adaptation method, Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network
(SODA). SODA is able to align the data distributions across different domains
in a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target
data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance
compared with recent state-of-the-art models in separating COVID-19 with common
pneumonia. We also present initial results showing that SODA can produce better

emergency), human mobility behavior decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70%
reduction of social contacts in Tokyo, showing the effectiveness of
non-compulsory measures. Furthermore, the reduction in data-driven human
mobility metrics showed correlation with the decrease in estimated effective
reproduction number of COVID-19 in Tokyo. Such empirical insights could inform
policy makers on deciding sufficient levels of mobility reduction to contain
the disease.

institutions with the closure of classroom teaching activities. In this
unprecedented crisis, of global proportion, educators and families had to deal
with unpredictability and learn new ways of teaching. This short essay aims to
explore the challenges posed to Portuguese higher education institutions and to
analyze the challenges posed to evaluation models. To this end, the relevance
of formative and summative assessment models in distance education is explored
and the perception of teachers and students about the practices adopted in
remote assessment is discussed. On the teachers' side, there is a high concern
about adopting fraud-free models, and an excessive focus on the summative
assessment component that in the distance learning model has less preponderance
when compared to the gradual monitoring and assessment processes of the
students, while on the students' side, problems arise regarding equipment to
follow the teaching sessions and concerns about their privacy, particularly
when intrusive IT solutions request the access to their cameras, audio, and
desktop.

  of Covid-19. The case of Argentina","We have studied the dynamic evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic in Argentina.
The marked heterogeneity in population density and the very extensive geography
of the country becomes a challenge itself. Standard compartment models fail
when they are implemented in the Argentina case. We extended a previous
successful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1 influenza
epidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobility
mechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into account
the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental
parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and
isolation of infected individuals ($\alpha$) and the ratio of people isolated
over the total infected ones ($p$). The evolution is more sensitive to the
$p-$parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts
the second wave before the former vanishes. This effect is intrinsic of
extensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.
The model presented here becomes a good predictor of the effects of public
policies as, for instance, the unavoidable vaccination campaigns starting at
present in the world.

in short), using a large-scale registered Internet domain name database, which
accounts for 260M of distinct domain names registered for 1.6K of distinct
top-level domains. We extracted 167K of Cov19doms that have been registered
between the end of December 2019 and the end of September 2020. We attempt to
answer the following research questions through our measurement study: RQ1: Is
the number of Cov19doms registrations correlated with the COVID-19 outbreaks?,
RQ2: For what purpose do people register Cov19doms? Our chief findings are as
follows: (1) Similar to the global COVID-19 pandemic observed around April
2020, the number of Cov19doms registrations also experienced the drastic
growth, which, interestingly, pre-ceded the COVID-19 pandemic by about a month,
(2) 70 % of active Cov19doms websites with visible content provided useful
information such as health, tools, or product sales related to COVID-19, and
(3) non-negligible number of registered Cov19doms was used for malicious
purposes. These findings imply that it has become more challenging to
distinguish domain names registered for legitimate purposes from others and
that it is crucial to pay close attention to how Cov19doms will be used/misused
in the future.

many countries around the globe, putting a significant burden on the health
sectors, affecting the macro economic conditions, and altering social
interactions amongst the population. In response, the academic community has
produced multiple forecasting models, approaches and algorithms to best predict
the different indicators of COVID-19, such as the number of confirmed infected
cases. Yet, researchers had little to no historical information about the
pandemic at their disposal in order to inform their forecasting methods. Our
work studies the predictive performance of models at various stages of the
pandemic to better understand their fundamental uncertainty and the impact of
data availability on such forecasts. We use historical data of COVID-19
infections from 253 regions from the period of 22nd January 2020 until 22nd
June 2020 to predict, through a rolling window backtesting framework, the
cumulative number of infected cases for the next 7 and 28 days. We implement
three simple models to track the root mean squared logarithmic error in this
6-month span, a baseline model that always predicts the last known value of the
cumulative confirmed cases, a power growth model and an epidemiological model
called SEIRD. Prediction errors are substantially higher in early stages of the
pandemic, resulting from limited data. Throughout the course of the pandemic,
errors regress slowly, but steadily. The more confirmed cases a country
exhibits at any point in time, the lower the error in forecasting future
confirmed cases. We emphasize the significance of having a rigorous backtesting
framework to accurately assess the predictive power of such models at any point
in time during the outbreak which in turn can be used to assign the right level
of certainty to these forecasts and facilitate better planning.

infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction
number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the
transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic,
is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading
events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity
under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission
dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor
settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care
facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family
gatherings, parties and night clubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to
understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity that outbreak
can be effectively contained with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs.
Here, we describe the potential types of SSEs, how they influence transmission,
and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.

primarily generated by the local transportation systems. The lockdown of the
cities and the imposition of travel restrictions led to a ~4-12 dB energy
decrease in seismic noise in mainland China. Data also show that different
Chinese cities experienced distinct periods of diminished cultural noise,
related to differences in local response to the epidemic. In contrast, there
was only ~1-6 dB energy decrease of seismic noise in Italy, after the country
was put under a lockdown. The noise data indicate that traffic flow did not
decrease as much in Italy, but show how different cities reacted distinctly to

  public transport system","The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus and its rapid spread underlines
the importance of understanding human mobility. Enclosed spaces, such as public
transport vehicles (e.g. buses and trains), offer a suitable environment for
infections to spread widely and quickly. Investigating the movement patterns
and the physical encounters of individuals on public transit systems is thus
critical to understand the drivers of infectious disease outbreaks. For
instance previous work has explored the impact of recurring patterns inherent
in human mobility on disease spread, but has not considered other dimensions
such as the distance travelled or the number of encounters. Here, we consider
multiple mobility dimensions simultaneously to uncover critical information for
the design of effective intervention strategies. We use one month of citywide
smart card travel data collected in Sydney, Australia to classify bus
passengers along three dimensions, namely the degree of exploration, the
distance travelled and the number of encounters. Additionally, we simulate
disease spread on the transport network and trace the infection paths. We
investigate in detail the transmissions between the classified groups while
varying the infection probability and the suspension time of pathogens. Our
results show that characterizing individuals along multiple dimensions
simultaneously uncovers a complex infection interplay between the different
groups of passengers, that would remain hidden when considering only a single
dimension. We also identify groups that are more influential than others given
specific disease characteristics, which can guide containment and vaccination
efforts.

in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic
around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also
be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in
Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness
may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and
progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden
standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives.
Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources
may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such
circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis
and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly
supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19
infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of
manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection
detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the
promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a
wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.

  Application","For the protection of people and society against harm and health threats --
especially for the COVID-19 pandemic -- a variety of different disciplines
needs to be involved. The data collection of very basic and health-related data
of individuals in today's highly mobile society does help to plan, protect, and
identify next steps health authorities and governments can, shall, or need to
plan for or even implement. Thus, every individual, every human, and every
inhabitant of the world is the key player -- very different to many past
crises'. And since the individual is involved -- all individuals -- his/her (a)
health and (b) privacy shall be considered in a very carefully crafted balance,
not overruling one aspect with another one or even prioritizing certain
aspects. Privacy remains the key. Thus, the solution of the current pandemic's
data collection can be based on a fully privacy-preserving application, which
can be used by individuals on their mobile devices, such as smartphones, while
maintaining at the same time their privacy. Additionally, respective data
collected in such a fully distributed setting does help to confine the pandemic
and can be achieved in a democratic and very open, but still and especially
privacy-protecting world. Therefore, the WeTrace approach and application as
described in this paper utilizes the Bluetooth Low Energy (BTE) communication
channel, many modern mobile devices offer, where asymmetric cryptography is
being applied to allows for the decyphering of a message for that destination
it had been intended for. Since literally every other potential participant
only listens to random data, even a brute force attack will not succeed.
WeTrace and its Open Source implementation is the only known approach so far,

can be applied to address many of the information needs made urgent by the
COVID-19 pandemic. This review surveys approximately 150 NLP studies and more

on four core NLP tasks: information retrieval, named entity recognition,
literature-based discovery, and question answering. We also describe work that
directly addresses aspects of the pandemic through four additional tasks: topic
modeling, sentiment and emotion analysis, caseload forecasting, and
misinformation detection. We conclude by discussing observable trends and
remaining challenges.

oxygenation membrane machines for impaired lungs: Extracorporeal Membrane
Oxygenation (ECMO) machines. Meanwhile, Hemodialysis (HD) machines, which use
membranes to supplement failing kidneys, are extremely common and widespread,
with orders of magnitude more available than for ECMO machines. This short
study examines whether the membranes for HD can be modified for use in blood
oxygenation (ECMO). To do so, it considers mass transfer at the micro-scale
level, and calculations for the macro-scale level such as blood pumping rates
and O2 supply pressure. Overall, while this conversion may technically be
possible, poor gas transport likely requires multiple HD membranes for one
patient.

  Feasibility and Optimal Pool Size Selection with Dilution Effects","Repeated asymptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 promises to control spread of
the virus but would require too many resources to implement at scale. Group
testing is promising for screening more people with fewer test resources:
multiple samples tested together in one pool can be excluded with one negative
test result. Existing approaches to group testing design for SARS-CoV-2
asymptomatic screening, however, do not consider dilution effects: that false
negatives become more common with larger pools. As a consequence, they may
recommend pool sizes that are too large or misestimate the benefits of
screening. Modeling dilution effects, we derive closed-form expressions for the
expected number of tests and false negative/positives per person screened under
two popular group testing methods: the linear and square array methods. We find
that test error correlation induced by a common viral load across an
individual's samples results in many fewer false negatives than would be
expected from less realistic but more widely assumed independent errors. This
insight also suggests that false positives can be controlled through repeated
tests without significantly increasing false negatives. Using these closed-form
expressions to trace a Pareto frontier over error rates and tests, we design
testing protocols for repeated asymptomatic screening of a large population. We
minimize disease prevalence by optimizing a time-varying pool sizes and
screening frequency constrained by daily test capacity and a false positive
limit. This provides a testing protocol practitioners can use for mitigating
COVID-19. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology
in controlling spread.

to properly evaluate the effectiveness of any treatment or preventive measure.
This study aimed to identify the most appropriate mathematical model to
prospectively predict the expected number of cases without any intervention.
The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in 28 countries was
analyzed and fitted to several simple rate models including the logistic,
Gompertz, quadratic, simple square, and simple exponential growth models. The
resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate predictions for more recent
data. While the Gompertz growth models (mean R2 = 0.998) best fitted the
current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit made future predictions
with logistic models prone to errors. Of the other models, the quadratic rate
model (mean R2 = 0.992) fitted the current data best for 25 (89 %) countries as
determined by R2 values. The simple square and quadratic models accurately
predicted the number of future total cases 37 and 36 days in advance
respectively, compared to only 15 days for the simple exponential model. The
simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future
cases while the quadratic and simple square models did not. These results
demonstrated that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given
country can be made significantly in advance without the need for complicated
models of population behavior and generate a reliable assessment of the
efficacy of current prescriptive measures against disease spread.

MPs about perceived UK tardiness to go into lockdown. The pandemic has led to
increased attention on ministers with a role in the crisis. However, generally
this surge has been civil. Prime minister Boris Johnson's severe illness with
COVID-19 resulted in an unusual peak of supportive responses on Twitter. Those
who receive more COVID-19 mentions in their replies tend to receive less abuse
(significant negative correlation). Following Mr Johnson's recovery, with
rising economic concerns and anger about lockdown violations by influential
figures, abuse levels began to rise in May. 1,902 replies to MPs within the
study period were found containing hashtags or terms that refute the existence
of the virus (e.g. #coronahoax, #coronabollocks, 0.04% of a total 4.7 million
replies, or 9% of the number of mentions of ""stay home save lives"" and
variants). These have tended to be more abusive. Evidence of some members of
the public believing in COVID-19 conspiracy theories was also found. Higher
abuse levels were associated with hashtags blaming China for the pandemic.

valuable data about affected people, donations and help requests. Recent
studies highlight the need to filter information on social media into
fine-grained content labels. However, identifying useful information from
massive amounts of social media posts during a crisis is a challenging task. In
this paper, we propose I-AID, a multimodel approach to automatically categorize
tweets into multi-label information types and filter critical information from
the enormous volume of social media data. I-AID incorporates three main
components: i) a BERT-based encoder to capture the semantics of a tweet and
represent as a low-dimensional vector, ii) a graph attention network (GAT) to
apprehend correlations between tweets' words/entities and the corresponding
information types, and iii) a Relation Network as a learnable distance metric
to compute the similarity between tweets and their corresponding information
types in a supervised way. We conducted several experiments on two real
publicly-available datasets. Our results indicate that I-AID outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of weighted average F1 score by +6% and
+4% on the TREC-IS dataset and COVID-19 Tweets, respectively.

  Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
discovered coronavirus. It is similar to influenza viruses and raises concerns
through alarming levels of spread and severity resulting in an ongoing pandemic
worldwide. Within eight months (by August 2020), it infected 24.0 million
persons worldwide and over 824 thousand have died. Drones or Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) are very helpful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic. This work
investigates the drone-based systems, COVID-19 pandemic situations, and
proposes an architecture for handling pandemic situations in different
scenarios using real-time and simulation-based scenarios. The proposed
architecture uses wearable sensors to record the observations in Body Area
Networks (BANs) in a push-pull data fetching mechanism. The proposed
architecture is found to be useful in remote and highly congested pandemic
areas where either the wireless or Internet connectivity is a major issue or
chances of COVID-19 spreading are high. It collects and stores the substantial
amount of data in a stipulated period and helps to take appropriate action as
and when required. In real-time drone-based healthcare system implementation
for COVID-19 operations, it is observed that a large area can be covered for
sanitization, thermal image collection, and patient identification within a
short period (2 KMs within 10 minutes approx.) through aerial route. In the
simulation, the same statistics are observed with an addition of
collision-resistant strategies working successfully for indoor and outdoor

  evidence based on the 1987 crash, 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic","Every unique crisis, a new and novel risk factor, leads to a rapid,
synchronous and panic sell-off by the investors that lead to a massive stock
market crash, termed as mainshock, which usually continues for more than one
day. Though most of the stocks start recovering from the crash within a short
period, the effect of the crash remains throughout the recovery phase. During
the recovery, as the market remains in stress, any small perturbation leads to
a relatively smaller aftershock, which may also occur for a few days.
Statistical analysis of the mainshock and the aftershocks for the crash of
1987, the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic shows that they
follow the Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) power law. The duration of the influence of
the mainshock, within which aftershocks are considered, has been calculated
using structural break analysis. The analysis shows that high magnitude
aftershocks comparable to the mainshock are rare but low magnitude aftershocks
can be seen frequently till the full recovery of the market. It is also
consistent with the psychology of the investors that when the unique crisis
becomes known, the market does not react too irrationally as it did initially,
and hence subsequent crashes become relatively smaller. The results indicate
that there is a possibility of the occurrence of future low magnitude
aftershocks due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis may help
investors make rational investment decisions during the stressed period after a
major market crash.

order dependencies violation, (2) the point or period anomalies, and (3) the
issue of reporting delay. To address these detected issues, we propose the
corresponding repairing methods and procedures if corrections are necessary. In
addition, we integrate the COVID-19 reported cases with the county-level

deep neural networks, to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In scientific
domains, the scientist often wishes to discover which features are actually
important for making the predictions. These discoveries may lead to costly
follow-up experiments and as such it is important that the error rate on
discoveries is not too high. Model-X knockoffs enable important features to be
discovered with control of the FDR. However, knockoffs require rich generative
models capable of accurately modeling the knockoff features while ensuring they
obey the so-called ""swap"" property. We develop Deep Direct Likelihood Knockoffs
(DDLK), which directly minimizes the KL divergence implied by the knockoff swap
property. DDLK consists of two stages: it first maximizes the explicit
likelihood of the features, then minimizes the KL divergence between the joint
distribution of features and knockoffs and any swap between them. To ensure
that the generated knockoffs are valid under any possible swap, DDLK uses the
Gumbel-Softmax trick to optimize the knockoff generator under the worst-case
swap. We find DDLK has higher power than baselines while controlling the false
discovery rate on a variety of synthetic and real benchmarks including a task
involving a large dataset from one of the epicenters of COVID-19.

  Sub-Sampling","Physical contacts result in the spread of various phenomena such as viruses,
gossips, ideas, packages and marketing pamphlets across a population. The
spread depends on how people move and co-locate with each other, or their
mobility patterns. How far such phenomena spread has significance for both
policy making and personal decision making, e.g., studying the spread of
COVID-19 under different intervention strategies such as wearing a mask. In
practice, mobility patterns of an entire population is never available, and we
usually have access to location data of a subset of individuals. In this paper,
we formalize and study the problem of estimating the spread of a phenomena in a
population, given that we only have access to sub-samples of location visits of
some individuals in the population. We show that simple solutions such as
estimating the spread in the sub-sample and scaling it to the population, or
more sophisticated solutions that rely on modeling location visits of
individuals do not perform well in practice, the former because it ignores
contacts between unobserved individuals and sampled ones and the latter because
it yields inaccurate modeling of co-locations. Instead, we directly model the
co-locations between the individuals. We introduce PollSpreader and
PollSusceptible, two novel approaches that model the co-locations between
individuals using a contact network, and infer the properties of the contact
network using the subsample to estimate the spread of the phenomena in the
entire population. We show that our estimates provide an upper bound and a
lower bound on the spread of the disease in expectation. Finally, using a large
high-resolution real-world mobility dataset, we experimentally show that our
estimates are accurate, while other methods that do not correctly account for
co-locations between individuals result in wrong observations (e.g, premature
herd-immunity).

starting from the end of February 2020, began spreading along the Italian
peninsula, by first attacking small communities in north regions, and then
extending to the center and south of Italy, including the two main islands.
  Objective. The creation of a forecast model that manages to alert the
decision-making bodies and, in particular, the healthcare system, to hinder the
emergence of any other pandemic outbreaks, or the arrival of subsequent
pandemic waves.
  Methods. A new mathematical model to describe the pandemic is given. The
model includes the class of undiagnosed infected people, and has a multi-region
extension, to cope with the in-time and in-space heterogeneity of the epidemic.
  Results. We obtain a robust and reliable tool for the forecast of the total
and active cases, which can be also used to simulate different scenarios.
  Conclusions. We are able to address a number of issues, such as assessing the
adoption of the lockdown in Italy, started from 11 March 2020, and how to
employ a rapid screening test campaign for containing the epidemic.

  Coronavirus Epidemic Using Hybridized Deep Learning and Fuzzy Rule Induction","In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019,
governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions
under high uncertainty at their best efforts. Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC)
simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are
broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many
possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability
distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested
cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities
around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the
population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds
and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is
reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of
a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and
the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case
study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule
induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development
is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a
MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction
of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited
from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell
about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.

  Infected Lung through Constraint-Based Modelling","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with
currently no effective antiviral drug except treatments for symptomatic
therapy. Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic
networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g.,
predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a
metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung
cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the
replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of
expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific
metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and
gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the
viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that
are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative
stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism,
and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative
disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug
combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug
repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug
candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being

  Surveillance as an Early Warning Signal of Future Hospitalizations","Importance: Alternative methods for hospital utilization forecasting,
essential information in hospital crisis planning, are necessary in a novel
pandemic when traditional data sources such as disease testing are limited.
Objective: Determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data
can be used as syndromic surveillance to forecast COVID-19 hospitalizations in
the communities where employees live. Design: Retrospective cohort study.
Setting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total
of 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841
employees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020,
who live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily
employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text
messaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean
absolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital
census at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD
= 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120),
living in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Our model has an MAE of 6.9 COVID-19
patients and a WMAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital
network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5
patients (WMAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). At Hospital 1, a doubling of the
number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponds to 4 additional
employees reporting symptoms at the mean for Hospital 1) is associated with a
5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at Hospital 1 in 7 days (95% CI:
(0.02, 0.07)). Conclusions: We found that a real-time employee health
attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to predict subsequent
hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in
New England.

  Pandemic","In this paper, we propose a new real-time differential virus transmission
model, which can give more accurate and robust short-term predictions of
COVID-19 transmitted infectious disease with benefits of near-term trend
projection. Different from the existing Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed
(SEIR) based virus transmission models, which fits well for pandemic modeling
with sufficient historical data, the new model, which is also SEIR based, uses
short history data to find the trend of the changing disease dynamics for the
infected, the dead and the recovered so that it can naturally accommodate the
adaptive real-time changes of disease mitigation, business activity and social
behavior of populations. As the parameters of the improved SEIR models are
trained by short history window data for accurate trend prediction, our
differential epidemic model, essentially are window-based time-varying SEIR
model. Since SEIR model still is a physics-based disease transmission model,
its near-term (like one month) projection can still be very instrumental for
policy makers to guide their decision for disease mitigation and business
activity policy change in a real-time. This is especially useful if the
pandemic lasts more than one year with different phases across the world like
1918 flu pandemic. Numerical results on the recent COVID-19 data from China,

analyzed publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets of zygotes, 4-cell,
8-cell, morula, inner cell mass, epiblast, primitive endoderm and trophectoderm
for the coronavirus receptors (ACE2, BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP), the Spike protein
cleavage enzymes (TMPRSS2, CTSL). We also analyzed the presence of host genes
involved in viral replication, the endosomal sorting complexes required for
transport (ESCRT) and SARS-Cov-2 interactions. The results reveal that ACE2,
BSG, DPP4 and ANPEP are expressed in the cells of the zygote, to blastocyst
including the trophectodermal lineage. ACE2, TMPRSS, BSG and CTSL are
co-transcribed in a proportion of epiblast cells and most cells of the
trophectoderm. The embryonic and trophectodermal cells also express genes for
proteins ESCRT, viral replication and those that interact with SARS-CoV-2. We
identified 1985 genes in epiblast and 1452 genes in the trophectoderm that are
enriched in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells; 216 genes of these are
common in both the cell types. These genes are associated with lipid
metabolism, lysosome, peroxisome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
Together our results suggest that developing human embryos could be permissive
to coronavirus entry by both canonical and non-canonical mechanisms and they
also express the genes for proteins involved in viral endocytosis and
replication. This knowledge will be useful for evidence-based patient
management for IVF during the COVID-19 pandemic.

  COVID-19 Diagnosis: A Review","The challenge of learning a new concept, object, or a new medical disease
recognition without receiving any examples beforehand is called Zero-Shot
Learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning based methodologies
such as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement
of large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the
model. ZSL is known for having minimal human intervention by relying only on
previously known or trained concepts plus currently existing auxiliary
information. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios, from
unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and
unforeseen diseases such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We
introduce a novel and broaden solution called Few/one-shot learning, and
present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot
learning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot
Learning, including state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our
recommended solution, motivations behind each approach, their advantages over
each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers to proceed with the
best techniques and practices based on their applications. We then review
through different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety
of splits, and the evaluation protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss
the recent applications and future directions of ZSL. We aim to convey a useful
intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning
tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications
in the current modern yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast
diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging the readers to develop other
similar AI-based automated detection/recognition systems using ZSL.

2102.13210v1,2021-02-22,2021-02-22T11:11:41Z,Is Covid-19 severity associated with ACE2 degradation?,"Covid-19 is particularly mild with children, and its severity escalates with
age. Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular,
it was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in
children protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an
inverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try
to reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not
monotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that
depends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with
most existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked
for ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the
protease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The
negative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not
paradoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation
that predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus
propagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to
protect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low
ACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the
inflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the
angiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation
triggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its
many post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome
of children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower
ACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the
alternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the
anti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.

while smart-tracing technology raises people's privacy concerns. In this paper,
we propose a solution for the life-or-economy dilemma that does not require

transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only
relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective
Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search
mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and
maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely
Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility.
The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to
generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a
well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation
between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two
exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it
get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD
dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low
level while retaining 76\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is

contacts, they typically require collection of privacy-intrusive information

impact. Mental health is a crucial aspect that needs to be addressed during
this lock-down as all modes of communication revolve around the virus. There
are many difficulties with the unprecedented changes that have occurred so
quickly due to the pandemic and stay-at - home confinement to achieve social
distance and mitigate the risk of infection. These include impaired health,
well-being, and sleep as a result of daily routine disruption, anxiety, worry,
isolation, greater stress on family and work, and excessive screen time. An
essential part of our overall health and well-being is mental and emotional
health. An important skill is managing emotions and maintaining emotional
balance. It helps you face challenges and stress when you manage your emotional
health. Lack of skills in emotional regulation may lead to poor mental health
and relationship difficulties. It is as important to look after our mental
health as it is to look after our physical health. For mental health
professionals, the pandemic has also brought many ethical challenges.

asymptomatic patients, called SUTRA. The acronym stands for Susceptible,
Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed Approach. There are several novel
features of our proposed model. First, whereas previous papers have divided the
patient population into Asymptomatic and Infected, we have explicitly accounted
for the fact that, due to contact tracing and other such protocols, some
fraction of asymptomatic patients could also be detected; in addition, there
would also be large numbers of undetected asymptomatic patients. Second, we
have explicitly taken into account the spatial spread of a pandemic over time,
through a parameter called ""reach."" Third, we present numerically stable
methods for estimating the parameters in our model.
  We have applied our model to predict the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic
in several countries. Where data on the number of recovered patients is
available, we predict the number of active cases as a function of time. Where
recovery data is not available, we predict the number of daily new cases. We
present our predictions for three countries with quite distinct types of
disease progression, namely: (i) India which has had a smooth rise followed by
an equally smooth fall-off in the number of active cases, (ii) Italy, which has
witnessed multiple peaks in the number of active cases, and has also witnessed
multiple ""phases"" of the pandemic, and (iii) the USA which has erratic recovery
data. In all cases, the predictions closely match the actually observed

epidemiological parameters to vary over time. We estimate the disease
transmission rate via a Gaussian process prior, which captures nonlinear
changes over time without the need of specific parametric assumptions. We
utilize a parallel-tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to efficiently
sample from the highly correlated posterior space. Predictions for future
observations are done by sampling from their posterior predictive
distributions. Performance of the proposed approach is assessed using simulated

  posteroanterior chest X-ray images","The infection of respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starts with
the upper respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the infection can progress
to lungs and develop pneumonia. The conventional way of COVID-19 diagnosis is
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less
sensitive during early stages; especially if the patient is asymptomatic, which
may further cause more severe pneumonia. In this context, several deep learning
models have been proposed to identify pulmonary infections using publicly
available chest X-ray (CXR) image datasets for early diagnosis, better
treatment and quick cure. In these datasets, presence of less number of
COVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and
Tuberculosis) raises the challenge for unbiased learning of deep learning
models. All deep learning models opted class balancing techniques to solve this
issue; which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process.
Moreover, the deep learning models are also data hungry and need massive
computation resources. Therefore for quicker diagnosis, this research proposes
a novel pinball loss function based one-class support vector machine
(PB-OCSVM), that can work in presence of limited COVID-19 positive CXR samples
with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency and to minimize the false
predictions. The performance of the proposed model is compared with
conventional OCSVM and existing deep learning models, and the experimental
results prove that the proposed model outperformed over state-of-the-art
methods. To validate the robustness of the proposed model, experiments are also
performed with noisy CXR images and UCI benchmark datasets.

  the spike glycoprotein with heparin","Heparin is administered intravenously as an anticoagulant to COVID-19
patients and via aerosol to treat other lung diseases. It has recently been
found to have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 as it hinders attachment of
the virus to the host cell by binding to the virus spike glycoprotein. Here, we
describe molecular dynamics simulations and experiments to investigate how
heparin binds to the spike and the mechanism by which it exerts its antiviral
activity. The simulations show that heparin polyanionic chains can bind at
long, mostly positively charged patches on the spike, and thereby mask the
basic residues of the receptor binding domain and the basic S1/S2 site, which
is unique specific to SAR-CoV-2 and is important for furin-mediated spike
cleavage and the subsequent formation of its post-fusion conformation.
Experiments corroborated the simulation results by showing that heparin binds
the basic S1/S2 site of spike, inhibiting cleavage by furin. The simulations
show that heparin can act on the hinge region responsible for the motion of the
RBD between inactive closed and active open conformations of the spike. In
simulations of the closed spike, heparin binds the RBD and the N-terminal
domain of two adjacent spike subunits and hinders the opening. In simulations
of the open spike, heparin binds similarly but induces stabilization of the
hinge region and a change in RBD motion. Our results indicate that heparin is
able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by allosterically hindering binding to the
host cell receptor, by directly competing with binding to the host heparan
sulfate proteoglycan co-receptors, and by preventing spike cleavage by furin.
Furthermore, the simulations provide insights into how heparan sulphate
proteoglycans on the host cell can facilitate viral infection. Our results will
aid the rational optimization of heparin derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral
therapy.

context. The COVID-19 pandemic led Brazil to recommend and, at times, impose
social distancing, with the partial closure of economic activities, schools,
and restrictions on events and public services. Preliminary evidence shows that
intense coexistence increases domestic violence, while social distancing
measures may have prevented access to public services and networks,
information, and help. We propose an agent-based model (ABM), called VIDA, to
illustrate and examine multi-causal factors that influence events that generate
violence. A central part of the model is the multi-causal stress indicator,
created as a probability trigger of domestic violence occurring within the
family environment. Two experimental design tests were performed: (a) absence
or presence of the deterrence system of domestic violence against women and (b)
measures to increase social distancing. VIDA presents comparative results for
metropolitan regions and neighbourhoods considered in the experiments. Results
suggest that social distancing measures, particularly those encouraging staying
at home, may have increased domestic violence against women by about 10%. VIDA
suggests further that more populated areas have comparatively fewer cases per
hundred thousand women than less populous capitals or rural areas of urban
concentrations. This paper contributes to the literature by formalising, to the
best of our knowledge, the first model of domestic violence through agent-based

  Fitted Face Masks","The rapid emergence and the disastrous impact of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on public health, societies, and
economies around the world has created an urgent need for understanding the
pathways critical for virus transmission. Airborne virus transmission by
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major
contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of
face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many
countries. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the
filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In
particular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is
neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face
masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we
consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic person
to a healthy person, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor
environment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular
Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number
of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations
of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and
inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic
filtering of IAs by the face masks. Furthermore, we show that the fit of the
face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability.
We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment
tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it encompasses the randomness of the
transmission process and enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical
averages.

  Automata","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which is caused by SARS-COV2 has become a
pandemic. This disease is highly infectious and potentially fatal, causing a
global public health concern. To contain the spread of COVID-19, governments
are adopting nationwide interventions, like lockdown, containment and
quarantine, restrictions on travel, cancelling social events and extensive
testing. To understand the effects of these measures on the control of the
epidemic in a data-driven manner, we propose a probabilistic cellular automata
(PCA) based modified SEIQR model. The transitions associated with the model is
driven by data available on chronology, symptoms, pathogenesis and
transmissivity of the virus. By arguing that the lattice-based model captures
the features of the dynamics along with the existing fluctuations, we perform
rigorous computational analyses of the model to take into account of the
spatial dynamics of social distancing measures imposed on the people.
Considering the probabilistic behavioural aspects associated with mitigation
strategies, we study the model considering factors like population density and
testing efficiency. Using the model, we focus on the variability of epidemic
dynamics data for different countries and point out the reasons behind these
contrasting observations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
attempt to model COVID-19 spread using PCA that gives us both spatial and
temporal variations of the infection spread with the insight about the
contributions of different infection parameters.

over 33 million people have been infected worldwide and approximately 1 million
people worldwide have died from the disease caused by this virus, COVID-19. In
the US alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and over 200,000
deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and
workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5\% of patients require
mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is
the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal
protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple
adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU
equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous
installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper
reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits
adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists of
a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with
camera vision control via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located
outside the room. Engineering system tests demonstrated that the open-loop
mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5\,mm, and that the average
positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was
5.94\,mm. Successful usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were
carried out and are reported. In addition to enabling a significant reduction
in PPE consumption, the prototype system has been shown in a preliminary
evaluation to significantly reduce the total time required for a respiratory
therapist to perform typical setting adjustments on a commercial ventilator,
including donning and doffing PPE, from 271 seconds to 109 seconds.

Computer-aided screening tools with greater sensitivity is imperative for
disease diagnosis and prognosis as early as possible. It also can be a helpful
tool in triage for testing and clinical supervision of COVID-19 patients.
However, designing such an automated tool from non-invasive radiographic images
is challenging as many manually annotated datasets are not publicly available
yet, which is the essential core requirement of supervised learning schemes.
This article proposes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based
classification approach considering both the inter- and intra-slice spatial
voxel information. The proposed system is trained in an end-to-end manner on
the 3D patches from the whole volumetric CT images to enlarge the number of
training samples, performing the ablation studies on patch size determination.
We integrate progressive resizing, segmentation, augmentations, and
class-rebalancing to our 3D network. The segmentation is a critical
prerequisite step for COVID-19 diagnosis enabling the classifier to learn
prominent lung features while excluding the outer lung regions of the CT scans.
We evaluate all the extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset,
named MosMed, having binary- and multi-class chest CT image partitions. Our
experimental results are very encouraging, yielding areas under the ROC curve
of 0.914 and 0.893 for the binary- and multi-class tasks, respectively,

individual testing approach has received a lot of interest lately for massive
testing of COVID-19. Many studies simply assume samples mixed in a group are
independent. However, this assumption may not be reasonable for a contagious
disease like COVID-19. Specifically, people within a family tend to infect each
other and thus are likely to be positively correlated. By exploiting positive
correlation, we make the following two main contributions. One is to provide a
rigorous proof that further cost reduction can be achieved by using the Dorfman
two-stage method when samples within a group are positively correlated. The
other is to propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm for pooled testing
with a social graph, where an edge in the social graph connects frequent social
contacts between two persons. Such an algorithm leads to notable cost reduction
(roughly 20%-35%) compared to random pooling when the Dorfman two-stage
algorithm is applied.

  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?","As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.

characteristics of UK horticultural production, notably labour reliance and

understand the effects of these disruptive events as we move from 2020 into

information from a relatively small (n = 19) but indicative group of producers.
The main novelty of the results is to suggest that a very substantial majority
of producers either plan to scale back production in 2021 (47%) or have been
unable to make plans for 2021 because of uncertainty (37%). The results also
add to broader evidence that the sector has experienced profound labour supply
challenges, with implications for labour cost and quality. The study discusses
the implications of these insights from producers in terms of productivity and
automation, as well as in terms of broader economic implications. Although
automation is generally recognised as the long-term future for the industry
(89%), it appeared in the study as the second most referred short-term option
(32%) only after changes to labour schemes and policies (58%). Currently,
automation plays a limited role in contributing to the UK's horticultural

channels, implicated in OTC, have ankyrin repeat domains (TRPs-ARDs), I
hypothesized that interaction of S-ARBMs and TRPs-ARDs could dysregulate the

expressed in the olfactory epithelium, taste buds, trigeminal neurons in the
oronasal cavity and vagal neurons in the trachea/lungs. Furthermore, this
hypothesis is supported by studies that have shown: (i) respiratory viruses
interact with TRPA1 and TRPV1 on sensory nerves and epithelial cells in the

to lungs injuries produced by the sensitization of TRPV1 and TRPV4, and (iii)

inhibit TRPA1, TRPV1, TRPV3 and TRPV4. Herein, results of blind dockings of
S-ARBMs, 408-RQIAPG-413 (in RBD but distal from the ACE-2 binding region) and

in Beijing and Shanghai will end soon within two weeks, while for most part of
China, including the majority of cities in Hubei province, the success of
anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan
is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th. We expect
it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover, by inverse inference, we
find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province and Wuhan all can be
dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two
days at the early stage.

  On Deep COVID-19 Models","Early identification of COVID-19 using a deep model trained on Chest X-Ray
and CT images has gained considerable attention from researchers to speed up
the process of identification of active COVID-19 cases. These deep models act
as an aid to hospitals that suffer from the unavailability of specialists or
radiologists, specifically in remote areas. Various deep models have been
proposed to detect the COVID-19 cases, but few works have been performed to
prevent the deep models against adversarial attacks capable of fooling the deep
model by using a small perturbation in image pixels. This paper presents an
evaluation of the performance of deep COVID-19 models against adversarial
attacks. Also, it proposes an efficient yet effective Fuzzy Unique Image
Transformation (FUIT) technique that downsamples the image pixels into an
interval. The images obtained after the FUIT transformation are further
utilized for training the secure deep model that preserves high accuracy of the
diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and provides reliable defense against the
adversarial attacks. The experiments and results show the proposed model
prevents the deep model against the six adversarial attacks and maintains high
accuracy to classify the COVID-19 cases from the Chest X-Ray image and CT image
Datasets. The results also recommend that a careful inspection is required
before practically applying the deep models to diagnose the COVID-19 cases.

Spectral analysis is used to reveal additional properties of the data, and the

of the seven-day moving average is also discussed, specifically, the cause of
its jaggedness and the phase error it introduces. In comparison, other
filtering techniques and Fourier processing produce superior smoothing and have
zero phase error. Both of these are presented, and they are extended to isolate
several frequency ranges. This extracts some of the same short-term variability
that is resynthesized, and it shows that fluctuations with periods between 8

  Problems","The non-population conserving SIR (SIR-NC) model to describe the spread of
infections in a community is proposed and studied. Unlike the standard SIR
model, SIR-NC does not assume population conservation. Although similar in form
to the standard SIR, SIR-NC admits a closed form solution while allowing us to
model mortality, and also provides different, and arguably a more realistic,
interpretation of the model parameters. Numerical comparisons of this SIR-NC
model with the standard, population conserving, SIR model are provided.
Extensions to include imported infections, interacting communities, and models
that include births and deaths are presented and analyzed. Several numerical
examples are also presented to illustrate these models. Two control problems
for the SIR-NC epidemic model are presented. First we consider the continuous
time model predictive control in which the cost function variables correspond
to the levels of lockdown, the level of testing and quarantine, and the number
of infections. We also include a switching cost for moving between lockdown
levels. A discrete time version that is more amenable to computation is then
presented along with numerical illustrations. We then consider a
multi-objective and multi-community control where we can define multiple cost
functions on the different communities and obtain the minimum cost control to
keep the value function corresponding to these control objectives below a
prescribed threshold.

  Restrictions for Epidemic Control","The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has swept across more than 180
countries and territories since late January 2020. As a worldwide emergency
response, governments have taken various measures and implemented policies,
such as self-quarantine, travel restrictions, work from home, and regional
lockdown, to control the rapid spread of this epidemic. The common intention of
these countermeasures is to restrict human mobility because COVID-19 is a
highly contagious disease that is spread by human-to-human transmission.
Medical experts and policy makers have expressed the urgency of being able to
effectively evaluate the effects of human restriction policies with the aid of
big data and information technology. Thus, in this study, based on big human
mobility data and city POI data, we designed an interactive visual analytics
system named EpiMob (Epidemic Mobility). The system interactively simulates the
changes in human mobility and the number of infected people in response to the
implementation of a certain restriction policy or combination of policies
(e.g., regional lockdown, telecommuting, screening). Users can conveniently
designate the spatial and temporal ranges for different mobility restriction
policies, and the result reflecting the infection situation under different
policies is dynamically displayed and can be flexibly compared. We completed
multiple case studies of the largest metropolitan area in Japan (i.e., Greater
Tokyo Area) and conducted interviews with domain experts to demonstrate that
our system can provide illustrative insight by measuring and comparing the
effects of different human mobility restriction policies for epidemic control.

great importance to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19 and predict the time

propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the
patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict
the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the
severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight
for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of
imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity
regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data
and learn the shared information across the classification task and the
regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the
disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to
deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives.
Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with
422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to
severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show

less unequal as the epidemic runs its course, and that both peak and cumulative

suggest that structural rearrangements dramatically enhance CoV2019 activity.
We identify a new first stage of infection that precedes structural
rearrangements by using biomolecular evolutionary theory to identify sequence
differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of four
single mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much
stronger viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous
dynamics of human coronavirus infection is a dramatic example of evolutionary
approach of self-organized networks to criticality. It may favor a very
successful vaccine. The identified mutations can be used to test the present
theory experimentally. The theory also works well for the newer strains and
explains their increased contagiousness.

  Main Protease","The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new
virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease
Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies
have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro
inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a
glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly
attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than
that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying
on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a
molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.
Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the
catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a
second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region
localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of
the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this
second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic
site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains
exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access
through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and
reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could
interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings
provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro
inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic
strategies for COVID-19.

on which we present, herein, some of the first evidence of how Americans
responded to the increasing concerns that government authorities, the private
sector, and public health experts might use individual-level location data to
track the COVID-19 spread. First, we found a significant decreasing trend of
mobile-app location-sharing opt-out. Whereas areas with more Democrats were
more privacy-concerned than areas with more Republicans before the advent of
the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the overall opt-out
rates after COVID-19, and this effect was more salient among Democratic than
Republican cities. Second, people who practiced social distancing (i.e., those
who traveled less and interacted with fewer close contacts during the pandemic)
were also less likely to opt-out, whereas the converse was true for people who
practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among
Democratic than Republican cities. Third, high-income populations and males,
compared with low-income populations and females, were more
privacy-conscientious and more likely to opt-out of location tracking.

prevent continued transmission. Here we consider a cryptographic approach to
contact tracing based on secure two-party computation (2PC). We begin by
considering the problem of comparing a set of location histories held by two
parties to determine whether they have come within some threshold distance
while at the same time maintaining the privacy of the location histories. We
propose a solution to this problem using pre-shared keys, adapted from an
equality testing protocol due to Ishai et al [2]. We discuss how this protocol
can be used to maintain privacy within practical contact tracing scenarios,

for fast and efficient testing of large numbers of patients for the presence of
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of
individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput
of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known

unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only
objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the
case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of
this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently
repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a
computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR
tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of
false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests,
especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001
the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing
the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of
individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more
than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests
in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the

average number of new infections that an infected person produces. This
so-called reproduction number has significant implications for the disease
progression. There has been increasing literature suggesting that
superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused

paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of
the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly,
we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to
estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of
COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of
the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves
the performance of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the
derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading
to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as
a valuable heuristic for understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases

multi-resource allocation problem with heterogeneous demands and Leontief
utilities. Unlike existing settings, we allow each agent to specify a
constraint to only accept allocations from a subset of the total supply for
each resource. Such constraints often arise from location constraints (e.g.
among all of the volunteer nurses, only those who live nearby can work at
hospital A due to commute constraints. So hospital A can only receive
allocations of volunteers from a subset of the total supply). This can also
model a type of substitute effect where some agents need 1 unit of resource A
\emph{or} B, but some other agents specifically want A, and some specifically
want B. We propose a new mechanism called Group Dominant Resource Fairness
which determines the allocations by solving a small number of linear programs.
The proposed method satisfies Pareto optimality, envy-freeness,
strategy-proofness, and a notion of sharing incentive for our setting. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first mechanism to achieve all four
properties in our setting. Furthermore, we show numerically that our method
scales better to large problems than alternative approaches. Finally, although
motivated by the problem of medical resource allocation in a pandemic, our
mechanism can be applied more broadly to resource allocation under Leontief
utilities with accessibility constraints.

  time of favourable events","As a reaction to the pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a multitude of clinical trials for the treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 or the resulting corona disease (COVID-19) are globally at various
stages from planning to completion. Although some attempts were made to
standardize study designs, this was hindered by the ferocity of the pandemic
and the need to set up trials quickly. We take the view that a successful
treatment of COVID-19 patients (i) increases the probability of a recovery or
improvement within a certain time interval, say 28 days; (ii) aims to expedite
favourable events within this time frame; and (iii) does not increase mortality
over this time period. On this background we discuss the choice of endpoint and
its analysis. Furthermore, we consider consequences of this choice for other
design aspects including sample size and power and provide some guidance on the
application of adaptive designs in this particular context.

  neural networks","On 19th March, the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. Through
this global spread, many nations have witnessed exponential growth of confirmed
cases brought under control by severe mass quarantine or lockdown measures.
However, some have, through a different timeline of actions, prevented this
exponential growth. Currently as some continue to tackle growth, others attempt
to safely lift restrictions whilst avoiding a resurgence. This study seeks to
quantify the impact of government actions in mitigating viral transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 by a novel soft computing approach that makes concurrent use of a
neural network model, to predict the daily slope increase of cumulative
infected, and an optimiser, with a parametrisation of the government
restriction time series, to understanding the best set of mitigating actions.
Data for two territories, Italy and Taiwan, have been gathered to model
government restrictions in traveling, testing and enforcement of social
distance measures as well as people connectivity and adherence to government
actions. It is found that a larger and earlier testing campaign with tighter
entry restrictions benefit both regions, resulting in significantly less
confirmed cases. Interestingly, this scenario couples with an earlier but
milder implementation of nationwide restrictions for Italy, thus supporting
Taiwan's lack of nationwide lockdown. The results, found with a purely
data-driven approach, are in line with the main findings of mathematical
epidemiological models, proving that the proposed approach has value and that
the data alone contains valuable knowledge to inform decision makers.

previous efforts to combine basic epidemiology models (e.g. SIR - Susceptible,
Infected, and Recovered) with game and economy theory tools. We present an
extension of the SIR model that predicts a series of discontinuous transitions
in social distancing. Each transition resembles a phase transition of the
second-order (Ginzburg-Landau instability) and, therefore, potentially a
general phenomenon. The first wave of COVID-19 led to social distancing around
the globe: severe lockdowns to stop the pandemic were followed by a series of
lockdown lifts. Data analysis of the first wave in Austria, Israel, and Germany
corroborates the soundness of the model. Furthermore, this work presents
analytical tools to analyze pandemic waves, which may be extended to calculate
derivatives of giant components in network percolation transitions and may also
be of interest in the context of crisis formation theories.

protection method for people is to wear masks in public areas. Furthermore,
many public service providers require customers to use the service only if they
wear masks correctly. However, there are only a few research studies about face
mask detection based on image analysis. In this paper, we propose
RetinaFaceMask, which is a high-accuracy and efficient face mask detector. The
proposed RetinaFaceMask is a one-stage detector, which consists of a feature
pyramid network to fuse high-level semantic information with multiple feature
maps, and a novel context attention module to focus on detecting face masks. In
addition, we also propose a novel cross-class object removal algorithm to
reject predictions with low confidences and the high intersection of union.
Experiment results show that RetinaFaceMask achieves state-of-the-art results
on a public face mask dataset with $2.3\%$ and $1.5\%$ higher than the baseline
result in the face and mask detection precision, respectively, and $11.0\%$ and
$5.9\%$ higher than baseline for recall. Besides, we also explore the
possibility of implementing RetinaFaceMask with a light-weighted neural network

provide information such as an individual's Covid-19 vaccination history and
adverse symptom reaction history to judge their potential impact on the overall

benefit regions with equitable internet access and lower technological divide.

show more than 80 percent of infected had a mild case of disease, while around
14 percent of infected experienced a severe one and about 5 percent are
categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (2020-03-12; daily
updates in the prepared website) shows the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in
China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran are 80932, 7869, 12462 and 10075;
respectively. Calculating the total Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of Italy
(2020-03-04), about 7.9% of confirmed cases passed away. Compared to South
Korea's rate of 0.76% (10 times lower than Italy) and China's 3.8% (50% lower
than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. There are some effective policies
that yield significant changes in the trend of cases. The lockdown policy in
China and Italy (the effect observed after 11 days), Shutdown of all
nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined
policy in South Korea and reducing working hours in Iran.

  Screening for COVID-19","Background: Rapid testing for an infection is paramount during a pandemic to
prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study
aimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample
pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2.
  Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six
different testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate,
test characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations
in five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19
outbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and
testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised
prior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of
cases identified; and number of false positives.
  Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input
parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen
one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when
prioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised
testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the
US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight
times faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are
considerably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex
pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also
reduces the number of false positive diagnoses by 50%.
  Interpretation: The results of this study provide a clear rationale for
adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of
testing for SARS-CoV-2. The current individual testing approach unnecessarily
wastes valuable time and resources.

  Images and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","COVID-19 is a global health problem. Consequently, early detection and
analysis of the infection patterns are crucial for controlling infection spread
as well as devising a treatment plan. This work proposes a two-stage deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based framework for delineation of
COVID-19 infected regions in Lung CT images. In the first stage, initially,
COVID-19 specific CT image features are enhanced using a two-level discrete
wavelet transformation. These enhanced CT images are then classified using the
proposed custom-made deep CoV-CTNet. In the second stage, the CT images
classified as infectious images are provided to the segmentation models for the
identification and analysis of COVID-19 infectious regions. In this regard, we
propose a novel semantic segmentation model CoV-RASeg, which systematically
uses average and max pooling operations in the encoder and decoder blocks. This
systematic utilization of max and average pooling operations helps the proposed
CoV-RASeg in simultaneously learning both the boundaries and region
homogeneity. Moreover, the idea of attention is incorporated to deal with
mildly infected regions. The proposed two-stage framework is evaluated on a
standard Lung CT image dataset, and its performance is compared with the
existing deep CNN models. The performance of the proposed CoV-CTNet is
evaluated using Mathew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) measure (0.98) and that of
proposed CoV-RASeg using Dice Similarity (DS) score (0.95). The promising
results on an unseen test set suggest that the proposed framework has the
potential to help the radiologists in the identification and analysis of
COVID-19 infected regions.

Vitamin D and Quercetin as promising pandemic mitigation agents. Gene

represent viable candidates for further assessment and considerations of their

  different evolutionary models","The SIR evolutionary model predicts too sharp a decrease of the fractions of
people infected with COVID-19 in France after the start of the national
lockdown, compared to what is observed. I fit the daily hospital data: arrivals
in regular and critical care units, releases and deaths, using extended SEIR
models. These involve ratios of evolutionary timescales to branching fractions,
assumed uniform throughout a country, and the basic reproduction number, $R_0$,
before and during the national lockdown, for each region of France. The
joint-region Bayesian analysis allows precise evaluations of the time/fraction
ratios and pre-hospitalized fractions. The hospital data are well fit by the
models, except the arrivals in critical care, which decrease faster than
predicted, indicating better treatment over time. Averaged over France, the
analysis yields $R_0$= 3.4$\pm$0.1 before the lockdown and 0.65$\pm$0.04 (90%
c.l.) during the lockdown, with small regional variations. On 11 May 2020, the
Infection Fatality Rate in France was 4 $\pm$1% (90% c.l.), while the Feverish
vastly outnumber the Asymptomatic, contrary to the early phases. Without the
lockdown nor social distancing, over 2 million deaths from COVID-19 would have
occurred throughout France, while a lockdown that would have been enforced 10
days earlier would have led to less than 1000 deaths. The fraction of immunized
people reached a plateau below 1% throughout France (3% in Paris) by late April
2020 (95% c.l.), suggesting a lack of herd immunity. The widespread
availability of face masks on 11 May, when the lockdown was partially lifted,
should keep $R_0$ below unity if at least 46% of the population wear them
outside their home. Otherwise, without enhanced other social distancing, a
second wave is inevitable and cause the number of deaths to triple between
early May and October (if $R_0$=1.2) or even late June (if $R_0$=2).

disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week
that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of
cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the
first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western
Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of
confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds,
dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results,
hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction
number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than
February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the
epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The
median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of
positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care.
The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We
estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We
estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around
February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in
nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of
COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely
unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We
observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with
an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive
containment strategies are required to control COVID-19 spread and catastrophic
outcomes for the healthcare system.

  and Florida Line-Level Data","Since the COVID-19 pandemic first reached the United States, the case
fatality rate has fallen precipitously. Several possible explanations have been
floated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing,
shifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and
reported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and
decreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level
data and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April
1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each
stratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the
hypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to
decreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in
the national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the
national data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second
wave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR.
By contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second
peak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first
and second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by
November 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in
age-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding
factors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic
picture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis
is that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by
artifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but
also the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified
line-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.

COVID-19 scenario are modeled and tested. All three scenarios have the same
number of components, connections and the same driver components. Only the
initial state vectors are different and the internal correlations are weighted
differently. This allows for comparing all three scenarios on an equal basis.
The mental modeler software is used (Gray et al. 2013). This paper presents one
of the first applications of FCMs in the context of digital transformation. It
is shown, that the traditional growth-oriented scenario is structurally very
similar to the current COVID-19 scenario. The current pandemic is able to
accelerate digital transformation to a certain extent. But the pandemic does
not guarantee for a distinct sustainable and innovative future development.
Only by changing the initial state vectors and the weights of the connections
an innovative and sustainable turnaround in a third scenario becomes possible.

  Large Multicenter Cohort","Objectives: To investigate machine-learning classifiers and interpretable
models using chest CT for detection of COVID-19 and differentiation from other
pneumonias, ILD and normal CTs.
  Methods: Our retrospective multi-institutional study obtained 2096 chest CTs
from 16 institutions (including 1077 COVID-19 patients). Training/testing
cohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and
559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification
of COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and
random forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D
features extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of
airspace opacities.
  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace
opacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the
typical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering compares feature distribution across COVID-19 and
control cohorts. The metrics-based classifier achieved AUC=0.83,
sensitivity=0.74, and specificity=0.79 of versus respectively 0.93, 0.90, and
0.83 for the DL-based classifier. Most of ambiguity comes from non-COVID-19
pneumonia with manifestations that overlap with COVID-19, as well as mild
COVID-19 cases. Non-COVID-19 classification performance is 91% for ILD, 64% for
other pneumonias and 94% for no pathologies, which demonstrates the robustness
of our method against different compositions of control groups.
  Conclusions: Our new method accurately discriminates COVID-19 from other
types of pneumonia, ILD, and no pathologies CTs, using quantitative imaging
features derived from chest CT, while balancing interpretability of results and
classification performance, and therefore may be useful to facilitate diagnosis
of COVID-19.

  for Interpretable Prognosis","Due to the characteristics of COVID-19, the epidemic develops rapidly and
overwhelms health service systems worldwide. Many patients suffer from systemic
life-threatening problems and need to be carefully monitored in ICUs. Thus the
intelligent prognosis is in an urgent need to assist physicians to take an
early intervention, prevent the adverse outcome, and optimize the medical
resource allocation. However, in the early stage of the epidemic outbreak, the
data available for analysis is limited due to the lack of effective diagnostic
mechanisms, rarity of the cases, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we
propose a deep-learning-based approach, CovidCare, which leverages the existing
electronic medical records to enhance the prognosis for inpatients with
emerging infectious diseases. It learns to embed the COVID-19-related medical
features based on massive existing EMR data via transfer learning. The
transferred parameters are further trained to imitate the teacher model's
representation behavior based on knowledge distillation, which embeds the
health status more comprehensively in the source dataset. We conduct the length
of stay prediction experiments for patients on a real-world COVID-19 dataset.
The experiment results indicate that our proposed model consistently
outperforms the comparative baseline methods. CovidCare also reveals that, 1)
hs-cTnI, hs-CRP and Platelet Counts are the most fatal biomarkers, whose
abnormal values usually indicate emergency adverse outcome. 2) Normal values of
gamma-GT, AP and eGFR indicate the overall improvement of health. The medical
findings extracted by CovidCare are empirically confirmed by human experts and
medical literatures.

children play a key role in the spreading of COVID-19. Interestingly, we show
that children's testing might be an important tool to flatten the epidemic

classes in which infected students are detected. Finally, we test a vaccination
strategy that prioritizes the members of large families and we demonstrate its
good performance. We believe that our modeling framework and our findings could

  Annotation-Efficient COVID-19 CT Lung Infection Segmentation","The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has
spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries.
Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an
important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major
challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently,
there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing
the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19
segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven
collaborative learning model for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung
infection segmentation. The network consists of encoders with the same
architecture and a shared decoder. The general encoder is adopted to capture
general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, while the
target encoder is adopted to focus on task-specific features of COVID-19
infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated
for the subsequent decoder part. To thoroughly exploit shared knowledge between
COVID and non-COVID lesions, we develop a collaborative learning scheme to
regularize the relation consistency between extracted features of given input.
Other than existing consistency-based methods that simply enforce the
consistency of individual predictions, our method enforces the consistency of
feature relation among samples, encouraging the model to explore semantic
information from both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases. Extensive experiments on
one public COVID-19 dataset and two public non-COVID datasets show that our
method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with existing
methods in the absence of sufficient high-quality COVID-19 annotations.

recent years. Yet, the practical model production and further research of deep
face recognition are in great need of corresponding public support. For
example, the production of face representation network desires a modular
training scheme to consider the proper choice from various candidates of
state-of-the-art backbone and training supervision subject to the real-world
face recognition demand; for performance analysis and comparison, the standard
and automatic evaluation with a bunch of models on multiple benchmarks will be
a desired tool as well; besides, a public groundwork is welcomed for deploying
the face recognition in the shape of holistic pipeline. Furthermore, there are
some newly-emerged challenges, such as the masked face recognition caused by
the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, which draws increasing attention in
practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an
easy-to-use unified framework to meet the above demands. To this end, we

management of their own safety during an epidemic or pandemic such as COVID-19
by enabling them to view, in advance, the risks they would take if they visit
some given venue (a cafe, the gym, the workplace, the park,...) and,
furthermore, track the accumulation of such risks during the course of any
given day or week. This idea can be presented to users of the app as counting
points. One point represents some constant probability, $p_\text{point}$, of
infection. Then the app would work in a similar way to a calorie counting app
(instead of counting calories we count probability increments of being
infected). Government could set a maximum recommended number of daily (or
weekly) points available to each user in accord with its objectives (bringing
the disease under control, allowing essential workers to work, protecting
vulnerable individuals, ...). It is posited that this, along with other
proposed ""levers"" would allow government to manage a gradual transition to
normalcy. I discuss a circuit framework with wires running between boxes. In
this framework the wires represent possible sources of infection, namely
individuals and the venues themselves (through deposits of pathogens left at
the venue). The boxes represent interactions of these sources (when individuals
visit a venue). This circuit framework allows (i) calculation of points cost
for visiting venues and (ii) probabilistic contact tracing. The points systems
proposed here could complement existing contact tracing apps by adding
functionality to permit users to participate in decision making up front.

STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal
episodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs
can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the
episodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the
effectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is

results based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model
is able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and
efficiency.

the differences in assessments by dividing students into two groups. The first
group (control) corresponds to academic years 2017/2018 and 2018/2019. The
second group (experimental) corresponds to students from 2019/2020, which is
the group of students that interrupted their face-to-face activities because of
the confinement. The results show that there is a significant positive effect
of the COVID-19 confinement on students performance. This effect is also
significative in activities that did not change their format when performed
after the confinement. We find that this effect is significative both in
subjects that increased the number of assessment activities and subjects that
did not change the workload of students. Additionally, an analysis of students
learning strategies before confinement shows that students did not study in a
continuous basis. Based on these results, we conclude that COVID-19 confinement
changed students learning strategies to a more continuous habit, improving
their efficiency. For these reasons, better scores in students assessment are
expected due to COVID-19 confinement that can be explained by an improvement in
their learning performance.

in recent decades caused by geopolitical upheavals such as Brexit and now,
COVID-19. The way in which policy makers respond to the current pandemic could
have large effects on how the world looks after the pandemic subsides. We aim
to investigate complex questions post COVID-19 around the relationships and
intersections concerning nationalism, religiosity, and anti-immigrant sentiment
from a socio-cognitive perspective by applying a mixed-method approach (survey
and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion threats have caused
huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature
on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the
role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can
fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's
life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's
life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural
disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing).
These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and
other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist
and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin
to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our
theoretical framework and explore the different possible relationships in an
online sample. The second is a study of a computer simulation. Both studies
(completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables,

  in Lebanon","In this paper, we develop a probabilistic mathematical model for the spread
of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). It takes into account the known special
characteristics of this disease such as the existence of infectious undetected
cases and the different social and infectiousness conditions of infected
people. In particular, it considers the social structure and governmental
measures in a country, the fraction of detected cases over the real total
infected cases, and the influx of undetected infected people from outside the
borders. Although the model is simple and allows a reasonable identification of
its parameters, using the data provided by local authorities on this pandemic,
it is also complex enough to capture the most important effects. We study the
particular case of Lebanon and use its reported data to estimate the model
parameters, which can be of interest for estimating the spread of COVID-19 in
other countries. We show a good agreement between the reported data and the
estimations given by our model. We also simulate several scenarios that help
policy makers in deciding how to loosen different measures without risking a
severe wave of COVID-19. We are also able to identify the main factors that
lead to specific scenarios which helps in a better understanding of the spread
of the virus.

COVID-19 and the excess mortality associated with the pandemic, across the
European NUTS3 regions and US counties. Both in Europe and in the US, the
pandemic arrived earlier and recorded higher Rt values in urban regions than in
intermediate and rural ones. A similar gap is also found in the data on excess
mortality. In the weeks during the first phase of the pandemic, urban regions
in EU countries experienced excess mortality of up to 68pp more than rural
ones. We show that, during the initial days of the pandemic, territorial
differences in Rt by the degree of urbanisation can be largely explained by the
level of internal, inbound and outbound mobility. The differences in the spread
of COVID-19 by rural-urban typology and the role of mobility are less clear
during the second wave. This could be linked to the fact that the infection is
widespread across territories, to changes in mobility patterns during the
summer period as well as to the different containment measures which reverse
the causality between mobility and Rt.

transparency and liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the
external price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as
domestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging
strategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this
risk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk
Meter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior
embedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil,
Russia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the
financial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in
addition to the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM
sovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned
countries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its
maximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the
Macro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We
then study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network
behavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose
the suitable market for in-vestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For
that purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies
and FRM network centrality is developed. We propose a robust and

mass of studies for lung infection segmentation from CT images. Though many
methods have been proposed for this issue, it is a challenging task because of
infections of various size appearing in different lobe zones. To tackle these
issues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR)
module, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint
infections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph
convolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe
zones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability,
we propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related
pixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware
features are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream
tasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to
handle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range
contextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play,
which can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance.
Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method consistently boost the
performance of state-of-the-art backbone architectures on both of public and

  model-based predictions with large under-reporting","The COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2 virus) is the defying global health crisis
of our time. The absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of
asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic in
Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected
individuals and deaths. We propose an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model which explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response
of the population to public policies (such as confinement measures, widespread
use of masks, etc) to cast short-term and long-term predictions. Large amounts
of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions. In this paper,
we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction, which is illustrated
regarding three key aspects. First, assuming that the number of infected
individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the
peak of infection. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected
individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both
symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the
peak of symptomatic. Second, considering that the actual amount of deaths is
larger than what is being register, then demonstrate the increase of the
mortality rates. Third, when consider generally under-reported data, we
demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change
qualitatively and quantitatively. We also investigate the effect of the
""COVID-19 under-reporting tripod"", i.e. the under-reporting in terms of
infected individuals, of deaths and the true mortality rate. If two of these
factors are known, the remainder can be inferred, as long as proportions are
kept constant. The proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of
uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates.

experts to the outbreak. X-ray imaging, although limited to specific
visualizations, may be helpful for the diagnosis. Deep Learning has proven to
be a remarkable method to extract massive high-dimensional features from
medical images. Specifically, in this paper, the state-of-the-art Convolutional
Neural Network called Mobile Net is employed and trained from scratch to
investigate the importance of the extracted features for the classification
task. A large-scale dataset of 3905 X-Ray images, corresponding to 6 diseases
is utilized for training MobileNet v2, which has been proven to achieve
remarkable results in related tasks. The results suggest that training CNNs
from scratch may reveal vital biomarkers related but not limited to the
COVID-19 disease, while an overall classification accuracy of the seven classes
reaches 87.66%. Besides, this method achieves 99.18% accuracy, 97.36%
Sensitivity, and 99.42% Specificity in the detection of COVID-19.

that there exists a proportion of the population who are not susceptible to
infection -- even at the start of the current pandemic. This paper introduces a
model of the immune response to a virus. This is based upon the same sort of
mean-field dynamics as used in epidemiology. However, in place of the location,
clinical status, and other attributes of people in an epidemiological model, we
consider the state of a virus, B and T-lymphocytes, and the antibodies they
generate. Our aim is to formalise some key hypotheses as to the mechanism of
resistance. We present a series of simple simulations illustrating changes to
the dynamics of the immune response under these hypotheses. These include
attenuated viral cell entry, pre-existing cross-reactive humoral
(antibody-mediated) immunity, and enhanced T-cell dependent immunity. Finally,
we illustrate the potential application of this sort of model by illustrating
variational inversion (using simulated data) of this model to illustrate its
use in testing hypotheses. In principle, this furnishes a fast and efficient
immunological assay--based on sequential serology--that provides a (i)
quantitative measure of latent immunological responses and (ii) a Bayes optimal
classification of the different kinds of immunological response (c.f., glucose
tolerance tests used to test for insulin resistance). This may be especially
useful in assessing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

  COVID-19 patients on an Indian cohort","Many countries are now experiencing the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
straining the healthcare resources with an acute shortage of hospital beds and
ventilators for the critically ill patients. This situation is especially worse
in India with the second largest load of COVID-19 cases and a relatively
resource-scarce medical infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes essential to
triage the patients based on the severity of their disease and devote resources
towards critically ill patients. Yan et al. 1 have published a very pertinent
research that uses Machine learning (ML) methods to predict the outcome of
COVID-19 patients based on their clinical parameters at the day of admission.
They used the XGBoost algorithm, a type of ensemble model, to build the
mortality prediction model. The final classifier is built through the
sequential addition of multiple weak classifiers. The clinically operable
decision rule was obtained from a 'single-tree XGBoost' and used lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hs-CRP) values. This decision tree achieved a 100% survival prediction and 81%
mortality prediction. However, these models have several technical challenges
and do not provide an out of the box solution that can be deployed for other
populations as has been reported in the ""Matters Arising"" section of Yan et al.
Here, we show the limitations of this model by deploying it on one of the
largest datasets of COVID-19 patients containing detailed clinical parameters
collected from India.

diagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection
measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on
radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data
systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we
explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a
single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological
images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called
CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given
condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our
CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of
COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution
radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep
classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from
CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results
are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely
small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data
augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset
(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the
performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on
large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19
diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

suspension of on-campus education. The 'Maker Lab' course, in which students
conceive and set up their own experiments using affordable microcontrollers,
required students to follow the entire arc of an empirical research cycle
twice. The decision for and facilitation of such open-inquiry projects was
based on and warranted by the literature on teaching the process of
experimental research and methods of scientific research. The flipped classroom
approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the
students' actual experiments were carried out independently at home or
elsewhere without the in-person supervision of an instructor. Despite the
COVID-19 measures, all students were able to produce interesting and successful

the abrupt transition to online teaching, we found several counterbalancing
advantages that bear consideration for inclusion even when all teaching
activities can return to campus. We believe that three components in the design

the flipped aspect of the instruction methods. We also include considerations
for adapting these pandemic-resilient methods in other courses and programs.

resources, making rapid and accurate triage of patients presenting to emergency
departments a necessity. Machine learning techniques using clinical data such

deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse event deterioration (i.e.,
transfer to the intensive care unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased
oxygen requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity of
COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage supervised pretraining on
related non-COVID images, but this is limited by the differences between the
pretraining data and the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use
self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) method in the
pretraining phase to learn more general image representations to use for
downstream tasks. We present three results. The first is deterioration
prediction from a single image, where our model achieves an area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting an adverse event
within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with supervised pretraining) and an AUC of
0.765 for predicting oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours

terms of loss of lives, economic decline, travel restrictions, trade deficit,
and collapsing economy including real-estate, job loss, loss of health
benefits, the decline in quality of access to care and services and overall
quality of life. Immunization from the anticipated vaccines will not be the
stand-alone guideline that will help surpass the pandemic and return to
normalcy. Four pillars of effective public health intervention include
diagnostic testing for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, contact
tracing, quarantine of individuals with symptoms or who are exposed to
COVID-19, and maintaining strict hygiene standards at the individual and
community level. Digital technology, currently being used for COVID-19 testing
include certain mobile apps, web dashboards, and online self-assessment tools.
Herein, we look into various digital solutions adapted by communities across
universities, businesses, and other organizations. We summarize the challenges
experienced using these tools in terms of quality of information, privacy, and
user-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and being
developed, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of both
quality and quantity, which can be overwhelming to the users. Understanding the
testing landscape through a digital lens will give a clear insight into the
multiple challenges that we face including data privacy, cost, and
miscommunication. It is the destiny of digitalization to navigate testing for
COVID-19. Block-chain based systems can be used for privacy preservation and
ensuring ownership of the data to remain with the user. Another solution
involves having digital health passports with relevant and correct information.
In this early draft, we summarize the challenges and propose possible solutions
to address the same.

  Smartphone Embedded Sensors: Design Study","Coronaviruses are a famous family of viruses that cause illness in both
humans and animals. The new type of coronavirus COVID-19 was firstly discovered
in Wuhan, China. However, recently, the virus has widely spread in most of the
world and causing a pandemic according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the
COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect coronavirus including clinical
analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19
patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several
techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as
medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost, taking
time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is
proposed to detect COVID-19 using built-in smartphone sensors. The proposal
provides a low-cost solution, since most of radiologists have already held
smartphones for different daily-purposes. Not only that but also ordinary
people can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection
purposes. Nowadays Smartphones are powerful with existing computation-rich
processors, memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras,
microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor,
humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial

measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as
predicting the result of the disease.

it is becoming laborious to conduct the tests with the available testing kits

a scheme for containing an outbreak in a city that consists in adding an extra

coupled compartment model with stochastic noise to simulate a localized
outbreak that is partially isolated and analyze its evolution with and without

case counts of COVID-19 patients reported by local health administrations from
different Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) within the US to parametrize a
model that well describes the propagation of the disease in each area. We then
introduce a time-varying control input that represents the level of social
distancing imposed on the population of a given area and solve an optimal
control problem with the goal of minimizing the impact of social distancing on
the economy in the presence of relevant constraints, such as a desired level of
suppression for the epidemics at a terminal time. We find that with the
exception of the initial time and of the final time, the optimal control input
is well approximated by a constant, specific to each area, which contrasts with
the implemented system of reopening `in phases'. For all the areas considered,
this optimal level corresponds to stricter social distancing than the level
estimated from data. Proper selection of the time period for application of the
control action optimally is important: depending on the particular MSA this
period should be either short or long or intermediate. We also consider the
case that the transmissibility increases in time (due e.g. to increasingly
colder weather), for which we find that the optimal control solution yields
progressively stricter measures of social distancing. {We finally compute the
optimal control solution for a model modified to incorporate the effects of
vaccinations on the population and we see that depending on a number of

  Generation","Beyond the common difficulties faced in the natural image captioning, medical
report generation specifically requires the model to describe a medical image
with a fine-grained and semantic-coherence paragraph that should satisfy both
medical commonsense and logic. Previous works generally extract the global
image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to
referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the
regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area
of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be
considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are
many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal
regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely
to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To
address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge
Encoder-Decoder (ASGK) to mimic radiologists' working patterns. In more detail,
ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic
information to guide medical knowledge transfer and learning. The core
structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language
decoder, inspired by advanced Generative Pre-Training (GPT). Experiments on the
CX-CHR dataset and our COVID-19 CT Report dataset demonstrate that our proposed
ASGK is able to generate a robust and accurate report, and moreover outperforms

used by frontline health-care workers, and are typically meant for one-time
usage. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage
of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and
re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of
N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene
electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic
effects. This charge can degrade when the mask is used. Moreover, simple
decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) can degrade any remaining
charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration
efficiency post decontamination. In this report, we summarize our results on
the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and
filtration efficiency in N95 masks. In particular, we propose and show that it
is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination and recover filtration
efficiency.

non-pharmaceutical interventions, are unprecedented in scale and scope.
Epidemiologists are more involved in policy decisions and evidence generation
than ever before. However, policy impact evaluations always require a complex
combination of circumstance, study design, data, statistics, and analysis.
Beyond the issues that are faced for any policy, evaluation of COVID-19
policies is complicated by additional challenges related to infectious disease
dynamics and lags, lack of direct observation of key outcomes, and a
multiplicity of interventions occurring on an accelerated time scale. The
methods needed for policy-level impact evaluation are not often used or taught
in epidemiology, and differ in important ways that may not be obvious. The
volume and speed, and methodological complications of policy evaluations can
make it difficult for decision-makers and researchers to synthesize and
evaluate strength of evidence in COVID-19 health policy papers.
  In this paper, we (1) introduce the basic suite of policy impact evaluation
designs for observational data, including cross-sectional analyses, pre/post,
interrupted time-series, and difference-in-differences analysis, (2)
demonstrate key ways in which the requirements and assumptions underlying these
designs are often violated in the context of COVID-19, and (3) provide
decision-makers and reviewers a conceptual and graphical guide to identifying
these key violations. The overall goal of this paper is to help
epidemiologists, policy-makers, journal editors, journalists, researchers, and

world.In China, COVID-19 has caused severe consequences. Moreover, online
rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic increased people's panic about public
health and social stability. At present, understanding and curbing the spread
of online rumors is an urgent task. Therefore, we analyzed the rumor spreading
mechanism and propose a method to quantify a rumors' influence by the speed of
new insiders. The search frequency of the rumor is used as an observation
variable of new insiders. The peak coefficient and the attenuation coefficient
are calculated for the search frequency, which conforms to the exponential
distribution. We designed several rumor features and used the above two
coefficients as predictable labels. A 5-fold cross-validation experiment using
the mean square error (MSE) as the loss function showed that the decision tree
was suitable for predicting the peak coefficient, and the linear regression
model was ideal for predicting the attenuation coefficient. Our feature
analysis showed that precursor features were the most important for the
outbreak coefficient, while location information and rumor entity information
were the most important for the attenuation coefficient. Meanwhile, features
that were conducive to the outbreak were usually harmful to the continued
spread of rumors. At the same time, anxiety was a crucial rumor causing factor.
Finally, we discuss how to use deep learning technology to reduce the forecast
loss by using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

  Policy Assessment using Compartmental Gaussian Processes","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led many
countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the
outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and
whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public
discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different
lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and
informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper
develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown
policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point,
and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific
policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior --
the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,
Recovered) model as a prior mean function with ""country-and-policy-specific""
parameters that capture fatality curves under ""counterfactual"" policies within
each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and
learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and
its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of
SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and
gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors)
-- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational
inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with
other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide
scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting
their impact on COVID-19 fatalities.

  Biomedical Imaging","Despite the widespread use of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation
of images that are acquired from a single source, clinicians often use
multi-domain data for a detailed analysis. For instance, CT and MRI have
advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output
characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current
segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to
their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all
modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,
robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training
step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all
available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.
For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can
learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct
and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift
property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where
sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is

method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either

accompanying challenges emerge. One important challenge we face is to
efficiently and effectively use recently gathered data and find computational
tools to combat the COVID-19 infodemic, a typical information overloading
problem. Novel coronavirus presents many questions without ready answers; its
uncertainty and our eagerness in search of solutions offer a fertile
environment for infodemic. It is thus necessary to combat the infodemic and
make a concerted effort to confront COVID-19 and mitigate its negative impact
in all walks of life when saving lives and maintaining normal orders during
trying times. In this position paper of combating the COVID-19 infodemic, we
illustrate its need by providing real-world examples of rampant conspiracy
theories, misinformation, and various types of scams that take advantage of
human kindness, fear, and ignorance. We present three key challenges in this
fight against the COVID-19 infodemic where researchers and practitioners
instinctively want to contribute and help. We demonstrate that these three
challenges can and will be effectively addressed by collective wisdom,
crowdsourcing, and collaborative research.

variance explained by an affine combination of multiple explanatory covariates.
An attribution of this explanatory contribution to each of the individual
covariates is often sought in order to draw inference regarding the importance
of each covariate with respect to the response phenomenon. A recent method for
ascertaining such an attribution is via the game theoretic Shapley value
decomposition of the coefficient of determination. Such a decomposition has the
desirable efficiency, monotonicity, and equal treatment properties. Under a
weak assumption that the joint distribution is pseudo-elliptical, we obtain the
asymptotic normality of the Shapley values. We then utilize this result in
order to construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests regarding such
quantities. Monte Carlo studies regarding our results are provided. We found
that our asymptotic confidence intervals are computationally superior to
competing bootstrap methods and are able to improve upon the performance of
such intervals. In an expository application to Australian real estate price
modelling, we employ Shapley value confidence intervals to identify significant
differences between the explanatory contributions of covariates, between
models, which otherwise share approximately the same $R^2$ value. These
different models are based on real estate data from the same periods in 2019

connect with large Internet service providers (eyeball networks) through
dedicated private peering. The capacity of these private network interconnects
is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users.
Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a
content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect
may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the
excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are
rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet
service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and
disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid
by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic
overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be
able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs
and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based
on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short
term horizon of 2-6 hours and predict the specific interconnections that will
ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic
measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a
true-positive rate of 0.8 while maintaining a 0.05 false-positive rate. The
lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the overflow prediction
accuracy. Nevertheless, starting from the end of April 2020 with the gradual
lockdown release, the old models trained before the pandemic perform equally
well.

  Covid-19 infection numbers?","We derive an analytic expression describing how health costs and death counts
of the Covid-19 pandemic change over time as vaccination proceeds. Meanwhile,
the disease may continue to spread exponentially unless checked by Non
Pharmacological Interventions (NPI). The key factors are that the mortality
risk from a Covid-19 infection increases exponentially with age and that the
sizes of age cohorts decrease linearly at the top of the population pyramid.
Taking these factors into account, we derive an expression for a critical
threshold, which determines the minimal speed a vaccination campaign needs to
have in order to be able to keep fatalities from rising. Younger countries with
fast vaccination campaigns find it substantially easier to reach this threshold
than countries with aged population and slower vaccination. We find that for EU
countries it will take some time to reach this threshold, given that the new,
now dominant, mutations, have a significantly higher infection rate. The
urgency of accelerating vaccination is increased by early evidence that the new
strains also have a higher mortality risk. We also find that protecting the
over 60 years old, which constitute one quarter of the EU population, would
reduce the loss of live by 95 percent.

for 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of
volumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to

down the economy while staying within the capacity of the healthcare system. We
base our analysis on a detailed heterogeneous epidemiological model, which

including incubation, infection period, hospitalization, and treatment in the
intensive care unit (ICU). We model the healthcare capacity as the total number
of hospital and ICU beds for the whole country. We calibrate the model
parameters to data reported in several recent research papers. For high- and
low-risk population groups, we calculate the number of total and intensive care
hospitalizations, and deaths as functions of time. The main conclusion is that
countries, which enforce reasonable hygienic measures on time can avoid
lockdowns throughout the pandemic provided that the number of spare ICU beds
per million is above the threshold of about 100. In countries where the total
number of ICU beds is below this threshold, a limited period quarantine to
specific high-risk groups of the population suffices. Furthermore, in the case
of an inadequate capacity of the healthcare system, we incorporate a feedback
loop and demonstrate that quantitative impact of the lack of ICU units on the
death curve. In the case of inadequate ICU beds, full- and partial-quarantine
scenarios outcomes are almost identical, making it unnecessary to shut down the
whole economy. We conclude that only a limited-time quarantine of the high-risk
group might be necessary, while the rest of the economy can remain operational.

disruptions to many aspects of normal life. An important aspect in reducing the

effective method in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 is to wear masks.
Strict mask-wearing policies have been met with not only public sensation but

is computationally intensive and its efficiency in real-time face mask
detection is not ideal. Our research proposes a new approach to mask detection

crucial communication tool for information generation, dissemination, and
consumption. In this scoping review, we selected and examined peer-reviewed
empirical studies relating to COVID-19 and social media during the first

studies, we identified five overarching public health themes concerning the
role of online social platforms and COVID-19. These themes focused on: (i)
surveying public attitudes, (ii) identifying infodemics, (iii) assessing mental
health, (iv) detecting or predicting COVID-19 cases, (v) analyzing government
responses to the pandemic, and (vi) evaluating quality of health information in
prevention education videos. Furthermore, our review highlights the paucity of
studies on the application of machine learning on social media data related to
COVID-19 and a lack of studies documenting real-time surveillance developed
with social media data on COVID-19. For COVID-19, social media can play a
crucial role in disseminating health information as well as tackling infodemics

  in the US","Recent re-opening policies in the US, following a period of social distancing
measures, introduced a significant increase in daily COVID-19 infections,
calling for a roll-back or substantial revisiting of these policies in many
states. The situation is suggestive of difficulties modeling the impact of
partial distancing/re-opening policies on future epidemic spread for purposes
of choosing safe alternatives. More specifically, one needs to understand the
impact of manipulating the availability of social interaction venues (e.g.,
schools, workplaces, and retail establishments) on virus spread. We introduce a
model, inspired by social networks research, that answers the above question.
Our model compartmentalizes interaction venues into categories we call mixing
domains, enabling one to predict COVID-19 contagion trends in different
geographic regions under different what if assumptions on partial re-opening of
individual domains. We apply our model to several highly impacted states
showing (i) how accurately it predicts the extent of current resurgence (from
available policy descriptions), and (ii) what alternatives might be more
effective at mitigating the second wave. We further compare policies that rely
on partial venue closure to policies that espouse wide-spread periodic testing
instead (i.e., in lieu of social distancing). Our models predict that the
benefits of (mandatory) testing out-shadow the benefits of partial venue
closure, suggesting that perhaps more efforts should be directed to such a
mitigation strategy.

analyze which respiratory activities may drive the spread of specific
pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, influenza viruses, and
SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The results confirm the high relevance of vocalization for

industry despite various protective measures, and temperature and ventilation
conditions were considered as possible high-risk factors. This cross-sectional
study examined meat and poultry plants to examine possible risk factors.
Companies completed a self-administered questionnaire on the work environment
and protective measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable
logistic regression analysis adjusted for the possibility to distance at least
1.5 meters, break rules, and employment status was performed to identify risk
factors associated with COVID-19 cases. Twenty-two meat and poultry plants with
19,072 employees participated. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the seven plants
with more than 10 cases was 12.1% and was highest in the deboning and meat
cutting area with 16.1%. A subsample analysis where information on maximal
ventilation rate per employee was available revealed an effect for ventilation
rate (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.996, 95% CI 0.993-0.999). When including
temperature as an interaction term in the working area, the effect of the
ventilation rate did not change. Increasing room temperatures resulted in a
lower chance of obtaining a positive COVID-19 test result (AOR 0.90 95% CI
0.82-0.99), and a 0.1% greater chance of a positive COVID-19 test for the
interaction term (AOR 1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.003). Our results further indicate
that climate conditions and low outdoor air flow are factors that can promote
the spread of SARS-CoV-2 aerosols. A possible requirement for pandemic
mitigation strategies in industrial workplace settings is to increase the
ventilation rate.

  of COVID-19","Public transport ridership around the world has been hit hard by the COVID-19
pandemic. Travellers are likely to adapt their behaviour to avoid the risk of
transmission and these changes may even be sustained after the pandemic. To
evaluate travellers' behaviour in public transport networks during these times
and assess how they will respond to future changes in the pandemic, we conduct
a stated choice experiment with train travellers in the Netherlands. We
specifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of
COVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii)
prevalent infection rate.
  Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals
two, nearly equally sized traveller segments: 'COVID Conscious' and 'Infection
Indifferent'. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding,
accepting, on average 8.75 minutes extra waiting time to reduce one person
on-board. Moreover, they demonstrate a strong desire to sit without anybody in
their neighbouring seat and are quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent
infection rate. By contrast, Infection Indifferent travellers' value of
crowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) is only slightly higher than
pre-pandemic estimates and they are relatively unaffected by infection rates.
We find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious
while those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic
tend to be Infection Indifferent. Further analysis also reveals differences
between the two segments in attitudes towards the pandemic and self-reported
rule-following behaviour. The behavioural insights from this study will not
only contribute to better demand forecasting for service planning but will also
inform public transport policy decisions aimed at curbing the shift to private
modes.

  infection-dependent mitigation strategies","Transmission rates in epidemic outbreaks may vary over time depending on the
societal response. Non-pharmacological mitigation strategies such as social
distancing and the adoption of protective equipment aim precisely at reducing
transmission rates by reducing infectious contacts. To investigate the effects
of mitigation strategies on the evolution of epidemics, nonlinear transmission
rates that are influenced by the levels of infections, deaths or recoveries
have been included in many variants of the classical SIR model. This class of
models is particularly relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic, in which the
population behavior has been affected by the unprecedented abundance and rapid
distribution of global infection and death data through online platforms. This
manuscript revisits a SIR model in which the reduction of transmission rate is
due to knowledge of infections. Through a mean field approach that assumes
individuals behave like molecules in a well-mixed solution, one derives a
time-varying reproduction number that depends on infection information through
a negative feedback term that is equivalent to Holling type II functions in
ecology and Michaelis-Menten functions in chemistry and molecular biology. A
step-by-step derivation of the model is provided, together with an overview of
methods for its qualitative analysis, showing that negative feedback
structurally reduces the peak of infections. At the same time, feedback may
substantially extend the duration of an epidemic. Computational simulations
agree with the analytical predictions, and further suggest that infection peak
reduction persists even in the presence of information delays. If the
mitigation strategy is linearly proportional to infections, a single parameter
is added to the SIR model, making it useful to illustrate the effects of
infection-dependent social distancing.

become an urgent need in this pandemic situation of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in

challenge due to the discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in

network model for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 disease from the chest

30-layered CNN model (named as CovNet30) during the training, and obtained
sub-models are stacked together using logistic regression. The proposed CNN
model combines the discriminating power of the different CNN`s sub-models and
classifies chest X-ray images into COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia classes. In
addition, we generate X-ray images dataset referred to as COVID19CXr, which
includes 2764 chest x-ray images of 1768 patients from the three publicly
available data repositories. The proposed stacked CNN achieves an accuracy of
92.74%, the sensitivity of 93.33%, PPV of 92.13%, and F1-score of 0.93 for the

  To Detect The Delayed Life-Threatening Hypoxaemia in COVID-19","Non-invasive ambulatory estimation of blood oxygen saturation has emerged as
an important clinical requirement to detect hypoxemia in the delayed
post-infective phase of COVID-19, where dangerous hypoxia may occur in the
absence of subjective breathlessness. This immediate clinical driver, combined
with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse
oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand
into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the
near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2
measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring,
and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the
conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we
found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites,
with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the
simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and
index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in
response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a
range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this
response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also
explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood
oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude,
and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in
conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to
temperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being
both convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for
continuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and
everyday-life settings.

COVID-19 crisis. Some of those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons
from mobile devices to build a record of proximate encounters between a pair of
device owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false positive
and re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's
difficulty in mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker
leveraging a moderately successful app or SDK with Bluetooth and location
access can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing systems at no
hardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app
or SDK installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a
good position to execute such attacks. We further present a novel attack, which
we call a biosurveillance attack, which allows the attacker to monitor the
exposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who does
not use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted
out of the system.
  Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize
precisely the behaviour of one such SDK that we found in a handful of
apps---but installed on more than one hundred million mobile devices. Its
behaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or
biosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with
minimal effort. We also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position
conducive to such attacks, by leveraging the lax logic for granting permissions
to apps in the Android framework: any app with some geolocation permission
could acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without
any additional user prompt. Finally we discuss motives for conducting such
attacks.

coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. It was first reported on in early December 2019 in
Wuhan, China and within three month spread as a pandemic around the whole
globe. Here, we study macro-epidemiological patterns along the time course of
the pandemic. We compute the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases and
deaths for countries worldwide and for counties in the US, and show that both
distributions follow a truncated power-law over five orders of magnitude. We
are able to explain the origin of this scaling behavior as a dual-scale
process: the large-scale spread of the virus between countries and the
small-scale accumulation of case numbers within each country. Assuming
exponential growth on both scales, the critical exponent of the power-law is
determined by the ratio of large-scale to small-scale growth rates. We confirm
this theory in numerical simulations in a simple meta-population model,
describing the epidemic spread in a network of interconnected countries. Our
theory gives a mechanistic explanation why most COVID-19 cases occurred within
a few epicenters, at least in the initial phase of the outbreak. Assessing how
well a simple dual-scale model predicts the early spread of epidemics, despite
the huge contrasts between countries, could help identify critical temporal and

to train deep classification models, transfer learning is a promising approach
by transferring knowledge from the abundant typical pneumonia datasets for
COVID-19 image classification. However, negative transfer may deteriorate the
performance due to the feature distribution divergence between two datasets and
task semantic difference in diagnosing pneumonia and COVID-19 that rely on
different characteristics. It is even more challenging when the target dataset
has no labels available, i.e., unsupervised task transfer learning. In this
paper, we propose a novel Task Adaptation Network (TAN) to solve this
unsupervised task transfer problem. In addition to learning transferable
features via domain-adversarial training, we propose a novel task semantic
adaptor that uses the learning-to-learn strategy to adapt the task semantics.
Experiments on three public COVID-19 datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves superior performance. Especially on COVID-DA dataset, TAN
significantly increases the recall and F1 score by 5.0% and 7.8% compared to
recently strong baselines. Moreover, we show that TAN also achieves superior
performance on several public domain adaptation benchmarks.

that two nodes are connected decays with their distance as a power law. As the
exponent of the distance dependence grows, model networks smoothly transition

less frequent. The spreading dynamics is influenced by the distance-dependence
exponent as well and changes from exponential growth to power-law growth. The
observed power-law growth is compatible with recent analyses of empirical data

gender differences. The results show that females are more likely to tweet
about the virus in the context of family, social distancing and healthcare

  post-lockdown COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives on India","Several countries that have been successful in constraining the severity of
COVID-19 pandemic via ""lockdown"" are now considering to slowly end it, mainly
because of enormous socio-economic side-effects. An abrupt ending of lockdown
can increase the basic reproductive number and undo everything; therefore,
carefully designed exit strategies are needed to sustain its benefits post
upliftment. To study the role of fear conditioning on mitigating the spread of
COVID-19 in post-lockdown phase, in this work, we propose an age- and social
contact- structures dependent Susceptible, Feared, Exposed, Infected and
Recovered (SFEIR) model. Simulating the SFEIR model on Indian population with
fear conditioning via mass media (like, television, community radio, internet
and print media) along with positive reinforcement, it is found that increase
in fraction of feared people results in the significant decrease in the growth
of infected population. The present study suggests that, during post-lockdown
phase, media induced fear conditioning in conjunction with closure of schools
for about one more year can serve as an important non-pharmaceutical
intervention to substantially mitigate this pandemic in India. The proposed
SFEIR model, by quantifying the influence of media in inducing fear
conditioning, underlies the importance of community driven changes in country

incidence curve of COVID-19 during the first half of 2020, they face the
challenge of resuming their social and economic activity. The rapid airborne
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for active
containment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best
strategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist in
testing the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, and
treat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that better
describes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion
process that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential
contagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the
dynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We
develop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number
$R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and
suppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between the
infection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited
to symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not
bended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too,
the strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitative
results are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most important
indicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity to
reverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.

  COVID-19 disease","By the end of 2020, a year since the first cases of infection by the Covid-19
virus have been reported, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Several
pharmaceutical companies made significant progress in developing effective
vaccines against the Covid-19 virus that has claimed the lives of more than a
million people over the world. On the other hand, there is growing evidence of
re-infection by the virus, which can cause further outbreaks. In this paper, we
apply statistical physics tools to examine the vaccination rate required to
control the pandemic for three different vaccine efficiency scenarios. Also, we
study the effect of temporal restrictions/reliefs on the pandemic's outbreak,
assuming that re-infection is possible. When examining the efficiency of the
vaccination rate of the general population in preventing an additional outbreak
of the disease, we find that a high vaccination rate (where at least 0.3% of
the population is vaccinated daily, which is equivalent to ~ 1 million vaccine
doses in the United States daily) is required to gain control over the spread
of the virus without further restrictions. Due to feasible limitations on the
vaccination rate, the vaccination process should be accompanied by the
prevailing restrictions until most of the population is vaccinated.

  epidemics with specific application to COVID-19","In the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, much work has been performed on
the development of mathematical models for the simulation of the epidemic, and
of disease models generally. Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed
(SIR) compartmental framework, modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary
differential equations. Alternative formulations using a partial differential
equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also
been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful
descriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new
variation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The
dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to
incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a
natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering
advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the
need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed
individuals) to incorporate time delays. Here, we introduce a DDE epidemic
model in both an ordinary- and partial differential equation framework. We
present a series of mathematical results assessing the stability of the
formulation. We then perform several numerical experiments, validating both the
mathematical results and establishing model's ability to reproduce measured
data on realistic problems.

  and facemask over 27 weeks of pandemic in Seoul, South Korea","Battle with COVID-19 turned out to be a marathon, not a sprint, and
behavioral adjustments have been unavoidable to stay viable. In this paper, we
employ a data-centric approach to investigate individual mobility adaptations
and mask-wearing in Seoul, South Korea. We first identify six epidemic phases
and two waves based on COVID-19 case count and its geospatial dispersion. The
phase-specific linear models reveal the strong, self-driven mobility reductions
in the first escalation and peak with a common focus on public transit use and
less-essential weekend/afternoon trips. However, comparable reduction was not
present in the second wave, as the shifted focus from mobility to mask-wearing
was evident. Although no lockdowns and gentle nudge to wear mask seemed
counter-intuitive, simple and persistent communication on personal safety has
been effective and sustainable to induce cooperative behavioral adaptations.
Our phase-specific analyses and interpretation highlight the importance of
targeted response consistent with the fluctuating epidemic risk.

  of Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone","Social-distancing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread
reductions in air pollutant emissions. Quantifying these changes requires a
business as usual counterfactual that accounts for the synoptic and seasonal
variability of air pollutants. We use a machine learning algorithm driven by
information from the NASA GEOS-CF model to assess changes in nitrogen dioxide
(NO$_{2}$) and ozone (O$_{3}$) at 5,756 observation sites in 46 countries from
January through June 2020. Reductions in NO$_{2}$ correlate with timing and
intensity of COVID-19 restrictions, ranging from 60% in severely affected
cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On
average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from
February 2020 onward. China experienced the earliest and steepest decline, but
concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the
business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been
more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that
the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months
of 2020 amounted to 2.9 TgN, equivalent to 5.1% of the annual anthropogenic
total. The response of surface O$_{3}$ is complicated by competing influences
of non-linear atmospheric chemistry. While surface O$_{3}$ increased by up to
50% in some locations, we find the overall net impact on daily average O$_{3}$
between February - June 2020 to be small. However, our analysis indicates a
flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone
due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a
reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on
season, time scale, and environment, with declines in surface O$_{3}$
forecasted if NO$_{x}$ emission reductions continue.

  Reviews: An Unsupervised Text Analytics Approach","To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the
passenger's perspective and tailor service offerings for competitive advantage,
airlines can capitalize on the abundantly available online customer reviews
(OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics
approach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted
using three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and
two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,
we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the
individual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most
representative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a
review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the
predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot
of passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established
by consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a
bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis
within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the
proposed approach. The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective
performance summary of an airline and its competitors can be obtained from OCR.
Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications based on our
results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the
airline industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) and predictions on similar pandemics in the future.

  Images","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the main agenda of the whole
world, since it came into sight in December 2019 as it has significantly
affected the world economy and healthcare system. Given the effects of COVID-19
on pulmonary tissues, chest radiographic imaging has become a necessity for
screening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep
Learning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these
methods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited
chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred
COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation
with the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or
limited capability in infection localization and severity grading of COVID-19
pneumonia. In this study, we address this urgent need by proposing a systematic
and unified approach for lung segmentation and COVID-19 localization with
infection quantification from CXR images. To accomplish this, we have
constructed the largest benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including
11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of ground-truth lung segmentation
masks is performed on CXRs by a novel human-machine collaborative approach. An
extensive set of experiments was performed using the state-of-the-art
segmentation networks, U-Net, U-Net++, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN). The
developed network, after an extensive iterative process, reached a superior
performance for lung region segmentation with Intersection over Union (IoU) of
96.11% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.99%. Furthermore, COVID-19
infections of various shapes and types were reliably localized with 83.05% IoU

COVID-19 detection performance with both sensitivity and specificity values

applications, including modeling of information or gossip spread in online
social networks, modeling of malware spread in communication networks, and the
most recent model of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the information disseminated is
accurate, for example, maximizing its distribution is desirable, whereas if it
is a rumor or a virus, its spread should be minimized. In this context, it is
very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize
propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained
momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of
nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality
measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this
study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of
nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model
and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes
according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the
Expected Value Estimation (EVE). We compared the performance of EVE, using
different SIR settings on real datasets, with that of many current well-known
centrality measures. The experimental studies demonstrated that the solution

months changed the time series properties of the data in ways that make many

variations around the outbreak can be interpreted as outliers, as shifts to the
distribution of existing shocks, or as addition of new shocks. I take the
latter view and use \covid\ indicators as controls to 'de-covid' the data prior
to estimation. I find that economic uncertainty remains high at the end of 2020
even though real economic activity has recovered and \covid\ uncertainty has
receded. Dynamic responses of variables to shocks in a VAR similar in magnitude
and shape to the ones identified before 2020 can be recovered by directly or
indirectly modeling \covid\ and treating it as exogenous. These responses to
economic shocks are distinctly different from those to a \covid\ shock, and
distinguishing between the two types of shocks can be important in

on the estimated ${\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.
The result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries
respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we
extend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$
of new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social
response is on the form $d_t{\cal R}=-\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold
for response. The response rate $\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or
above this threshold, on three parameters $\nu_1,\;\nu_2,\,\nu_3,$, and on $t$.
When $X<X^*$, $\nu= \nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when
the incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\nu=\nu_2\exp{(-\nu_3t)}$, models the
impact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\nu_3$
represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time
passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19
epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters
$\nu_1,\,\nu_2,\,\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\cal R}_0$, for
different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social
responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave
in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during
the summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the
fall.

  cases: A data-driven analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a public health emergency
of international concern affecting 201 countries and territories around the
globe. As of April 4, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than
11,16,643 confirmed infections and more than 59,170 reported deaths worldwide.
The main focus of this paper is two-fold: (a) generating short term (real-time)
forecasts of the future COVID-19 cases for multiple countries; (b) risk
assessment (in terms of case fatality rate) of the novel COVID-19 for some
profoundly affected countries by finding various important demographic
characteristics of the countries along with some disease characteristics. To
solve the first problem, we presented a hybrid approach based on autoregressive
integrated moving average model and Wavelet-based forecasting model that can
generate short-term (ten days ahead) forecasts of the number of daily confirmed
cases for Canada, France, India, South Korea, and the UK. The predictions of
the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective
allocation of health care resources and will act as an early-warning system for
government policymakers. In the second problem, we applied an optimal
regression tree algorithm to find essential causal variables that significantly
affect the case fatality rates for different countries. This data-driven
analysis will necessarily provide deep insights into the study of early risk
assessments for 50 immensely affected countries.

X-ray data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to diagnose

privacy. GAN will leak the semantic information of the training data which can
be used to reconstruct the training samples by attackers, thereby this method
will leak the privacy of the patient. Furthermore, for this reason that is the
limitation of the training data sample, different hospitals jointly train the

this problem, we adopt the Federated Learning (FL) frame-work which is a new

telling a longer story about the evolution of social thinking about the
normative structure of science from Merton's articulation of his well-known
norms (those of universalism, communism, organized skepticism, and
disinterestedness) to the present. I show that while Merton's norms and his
intertwinement of these with the underlying mechanisms of democratic order
provide us with an especially good starting point to explore and clarify the
commitments and values of science, Leonelli's broader, more context-responsive,
and more holistic vision of the epistemic integrity of data scientific
understanding, and her discernment of the global and biospheric scope of its
moral-practical reach, move beyond Merton's schema in ways that effectively
draw upon important critiques. Stepping past Merton, I argue that a combination
of situated universalism, methodological pluralism, strong objectivity, and
unbounded communalism must guide the responsible and sustainable data work of
the future.

  Models with Applications to Forecasting Number of Deaths during the COVID-19
  Pandemic","Motivated by the current Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which is
due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the important problem of forecasting daily
deaths and cumulative deaths, this paper examines the construction of
prediction regions or intervals under the Poisson regression model and for an
over-dispersed Poisson regression model. For the Poisson regression model,
several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared
through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of
forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to
COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened,
daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by
June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data
relative to the Poisson regression model. An over-dispersed Poisson regression
model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival
Analysis and over-dispersion is quantified through an additional parameter. The
Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson
regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion
parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number
of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is
presented. Finally, the paper discusses limitations of proposed procedures and
mentions open research problems, as well as the dangers and pitfalls when
forecasting on a long horizon, with focus on this pandemic where events, both
foreseen and unforeseen, could have huge impacts on point predictions and
prediction regions.

suffering from it. These are based on the number of excess deaths attributed
either directly or indirectly to the epidemic. Unfortunately the data on which
such comparisons rely are often incomplete and unreliable. This article
discusses problems of interpretation of data even when the data is largely
accurate and delayed by at most two to three weeks. This applies to the Office
of National Statistics in the UK, the Statistisches Bundesamt in Germany and
the Belgian statistical office Statbel. The data in the article is taken from
these three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of
deaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to
country. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years,
in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11
years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on
the timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics
and heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline
defined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors
can be operationalized by taking say the 10\% quantile of the number of deaths.
This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It
therefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries.
The article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between
countries. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics by their timing,
that is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the
height of the maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered.

arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can

the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are

  COVID-19 pandemic","By using 530 responses from an online questionnaire, this study aims to
investigate the transition from physical to online shopping alternatives during
the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic period at the individual level. The
focus areas of the study are Sweden and Italy, two European countries that
implemented contrasting prevention measures. This study analyses the impacts of
the pandemic to the shopping behaviour and identifies, among the respondents,
who have changed the behaviour the most, how respondents have adopted different
shopping strategies, what the main differences between Italian and Swedish
responses are and the influence of population density on the behavioural
change. Multivariate statistical analyses, including linear and binary logistic
regressions and multinomial logit models were used to analyse the dataset. The
results confirm the differences between Italy and Sweden in terms of social
distancing measures, social structures and technology readiness. Moreover, the
socio-demographic and household structures of the respondents were found
instrumental in influencing the amount and the direction of change in shopping
behaviour during the first wave of the pandemic period. The output of this
study highlights the impact that contrasting policies have on citizens, and
also the importance of having policies that are adaptable to different
situations.

COVID-19 epidemic spread was carried out in the world and in the countries with
the largest number of infected people such as the USA, Brasil, Russia and India
in the first half of 2020. It was shown that for the countries with strong
restrictive measures the spread of COVID-19 fit on a single wave with small
capacity as for a number of countries with violation of restrictive measures
the spread of the epidemic fit on a waves superposition. For countries with
large population mixing, the spread of the epidemic today also fits into a
single wave, but with a huge capacity value (for Brazil - 80 million people,
for India - 40 million people). We estimated that the epidemic spread in the
world today fits into 5 waves. The first two waves are caused by the epidemic
spread in China (the first - in Wuhan), the third - by the epidemic spread in
European countries, the fourth mainly by the epidemic spread in Russia and the
USA, the fifth wave is mainly caused by the epidemic spread in Latin America
and South Asia. It was the fifth wave that led to the spread of the coronavirus
epidemic COVID-19 entering a new phase, with an increase in the number of
infected more than 100 thousand inhabitants. For all the studied countries and
the world, for each of the superposition waves, the wave capacities and growth
indicators were calculated. The local peaks of the waves and their ending times

  data of China","During the study of epidemics, one of the most significant and also
challenging problems is to forecast the future trends, on which all follow-up
actions of individuals and governments heavily rely. However, to pick out a
reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of
various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat
of COVID-19 pandemics now.
  Based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported
during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast
ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference
methods and five dynamical models. We highlight the significance of a well
balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting,
as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike
information criterion, root mean square error and robustness index to evaluate
various epidemic models/methods.
  Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a
crucial role in forecasting. We further notice the Logistic function steadily
underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an
overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time
dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective
reproduction number into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in
the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential
growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the
inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast.
Towards the ODE models, the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models are shown to be suitable

time series are learned for each country via a normalized inner product.
Combining these with additional calculations, we can determine which countries

paper identifies similarities in the trajectories of cases and deaths for
European countries and U.S. states. Our analysis refines the popular conception
that the mortality rate has greatly decreased throughout Europe during its
second wave of COVID-19; instead, we demonstrate substantial heterogeneity
throughout Europe and the U.S. The Netherlands exhibited the largest reduction
of mortality, a factor of 16, followed by Denmark, France, Belgium, and other
Western European countries, greater than both Eastern European countries and
U.S. states. Some structural similarity is observed between Europe and the

splittings and different types of weak regular splittings. If monotonicity
fails, then it is difficult to guarantee the convergence of the above-mentioned
classes of matrices. In such a case, $K$-monotonicity is sufficient for the
convergence of $K$-regular and $K$-weak regular splittings, where $K$ is a
proper cone in $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, the convergence theory of a two-stage
iteration scheme in general proper cone setting is a gap in the literature.
Especially, the same study for weak regular splittings of type II (even if in
standard proper cone setting, i.e., $K=\mathbb{R}^n_+$), is open. To this end,
we propose convergence theory of two-stage iterative scheme for $K$-weak
regular splittings of both types in the proper cone setting. We provide some
sufficient conditions which guarantee that the induced splitting from a
two-stage iterative scheme is a $K$-regular splitting and then establish some
comparison theorems. We also study $K$-monotone convergence theory of the

warning system that predicts the locations of outbreaks is of crucial
importance. Studies have shown the effectiveness of using large-scale mobility
data to monitor the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,
lockdowns) through population density analysis. However, predicting the
locations of potential outbreak occurrence is difficult using mobility data
alone. Meanwhile, web search queries have been shown to be good predictors of
the disease spread. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset of human
mobility trajectories (GPS traces) and web search queries with common user
identifiers (> 450K users), to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations beforehand.
More specifically, web search query analysis is conducted to identify users
with high risk of COVID-19 contraction, and social contact analysis was further
performed on the mobility patterns of these users to quantify the risk of an
outbreak. Our approach is empirically tested using data collected from users in

emergency of international concern. During the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,
people have been advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to

droplets trapped inside a turbulent puff cloud can travel up to 7 to 8 m. We
propose a nuclear physics analogy-based modeling of the complex gas cloud and
its payload of pathogen-virions. We show that the cloud stopping range is
proportional to the product of the puff's diameter and its density. We use our
puff model to determine the average density of the buoyant fluid in the
turbulent cloud. A fit to the experimental data yields $1.8 < \rho_P/\rho_{\rm

puff and the air. We demonstrate that temperature variation could cause an
${\cal O}(\pm 8\%)$ effect in the puff stopping range for extreme ambient cold
or warmth. We also demonstrate that aerosols and droplets can remain suspended
for hours in the air. Therefore, once the puff slows down sufficiently, and its
coherence is lost, the eventual spreading of the infected aerosols becomes

  establishment, initial growth rate, and infection cluster size at first
  detection","Emerging epidemics and local infection clusters are initially prone to
stochastic effects that can substantially impact the epidemic trajectory. While
numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established
epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are
comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results, and derive
new results to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by
a single infected individual. We cover the probability of establishment of an
epidemic as a function of the distribution of secondary infections, the
expectation of epidemic size as a function of time, and the convergence to a
deterministic exponential regime. Stochasticity systematically accelerates the
initial growth of an epidemic, because epidemics that do not get extinct have
faster initial growth on average. This also affects the long-term epidemic
growth by increasing the cumulative size by a constant factor. Applying these
results, we compute the probability distribution of the first detection time of
an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on the testing effort
(assumed to be constant in time), and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of
concern B.1.1.7, detected in September 2020, first appeared in the United
Kingdom early August 2020. We estimate a minimal testing frequency to detect
clusters before they exceed a certain threshold size, and we compute the
detection rate of infected individuals during a single mass testing effort. For

  States by a generalized fractional-order SEIR model","In this paper, a generalized fractional-order SEIR model is proposed, denoted
by SEIQRP model, which has a basic guiding significance for the prediction of
the possible outbreak of infectious diseases like COVID-19 and other insect
diseases in the future. Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are
analyzed. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is derived. When $R_{0}<1$, the
disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable.
When $R_{0}>1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some
conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of
disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in
the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual
behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is
proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United
States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for
the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the
United States in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated
cases are predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the
development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for
understanding the trend of the outbreak.

  A Review","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly
discovered coronavirus. The disease presents with symptoms such as shortness of
breath, fever, dry cough, and chronic fatigue, amongst others. Sometimes the
symptoms of the disease increase so much they lead to the death of the
patients. The disease may be asymptomatic in some patients in the early stages,
which can lead to increased transmission of the disease to others. Many studies
have tried to use medical imaging for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This study
attempts to review papers on automatic methods for medical image analysis and
diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv and
medRxiv were searched to find related studies by the end of April 2020, and the
essential points of the collected studies were summarised. The contribution of
this study is four-fold: 1) to use as a tutorial of the field for both
clinicians and technologists, 2) to comprehensively review the characteristics
of COVID-19 as presented in medical images, 3) to examine automated artificial
intelligence-based approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis based on the accuracy and
the method used, 4) to express the research limitations in this field and the
methods used to overcome them. COVID-19 reveals signs in medical images can be
used for early diagnosis of the disease even in asymptomatic patients. Using
automated machine learning-based methods can diagnose the disease with high
accuracy from medical images and reduce time, cost and error of diagnostic
procedure. It is recommended to collect bulk imaging data from patients in the
shortest possible time to improve the performance of COVID-19 automated
diagnostic methods.

difference in the infection rate observed in each region, in addition to
studies seeking the cause due to differences in the social distance (population
density), there is an increasing trend toward studies seeking the cause due to
differences in social capital. However, studies have not yet been conducted on
whether social capital could influence the infection rate even if it controls
the effect of population density. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the
relationship between infection rate, population density, and social capital
using statistical data for each prefecture. Statistical analysis showed that
social capital not only correlates with infection rates and population
densities but still has a negative correlation with infection rates controlling
for the effects of population density. Besides, controlling the relationship
between variables by mean age showed that social capital had a greater
correlation with infection rate than population density. In other words, social
capital mediates the correlation between population density and infection
rates. This means that social distance alone is not enough to deter coronavirus
infection, and social capital needs to be recharged.

of demographic information and ground truth labels. More precisely, we show
that linking voter roll data -- containing individual-level voter turnout for
specific voting locations along with race and age -- can facilitate the
construction of rigorous bias and reliability tests. These tests illuminate a
sampling bias that is particularly noteworthy in the pandemic context: older
and non-white voters are less likely to be captured by mobility data. We show
that allocating public health resources based on such mobility data could
disproportionately harm high-risk elderly and minority groups.

domain, RBD) to its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the
antibodies is of great importance in understanding the infectivity of COVID-19
and evaluating the candidate therapeutic for COVID-19. In this work, we propose
a new method based on molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area
(MM/PBSA) to accurately calculate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to
ACE2 and antibodies. The calculated binding free energy of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to
ACE2 is -13.3 kcal/mol, and that of SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2 is -11.4 kcal/mol,
which agrees well with experimental result (-11.3 kcal/mol and -10.1 kcal/mol,
respectively). Moreover, we take two recently reported antibodies as the
example, and calculate the free energy of antibodies binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD,
which is also consistent with the experimental findings. Further, within the
framework of the modified MM/PBSA, we determine the key residues and the main
driving forces for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/CB6 interaction by the computational
alanine scanning method. The present study offers a computationally efficient
and numerically reliable method to evaluate the free energy of SARS-CoV-2

  Constraint","Deep neural networks have increasingly been used as an auxiliary tool in
healthcare applications, due to their ability to improve performance of several
diagnosis tasks. However, these methods are not widely adopted in clinical
settings due to the practical limitations in the reliability, generalizability,
and interpretability of deep learning based systems. As a result, methods have
been developed that impose additional constraints during network training to
gain more control as well as improve interpretabilty, facilitating their
acceptance in healthcare community. In this work, we investigate the benefit of
using Orthogonal Spheres (OS) constraint for classification of COVID-19 cases
from chest X-ray images. The OS constraint can be written as a simple
orthonormality term which is used in conjunction with the standard
cross-entropy loss during classification network training. Previous studies
have demonstrated significant benefits in applying such constraints to deep
learning models. Our findings corroborate these observations, indicating that
the orthonormality loss function effectively produces improved semantic
localization via GradCAM visualizations, enhanced classification performance,
and reduced model calibration error. Our approach achieves an improvement in
accuracy of 1.6% and 4.8% for two- and three-class classification,
respectively; similar results are found for models with data augmentation

  intervention under ICU sustainability","We consider here an extended SIR model, including several features of the
recent COVID-19 outbreak: in particular the infected and recovered individuals
can either be detected (+) or undetected (-) and we also integrate an intensive
care unit (ICU) capacity. Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis
of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both
lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based
on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various
quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off
between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with
the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as
an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong
lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a
short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to
normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal
scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is
released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures
with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on
detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are
introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing
can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals
to be more moderate.

reported at the end of 2019. As a consequence of its highly infectious nature,
countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control
its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have
done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop
medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a
great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters
in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict
the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course
of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the
determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the
infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic
wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily
fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020
are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each
country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error
are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean
duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the
spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case).
Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the
inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly
estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by
comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were
realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were
retained.

severe physical afflictions through their use in assistive systems. Common
methods of achieving this is via Motor Imagery (MI), which maps brain signals
to code for certain commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is preferred for
recording brain signal data on account of it being non-invasive. Despite their
potential utility, MI-BCI systems are yet confined to research labs. A major
cause for this is lack of robustness of such systems. As hypothesized by two
teams during Cybathlon 2016, a particular source of the system's vulnerability
is the sharp change in the subject's state of emotional arousal. This work aims
towards making MI-BCI systems resilient to such emotional perturbations. To do
so, subjects are exposed to high and low arousal-inducing virtual reality (VR)
environments before recording EEG data. The advent of COVID-19 compelled us to
modify our methodology. Instead of training machine learning algorithms to
classify emotional arousal, we opt for classifying subjects that serve as proxy
for each state. Additionally, MI models are trained for each subject instead of
each arousal state. As training subjects to use MI-BCI can be an arduous and
time-consuming process, reducing this variability and increasing robustness can
considerably accelerate the acceptance and adoption of assistive technologies

Coronavirus (COVID-19), together with Lung Cancer are significantly widespread
and are, typically, considered life threatening. In particular, lung cancer is
among the most common and deadliest cancers with a low 5-year survival rate.
Timely diagnosis of lung cancer is, therefore, of paramount importance as it
can save countless lives. In this regard, deep learning radiomics solutions
have the promise of extracting the most useful features on their own in an
end-to-end fashion without having access to the annotated boundaries. Among
different deep learning models, Capsule Networks are proposed to overcome
shortcomings of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) such as their inability
to recognize detailed spatial relations. Capsule networks have so far shown
satisfying performance in medical imaging problems. Capitalizing on their
success, in this study, we propose a novel capsule network-based mixture of
experts, referred to as the MIXCAPS. The proposed MIXCAPS architecture takes
advantage of not only the capsule network's capabilities to handle small
datasets, but also automatically splitting dataset through a convolutional
gating network. MIXCAPS enables capsule network experts to specialize on
different subsets of the data. Our results show that MIXCAPS outperforms a
single capsule network and a mixture of CNNs, with an accuracy of 92.88%,
sensitivity of 93.2%, specificity of 92.3% and area under the curve of 0.963.
Our experiments also show that there is a relation between the gate outputs and
a couple of hand-crafted features, illustrating explainable nature of the
proposed MIXCAPS. To further evaluate generalization capabilities of the
proposed MIXCAPS architecture, additional experiments on a brain tumor dataset
are performed showing potentials of MIXCAPS for detection of tumors related to
other organs.

introduced in countries worldwide to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Many
governments have begun to implement lockdown exit strategies that allow
restrictions to be relaxed while attempting to control the risk of a surge in
cases. Mathematical modelling has played a central role in guiding
interventions, but the challenge of designing optimal exit strategies in the
face of ongoing transmission is unprecedented. Here, we report discussions from
the Isaac Newton Institute 'Models for an exit strategy' workshop (11-15 May
2020). A diverse community of modellers who are providing evidence to
governments worldwide were asked to identify the main questions that, if
answered, will allow for more accurate predictions of the effects of different
exit strategies. Based on these questions, we propose a roadmap to facilitate
the development of reliable models to guide exit strategies. The roadmap
requires a global collaborative effort from the scientific community and
policy-makers, and is made up of three parts: i) improve estimation of key
epidemiological parameters; ii) understand sources of heterogeneity in
populations; iii) focus on requirements for data collection, particularly in
Low-to-Middle-Income countries. This will provide important information for
planning exit strategies that balance socio-economic benefits with public
health.

jointly modeling extreme spikes in weekly new cases, our results show that the

  one-shot non-pharmaceutical intervention in a hybrid epidemic model","Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19,
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates
without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate
spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different
NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each
country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of
policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to
further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well
as numerical simulations. In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR
model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that
the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite
time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It
was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and
the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The
analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the
peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. This study provides
quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and
the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests
the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are
necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments

positive/negative within the first round of tests. Precisely, if the tested
group has exactly one positive sample then the protocols identify it without
further individual tests. The protocols also detect the presence of two or more
positives in the group, in which case a second round could be applied to
identify the positive individuals. With a prevalence of $5\%$ and maximum

globe. Large scale and rapid testing of the population is required to contain
the disease, but such testing is prohibitive in terms of resources, cost and
time. Recently RT-PCR based pooled testing has emerged as a promising way to
boost testing efficiency. We introduce a stepped pooled testing strategy, a
probability driven approach which significantly reduces the number of tests
required to identify infected individuals in a large population. Our
comprehensive methodology incorporates the effect of false negative and
positive rates to accurately determine not only the efficiency of pooling but
also it's accuracy. Under various plausible scenarios, we show that this
approach significantly reduces the cost of testing and also reduces the
effective false positive rate of tests when compared to a strategy of testing
every individual of a population. We also outline an optimization strategy to
obtain the pool size that maximizes the efficiency of pooling given the
diagnostic protocol parameters and local infection conditions.

  Continuous Time Picture","Typically, mathematical simulation studies on COVID-19 pandemic forecasting
are based on deterministic differential equations which assume that both the
number ($n$) of individuals in various epidemiological classes and the time
($t$) on which they depend are quantities that vary continuous. This picture
contrasts with the discrete representation of $n$ and $t$ underlying the real
epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for
which a description based on finite difference equations would be more
adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a
quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time
description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the
epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position
$T_{1/2}^{c}$ obtained within the continuous time representation is
systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position
$T_{1/2}^{d}$ predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather
counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift $\tau \equiv
T_{1/2}^{c} - T_{1/2}^{d} < 0$ is basically insensitive to changes in infection
rate $\kappa$. For a broad range of $\kappa$ values deduced from COVID-19 data
at extreme situations (exponential growth in time and complete lockdown), we
found a rather robust estimate $\tau \simeq -2.65\,\mbox{day}^{-1}$. Being
obtained without any particular assumption, the present mathematical results
apply to logistic growth in general without any limitation to a specific real
system.

  Locations to Identify Susceptible Infections in Simulated Epidemics","Amidst an increasing number of infected cases during the Covid-19 pandemic,
it is essential to trace, as early as possible, the susceptible people who
might have been infected by the disease due to their close proximity with
people who were tested positive for the virus. This early contact tracing is
likely to limit the rate of spread of the infection within a locality. In this
paper, we investigate how effectively and efficiently can such a list of
susceptible people be found given a list of infected persons and their
locations. To address this problem from an information retrieval (search)
perspective, we represent the location of each person at each time instant as a
point in a vector space. By using the locations of the given list of infected
persons as queries, we investigate the feasibility of applying approximate
nearest neighbour (ANN) based indexing and retrieval approaches to obtain a
list of top-k suspected users in real-time. Since leveraging information from
true user location data can lead to security and privacy concerns, we also
investigate what effects does distance-preserving encoding methods have on the
effectiveness of the ANN methods. Experiments conducted on real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that the top-k retrieved lists of susceptible users
retrieved with existing ANN approaches (KD-tree and HNSW) yield satisfactory
precision and recall values, thus indicating that ANN approaches can
potentially be applied in practice to facilitate real-time contact tracing even
under the presence of imposed privacy constraints.

  Tracing","Due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19, many governments suspended outdoor
activities and imposed social distancing policies to prevent the transmission
of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had severe impact on the economy and
peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective
contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models
suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact
tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital
contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple
Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to
supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn
scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt
to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many
digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit
the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this
paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks,
specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving
digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers
to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we
showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks
on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our example DoS attacks
showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within
normal working hours and days.

access and smartphone ownership are a given, people are willing and able to
install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential
exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this
work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough
smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight
a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the
elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially
distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest
risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are

about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and
corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios

characterize the durability of vaccine induced protection. If efficacy is

complicating the assessment of long term durability. We show how to analyze
durability following placebo crossover and demonstrate that the vaccine
efficacy profile that would be observed in a placebo controlled trial is
recoverable in a trial with placebo crossover. This result holds no matter when
the crossover occurs and with no assumptions about the form of the efficacy
profile. We only require that the vaccine efficacy profile applies to the newly
vaccinated irrespective of the timing of vaccination. We develop different

  antibody therapies","Antibody therapeutics and vaccines are among our last resort to end the
raging COVID-19 pandemic. They, however, are prone to over 5,000 mutations on
the spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation Tracker based on over 200,000
genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations would impact
vaccines and antibodies in the development. In this work, we study the
mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein. Additionally, we
use 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics.
Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for
the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics,
biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of 462
mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of S
protein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody
therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 vaccine escape mutants is identified,
while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that
about 65\% existing RBD mutations, including those variants recently found in
the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, are binding-strengthen mutations,
resulting in more infectious COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparity
between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFE strengthening and
weakening of the bindings with antibodies and ACE2, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2
is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the human
immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery implies
the vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Our
predictions were validated by comparison with more than 1,400 deep mutations on
the S protein RBD. Our results show the urgent need to develop new
mutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies and to prepare for seasonal
vaccinations.

coronavirus"" or COVID-19 cases, and due to the emergence of high false
negatives in the commonly used PCR tests, the necessity for probing an
alternative simple screening mechanism of COVID-19 using radiological images
(like chest X-Rays) assumes importance. In this scenario, machine learning (ML)
and deep learning (DL) offer fast, automated, effective strategies to detect
abnormalities and extract key features of the altered lung parenchyma, which
may be related to specific signatures of the COVID-19 virus. However, the
available COVID-19 datasets are inadequate to train deep neural networks.
Therefore, we propose a new concept called domain extension transfer learning
(DETL). We employ DETL, with pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, on
a related large chest X-Ray dataset that is tuned for classifying between four
classes \textit{viz.} $normal$, $pneumonia$, $other\_disease$, and $Covid-19$.
A 5-fold cross validation is performed to estimate the feasibility of using
chest X-Rays to diagnose COVID-19. The initial results show promise, with the
possibility of replication on bigger and more diverse data sets. The overall
accuracy was measured as $90.13\% \pm 0.14$. In order to get an idea about the
COVID-19 detection transparency, we employed the concept of Gradient Class
Activation Map (Grad-CAM) for detecting the regions where the model paid more
attention during the classification. This was found to strongly correlate with
clinical findings, as validated by experts.

Substitutional Reality (SR) installation that combines visual and tactile
stimuli. The installation is set up in a center for architecture, and invites
visitors to explore its facade while playing with vertigo, in a visual Virtual

installation. Drawing on an ethnographic approach, including observations and
interviews, we researched the exhibit from its opening, through the initial
months plagued by technical problems, its subsequent success as a social and
playful installation, on to its closure, due to COVID-19, and its subsequent
reopening. Our findings explore the challenges caused by both the hybrid nature
of the installation, as well as the visitor' playful use of the installation

expectations of stakeholders with the audience's playful appropriation, which
led the stakeholders to see the installation as both a success and a failure.
Evaluating the design and redesign through use on behalf of visitors, we argue
that an approach that further opens up the post-production experience to a
process of continuous redesign based on the user input - what has been termed
""design-after-design"" - could facilitate the design of similar experiences in
the museum and heritage sector, supporting a participatory agenda in the design

literature establishes that communities with poverty-related health problems,

susceptible to mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, controversial
public health policies implemented by the nation's political leaders have
highlighted the socioeconomic inequalities of minorities. Therefore, through
multivariate correlational analysis using machine learning techniques and
structural equations, we measure whether social determinants are associated
with increased infection and death from COVID-19 disease. The PLS least squares
regression analysis allowed identifying a significant impact between social
determinants and COVID-19 disease through a predictive value of R2 = .916,

comprising three groups: C1 Republicans, C2 and C3 Democrats from California,
New York, Texas, and Florida. This analysis made it possible to identify the
poverty variable as the main risk factor related to the high rates of infection
in Republican states and a high positive correlation between the population not
insured with a medical plan and high levels of virus contagion in the states of

pandemic such as the COVID-19. In order to achieve efficient and scalable
contact-tracing in real time, digital devices can play an important role. While
a lot of attention has been paid to analyzing the privacy and ethical risks of
the associated mobile applications, so far much less research has been devoted
to optimizing their performance and assessing their impact on the mitigation of
the epidemic. We develop Bayesian inference methods to estimate the risk that
an individual is infected. This inference is based on the list of his recent
contacts and their own risk levels, as well as personal information such as
results of tests or presence of syndromes. We propose to use probabilistic risk
estimation in order to optimize testing and quarantining strategies for the
control of an epidemic. Our results show that in some range of epidemic
spreading (typically when the manual tracing of all contacts of infected people
becomes practically impossible, but before the fraction of infected people
reaches the scale where a lock-down becomes unavoidable), this inference of
individuals at risk could be an efficient way to mitigate the epidemic. Our
approaches translate into fully distributed algorithms that only require
communication between individuals who have recently been in contact. Such
communication may be encrypted and anonymized and thus compatible with privacy
preserving standards. We conclude that probabilistic risk estimation is capable
to enhance performance of digital contact tracing and should be considered in
the currently developed mobile applications.

  devices Using Physical Layer Security","Secure and scalable device provisioning is a notorious challenge in Wi-Fi.
WPA2/WPA3 solutions take user interaction and a strong passphrase for granted.
However, the often weak passphrases are subject to guessing attacks. Notably,
there has been a significant rise of cyberattacks on Wi-Fi home or small office
networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper addresses the device
provisioning problem in Wi-Fi (personal mode) and proposes ComPass protocol to
supplement WPA2/WPA3. ComPass replaces the pre-installed or user-selected
passphrases with automatically generated ones. For this, ComPass employs
Physical Layer Security and extracts credentials from common random physical
layer parameters between devices. Two major features make ComPass unique and
superior compared to previous proposals: First, it employs phase information
(rather than amplitude or signal strength) to generate the passphrase so that
it is robust, scaleable, and impossible to guess. Our analysis showed that
ComPass generated passphrases have 3 times more entropy than human generated
passphrases (113-bits vs. 34-bits). Second, ComPass selects parameters such
that two devices bind only within a certain proximity (less than 3m), hence
providing practically useful in-build PLS-based authentiation. ComPass is
available as a kernel module or as full firmware.

stock of equipments at a unit that is not needed (in near future) could be
shared to other units; and (2) extra stock to be shared among the units in a
region can be efficiently distributed taking into account the demand of the
units. The decisions are taken with the aim of minimizing certain measures of
the non-covered demand in a region where a given network structured set of
units is given. The mathematical programming models that we provide are
stochastic and multiperiod and we provide different robust objective functions.

Transcriptional changes due to epigenetic regulation are key host cell

account for control measures such as vaccination or quarantine. However,
COVID-19 has brought unprecedented social distancing measures, with a challenge
on how to include these in a manner that can explain the data but avoid

model, where social distancing effects are introduced analogous to
coarse-grained models of gene expression control in systems biology. We apply
our approach to understand drastic differences in COVID-19 infection and
fatality counts, observed between Hubei (Wuhan) and other Mainland China
provinces. We find that these unintuitive data may be explained through an
interplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, and
detection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces. More generally, our
results demonstrate that regional differences may drastically shape infection
outbursts. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of our developed
method to extract key infection parameters directly from publically available
data so that it can be globally applied to outbreaks of COVID-19 in a number of

  the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by
various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2
causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social
distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this
end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized
(C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and
analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous
complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is
necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is
insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with
the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy
at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees
to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that
stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the
outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for
the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus
reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find
that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the
adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a
region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an
understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our
investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into
understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak
infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to
understand and control over an extended period of time.

Specifically, we examine differences in moral framing in two datasets: (i)

more extensive dictionary and adapt it to German-language tweets. Overall, in
both datasets, we observe a moral framing that is congruent with the public
perception of the political parties. In the US dataset, democrats have a
tendency to frame tweets in terms of care, while loyalty is a characteristic
frame for republicans. In the Austrian dataset, we find that the followers of
the governing conservative party emphasize care, which is a key message and
moral frame in the party's COVID-19 campaign slogan. Our work complements

Data: a real-time source of consumption data that is a highly correlated,
leading indicator of Bank of England and Office for National Statistics data.
The UK's recovery is heavily weighted towards the ""home counties"" around outer
London and the South. We observe a stark contrast between strong online
spending growth while offline spending contracts. The strongest recovery in
spending is seen in online spending in the ""commuter belt"" areas in outer
London and the surrounding localities and also in areas of high second home
ownership, where working from home (including working from second homes) has
significantly displaced the location of spending. Year-on-year spending growth
in November 2020 in localities facing the UK's new tighter ""Tier 3""
restrictions (mostly the midlands and northern areas) was 38.4% lower compared
with areas facing the less restrictive ""Tier 2"" (mostly London and the South).
These patterns had been further exacerbated during November 2020 when a second

inequalities from becoming persistent we propose governments introduce

  Demographic Information","Pulmonary diseases impact millions of lives globally and annually. The recent
outbreak of the pandemic of the COVID-19, a novel pulmonary infection, has more
than ever brought the attention of the research community to the machine-aided
diagnosis of respiratory problems. This paper is thus an effort to exploit
machine learning for classification of respiratory problems and proposes a
framework that employs as much correlated information (auditory and demographic
information in this work) as a dataset provides to increase the sensitivity and
specificity of a diagnosing system. First, we use deep convolutional neural
networks (DCNNs) to process and classify a publicly released pulmonary auditory
dataset, and then we take advantage of the existing demographic information
within the dataset and show that the accuracy of the pulmonary classification
increases by 5% when trained on the auditory information in conjunction with
the demographic information. Since the demographic data can be extracted using
computer vision, we suggest using another parallel DCNN to estimate the
demographic information of the subject under test visioned by the processing
computer. Lastly, as a proposition to bring the healthcare system to users'
fingertips, we measure deployment characteristics of the auditory DCNN model
onto processing components of an NVIDIA TX2 development board.

  Adoption Intention","Smartphone-based contact-tracing apps are a promising solution to help scale
up the conventional contact-tracing process. However, low adoption rates have
become a major issue that prevents these apps from achieving their full
potential. In this paper, we present a national-scale survey experiment ($N =
1963$) in the U.S. to investigate the effects of app design choices and
individual differences on COVID-19 contact-tracing app adoption intentions. We
found that individual differences such as prosocialness, COVID-19 risk
perceptions, general privacy concerns, technology readiness, and demographic
factors played a more important role than app design choices such as
decentralized design vs. centralized design, location use, app providers, and
the presentation of security risks. Certain app designs could exacerbate the
different preferences in different sub-populations which may lead to an
inequality of acceptance to certain app design choices (e.g., developed by
state health authorities vs. a large tech company) among different groups of
people (e.g., people living in rural areas vs. people living in urban areas).
Our mediation analysis showed that one's perception of the public health
benefits offered by the app and the adoption willingness of other people had a
larger effect in explaining the observed effects of app design choices and
individual differences than one's perception of the app's security and privacy
risks. With these findings, we discuss practical implications on the design,
marketing, and deployment of COVID-19 contact-tracing apps in the U.S.

material foundation of spider silk, cells, and hair, but also offering other
functions from enzymes to drugs, and pathogens like viruses. Based on a
nanomechanical analysis of the structure and motions of atoms and molecules at
multiple scales, we report sonified versions of the coronavirus spike protein
of the pathogen of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. The audio signal, created using a novel
nanomechanical sonification method, features an overlay of the vibrational
signatures of the protein's primary, secondary and higher-order structures.
Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and
one based on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing
protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent,
analyze and design architectural features across length- and time-scales. We
further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct
protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the
binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly
influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development
of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through
melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other
applications of audible coding of matter include material design by
manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to
broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a
physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as

low-latency queries from multiple platforms. Response to challenges like

explainable results, higher precision and recall, and less overfitting. Our
learnings can be applied to other narrow-topic classifiers.

  We propose ACDC-Tracing, a simpler, anonymous, voucher-based contact tracing

who test positive are given an anonymous voucher which they can share with a
limited number of people whom they think they might be infected. The recipients
can use this voucher to book a COVID-19 test and can receive their test results
without ever revealing their identity. People receiving positive result are
given vouchers to further backtrack the path of infection.
  This is a fully anonymous solution which does not require any sharing of
location data, Bluetooth, or having an app installed on people's mobile device.
Moreover, ACDC-Tracing can be tested for effectiveness at a small scale without
requiring adoption by the entire population, which would enable acquiring fast
evidence about its efficacy and scalability. Finally, it is compatible with and
complementary to alternative approaches to contact tracing.

actions are grandly slowed down by the shortage of testing kits. Governments
have taken several measures to work around this shortage: the FDA has become
more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency
measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to
100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program.
However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are
still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists
in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples
once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost.
However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which
patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected
patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify
them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy.
Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine
learning or clinical examinations. The resulting algorithms, which can be
interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and
quite surprising. They are patent-free. Co-authors are listed in alphabetical

already presented efficacy and security, which qualify them to be used in mass
vaccination campaigns. Thus, setting up strategies of vaccination became
crucial to control the COVID19 pandemic. Methods: We use daily COVID-19 reports
from Chicago and NYC from 01-Mar2020 to 28- Nov-2020 to estimate the parameters
of an SEIR-like epidemiological model that accounts for different severity
levels. To achieve data adherent predictions, we let the model parameters to be
time-dependent. The model is used to forecast different vaccination scenarios,
where the campaign starts at different dates, from 01-Oct-2020 to 01-Apr-2021.
To generate realistic scenarios, disease control strategies are implemented
whenever the number of predicted daily hospitalizations reaches a preset
threshold. Results: The model reproduces the empirical data with remarkable
accuracy. Delaying the vaccination severely affects the mortality,
hospitalization, and recovery projections. In Chicago, the disease spread was
under control, reducing the mortality increment as the start of the vaccination
was postponed. In NYC, the number of cases was increasing, thus, the estimated
model predicted a much larger impact, despite the implementation of contention
measures. The earlier the vaccination campaign begins, the larger is its
potential impact in reducing the COVID-19 cases, as well as in the
hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, the rate at which cases,
hospitalizations and deaths increase with the delay in the vaccination
beginning strongly depends on the shape of the incidence of infection in each
city.

they cause infectious diseases which can lead to epidemics. Recent coronavirus
disease 2019 epidemic has shown that taking effective prevention measures such
as wearing masks are important to reduce the human deaths and side effects of
the epidemic. It is therefore requisite to accurately model the spread of
infectious diseases whose one of the most crucial routes of transmission is
airborne transmission. The transmission models in the literature are proposed
independently from each other, at different scales and by the researchers from
various disciplines. Thus, there is a need to merge all these research
attempts. To this end, we propose a communication engineering approach that
melts different disciplines such as epidemiology, biology, medicine, and fluid
dynamics in the same pot to model airborne pathogen transmission among humans.
In this approach, we introduce the concept of mobile human ad hoc networks
(MoHANETs). This concept exploits the similarity of airborne
transmission-driven human groups with mobile ad hoc networks and uses molecular
communication as the enabling paradigm. The aim of this article is to present a
unified framework using communication engineering, and to highlight future
research directions for modeling the spread of infectious diseases among humans
through airborne pathogen transmission. In this article, we first review the
airborne pathogen transmission mechanisms. Then, the MoHANET is given with a
layered structure. In these layers, the infectious human emitting
pathogen-laden droplets through air and the exposed human to these droplets are
considered as the transmitter and receiver, respectively. Moreover, the

advanced artificial intelligence can occur safely and beneficially. But how can
we guarantee this safe interaction? Are there any indications that a
Singularity may be on the horizon? In trying to answer these questions, We'll
make a small introduction to the area of security research in artificial
intelligence. We'll review some of the current paradigms in the development of
autonomous intelligent systems and evidence that we can use to prospect the
coming of a possible technological Singularity. Finally, we will present a
reflection using the COVID-19 pandemic, something that showed that our biggest
problem in managing existential risks is our lack of coordination skills as a

the temporal perspective, we find that the change of mobility patterns does not
necessarily correlate with government policies and guidelines, but is more
related to people's awareness of the pandemic, which is reflected by the search
data from Google Trends. Our results show that it takes on average 14 days for
the mobility patterns to adjust to the new situation. From the spatial
perspective, we conduct a state-level network analysis and clustering using the
mobility data from Multiscale Dynamic Human Mobility Flow Dataset. As a result,
we find that 1) states in the same cluster have shorter geographical distances;
2) a 14-day delay again is found between the time when the largest number of
clusters appears and the peak of Coronavirus-related search queries on Google

measures taken by governments on the course of the epidemic. Here we show that
there is already a sufficient amount of data collected in Italy to predict the
outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the data from
Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate
the expected number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of

by day, which can help to make further public decisions. The method is based on
the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the

  Quantitative Features from Chest CT Images","Background: Chest computed tomography (CT) is recognized as an important tool
for COVID-19 severity assessment. As the number of affected patients increase
rapidly, manual severity assessment becomes a labor-intensive task, and may
lead to delayed treatment. Purpose: Using machine learning method to realize
automatic severity assessment (non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 based on chest
CT images, and to explore the severity-related features from the resulting
assessment model. Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age
45.3$\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,
from which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the
whole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are
calculated. A random forest (RF) model is trained to assess the severity
(non-severe or severe) based on quantitative features. Importance of each
quantitative feature, which reflects the correlation to the severity of
COVID-19, is calculated from the RF model. Results: Using three-fold cross
validation, the RF model shows promising results, i.e., 0.933 of true positive
rate, 0.745 of true negative rate, 0.875 of accuracy, and 0.91 of area under
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The resulting importance of
quantitative features shows that the volume and its ratio (with respect to the
whole lung volume) of ground glass opacity (GGO) regions are highly related to
the severity of COVID-19, and the quantitative features calculated from the
right lung are more related to the severity assessment than those of the left
lung. Conclusion: The RF based model can achieve automatic severity assessment
(non-severe or severe) of COVID-19 infection, and the performance is promising.
Several quantitative features, which have the potential to reflect the severity
of COVID-19, were revealed.

activities including the way people communicate, move, provision themselves, or
organize leisure activities. Using mobile phone data from 1.2 million devices
in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of the COVID-19
crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity,
mobility, and circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns
with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that
Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on
public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific
responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down
gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively,
while sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms tend to synchronize. In
particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the
lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tend to
restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to
avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the
lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts
return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent
population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on
behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is
reduced by one hour. We discuss the findings in the light of gender-specific
coping strategies in response to stress and crisis.

billion 1-grams, we first compare each day's 1-gram and 2-gram usage

for Trump stories for 2016 through 2020. We measure Trump's narrative control,
the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We
then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy -- the rate at which
a population's stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that
2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation
slowed dramatically during the first two major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic,
with rapid turnover returning first with the Black Lives Matter protests
following George Floyd's murder and then later by events leading up to and

dictionary patterns. We first learn such patterns by minibatch learning from
the entire time-series and then further adapt them to the time-series by online
NMF. As we progressively adapt and improve the learned dictionary patterns to
the more recent observations, we also use them to make one-step predictions by
the partial fitting. Lastly, by recursively applying the one-step predictions,
we can extrapolate our predictions into the near future. Our prediction results

have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in 1.3 million deaths. The disease
has been spreading very rapidly and few months after the identification of the
first infected, shortage of hospital resources quickly became a problem. In
this work we investigate whether chest X-ray (CXR) can be used as a possible
tool for the early identification of patients at risk of severe outcome, like
intensive care or death. CXR is a radiological technique that compared to
computed tomography (CT) it is simpler, faster, more widespread and it induces
lower radiation dose. We present a dataset including data collected from 820
patients by six Italian hospitals in spring 2020 during the first COVID-19
emergency. The dataset includes CXR images, several clinical attributes and
clinical outcomes. We investigate the potential of artificial intelligence to
predict the prognosis of such patients, distinguishing between severe and mild
cases, thus offering a baseline reference for other researchers and
practitioners. To this goal, we present three approaches that use features
extracted from CXR images, either handcrafted or automatically by convolutional
neuronal networks, which are then integrated with the clinical data. Exhaustive
evaluation shows promising performance both in 10-fold and leave-one-centre-out
cross-validation, implying that clinical data and images have the potential to
provide useful information for the management of patients and hospital
resources.

to examine, among college students, the relationship between deteriorating
mental health conditions and changes in user behaviors when engaging with
Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of 49
students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic)

followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the
anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google
Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From
individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals
that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then
assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental
health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included
late-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the
internet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions,
social activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies are required,
our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to
establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that

quickly and reliably prioritize clinically approved compounds for their
potential effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the past decade, network
medicine has developed and validated multiple predictive algorithms for drug
repurposing, exploiting the sub-cellular network-based relationship between a
drug's targets and disease genes. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on
artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each
of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To
test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs that had been
experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, and the list of drugs under clinical
trial, that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential
COVID-19 efficacy. We find that while most algorithms offer predictive power
for these ground truth data, no single method offers consistently reliable
outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This prompted us to develop a
multimodal approach that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, showing that
a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the
performance of the best individual pipelines. We find that 76 of the 77 drugs
that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by
SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these drugs rely on network-based actions that
cannot be identified using docking-based strategies. These advances offer a

control an epidemic. It enables to isolate the detected infected individuals,
thereby limiting the disease transmission to the susceptible population.
However, despite the significance of testing policies, the recent literature on
the subject lacks a control-theoretic perspective. In this work, an epidemic
model that incorporates the testing rate as a control input is presented. The
proposed model differentiates the undetected infected from the detected
infected cases, who are assumed to be removed from the disease spreading
process in the population. First, the model is estimated and validated for
COVID-19 data in France. Then, two testing policies are proposed, the so-called
best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for
testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a lower
bound on the testing rate such that the epidemic switches from a spreading to a
non-spreading state. The COST policy is a mitigation strategy that provides an
optimal value of testing rate that minimizes the peak value of the infected
population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies
are evaluated by predicting the number of active intensive care unit (ICU)
cases and the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19.

tested based solely on a predefined risk of being infectious implies the
absolute case numbers reflect the prevalence, but turned out to be a poor
predictor, consistently overestimating growth rates at the beginning of two
COVID-19 epidemic waves. In contrast, assuming that testing capacity is fully

allowing continued, albeit reduced, economic activity. Periodicity confers (i)
predictability, which is essential for economic sustainability, and (ii)
robustness, since lockdown periods are not activated by uncertain measurements
over short time scales. In turn -- while not eliminating the virus -- this fast
switching policy is sustainable over time, and it mitigates the infection until

  population in China","Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of
the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental
ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all
transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results
for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating
the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel
flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial
fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they
appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,
creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These
movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population
concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the
return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us
to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New
Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread
of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of
keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring
intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These
results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national
distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective
control strategies at a national level.

authorities is to decide what kind of restrictive measures to introduce and
when these should be enforced. In order to take informed decisions in a fully
rational manner, the onset of a critical regime, characterized by an
exponential growth of the contagion, must be identified as quickly as possible.
Providing rigorous quantitative tools to detect such an onset represents an
important contribution from the scientific community to proactively support the
political decision makers. In this paper, leveraging the quickest detection
theory, we propose a mathematical model of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution and
develop decision tools to rapidly detect the passage from a controlled regime
to a critical one. A new sequential test -- referred to as MAST (mean-agnostic
sequential test) -- is presented, and demonstrated on publicly available
COVID-19 infection data from different countries. Then, the performance of MAST
is investigated for the second pandemic wave, showing an effective trade-off
between average decision delay $\Delta$ and risk $R$, where $R$ is inversely
proportional to the time required to declare the need to take unnecessary
restrictive measures. Ideally, the decision mechanism should react as quick as
possible for a given level of risk. We find that all the countries share the
same behaviour in terms of quickest detection, specifically the risk scales
exponentially with the delay, $R \sim \exp{(-\omega \Delta)}$, where $\omega$
depends on the specific nation. For a reasonably small risk level, say, one
possibility in ten thousand (i.e., unmotivated implementation of
countermeasures every 27 years, on the average), the proposed algorithm detects
the onset of the critical regime with delay between a few days to three weeks,
much earlier than when the exponential growth becomes evident.

  Santiago during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Voluntary shelter-in-place directives and lockdowns are the main
non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have used to
contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such
interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that
exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is
that we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility
measures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the
city to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data
linear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing
measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on
socioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while
zones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around
50\% to 90\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions
are only 20\% to 50\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in
higher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary
shelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that
our mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10\%
increase in mobility correlates with a 5\% increase in the rate of infection.
Our results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences
in infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city.
Further, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income
communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be
effective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic
levels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable
their inhabitants to increase compliance.

large-scale attempts to limit travel. While the world-wide reproduction number
briefly dropped below 1 as China implemented extensive public health measures,
the introduction of the virus to other nations swiftly led to an increasing
world-wide average value of R. In Italy, the nation hardest-hit following
China, social distancing measures brought the local value of R down from 3.71
to 2.51. Nonetheless, the value of R in Italy persisted at levels well above 1,

shelter-in-place measures, has dramatically affected ways in which people
communicate with each other, forcing people to find new ways to collaborate,
study, celebrate special occasions, and meet with family and friends. One of
the most popular solutions that have emerged is the use of video conferencing
applications to replace face-to-face meetings with virtual meetings. This
resulted in unprecedented growth in the number of video conferencing users. In
this study, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual
meetings. We extracted private information from collage images of meeting
participants that are publicly posted on the Web. We used image processing,
text recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our web
crawling curated dataset of over 15,700 collage images, and over 142,000 face
images of meeting participants. We demonstrate that video conference users are
facing prevalent security and privacy threats. Our results indicate that it is
relatively easy to collect thousands of publicly available images of video
conference meetings and extract personal information about the participants,
including their face images, age, gender, usernames, and sometimes even full
names. This type of extracted data can vastly and easily jeopardize people's
security and privacy both in the online and real-world, affecting not only
adults but also more vulnerable segments of society, such as young children and
older adults. Finally, we show that cross-referencing facial image data with
social network data may put participants at additional privacy risks they may
not be aware of and that it is possible to identify users that appear in
several video conference meetings, thus providing a potential to maliciously
aggregate different sources of information about a target individual.

immune response system is no different. Therefore, models that attempt to
explain this system need to also incorporate noise or fluctuations that can
account for the observed variability. In this work, a stochastic model of the
immune response system is presented in terms of the dynamics of the T cells and
the virus particles. Making use of the Green's function and the Wilemski-Fixman
approximation, this model is then solved to obtain the analytical expression
for the joint probability density function of these variables in the early and
late stages of infection. This is then also used to calculate the average level
of virus particles in the system. Upon comparing the theoretically predicted
average virus levels to those of COVID-19 patients, it is hypothesized that the
long lived dynamics that are characteristic of such viral infections are due to
the long range correlations in the temporal fluctuations of the virions. This
model therefore provides an insight into the effects of noise on viral
dynamics.

  Smoothers","The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a variety of approaches for managing
infection outbreaks in international populations. One example is mobile phone
applications, which attempt to alert infected individuals and their contacts by
automatically inferring two key components of infection risk: the proximity to
an individual who may be infected, and the duration of proximity. The former
component, proximity, relies on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Received Signal
Strength Indicator(RSSI) as a distance sensor, and this has been shown to be
problematic; not least because of unpredictable variations caused by different
device types, device location on-body, device orientation, the local
environment and the general noise associated with radio frequency propagation.
In this paper, we present an approach that infers posterior probabilities over
distance given sequences of RSSI values. Using a single-dimensional Unscented
Kalman Smoother (UKS) for non-linear state space modelling, we outline several
Gaussian process observation transforms, including: a generative model that
directly captures sources of variation; and a discriminative model that learns
a suitable observation function from training data using both distance and
infection risk as optimisation objective functions. Our results show that good
risk prediction can be achieved in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time on real-world data
sets, with the UKS outperforming more traditional classification methods

  in Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on every human activity and, because of
the urgency of finding the proper responses to such an unprecedented emergency,
it generated a diffused societal debate. The online version of this discussion
was not exempted by the presence of d/misinformation campaigns, but differently
from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -- intentional or
not -- flow of false information put at severe risk the public health, reducing
the effectiveness of governments' countermeasures. In the present manuscript,
we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate
on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on the various discursive communities.
In order to extract the discursive communities, we focus on verified users,
i.e. accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We thus infer
the various discursive communities based on how verified users are perceived by
standard ones: if two verified accounts are considered as similar by non
unverified ones, we link them in the network of certified accounts. We first
observe that, beside being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion
show a clear division in what results to be different political groups. At this
point, by using a commonly available fact-checking software (NewsGuard), we
assess the reputation of the pieces of news exchanged. We filter the network of
retweets (i.e. users re-broadcasting the same elementary piece of information,
or tweet) from random noise and check the presence of messages displaying an
url. The impact of misinformation posts reaches the 22.1% in the right and
center-right wing community and its contribution is even stronger in absolute
numbers, due to the activity of this group: 96% of all non reputable urls

namely COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. We propose a three-stage framework,
named COV-ELM based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Our dataset comprises
CXR images in a frontal view, namely Poster anterior (PA) and Erect
anteroposterior (AP). Stage one deals with preprocessing and transformation,
stage 2 deals with the challenge of extracting relevant features which are
passed as input to the ELM at the third stage, resulting in the identification
of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in this work has been motivated by its
significantly shorter training time as compared to conventional gradient-based
learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets become available, it can be
quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models. We use
10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the results of applying COV-ELM. The
COV-ELM achieved a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity
of ${0.94 \pm 0.02}$ at a 95% confidence interval. When compared to
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is found to
outperform its competitors.

  application to COVID-19","The novelty of new human coronavirus COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 and the lack of
effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed
to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the
repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost
compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we presented a new
network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching
off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), which predicts drug-disease associations by
quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific
proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure
that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same
network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14
selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing
genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic
similarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentatively
repurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we
identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label
drugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs,
actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of
putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential
anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity
values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,
and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by
performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the
network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect
against human coronavirus infections.

  Uncertainty-aware Learning for Robust COVID-19 Detection","The novel 2019 Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has spread world widely and
is currently a major healthcare challenge around the world. Chest Computed
Tomography (CT) and X-ray images have been well recognized to be two effective
techniques for clinical COVID-19 disease diagnoses. Due to faster imaging time
and considerably lower cost than CT, detecting COVID-19 in chest X-ray (CXR)
images is preferred for efficient diagnosis, assessment and treatment. However,
considering the similarity between COVID-19 and pneumonia, CXR samples with
deep features distributed near category boundaries are easily misclassified by
the hyper-planes learned from limited training data. Moreover, most existing
approaches for COVID-19 detection focus on the accuracy of prediction and
overlook the uncertainty estimation, which is particularly important when
dealing with noisy datasets. To alleviate these concerns, we propose a novel
deep network named {\em RCoNet$^k_s$} for robust COVID-19 detection which
employs {\em Deformable Mutual Information Maximization} (DeIM), {\em Mixed
High-order Moment Feature} (MHMF) and {\em Multi-expert Uncertainty-aware
Learning} (MUL). With DeIM, the mutual information (MI) between input data and
the corresponding latent representations can be well estimated and maximized to
capture compact and disentangled representational characteristics. Meanwhile,
MHMF can fully explore the benefits of using high-order statistics and extract
discriminative features of complex distributions in medical imaging. Finally,
MUL creates multiple parallel dropout networks for each CXR image to evaluate
uncertainty and thus prevent performance degradation caused by the noise in the
data.

  in Crowds","Digital contact tracing is being used by many countries to help contain
COVID-19's spread in a post-lockdown world. Among the various available
techniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal
strength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered less of a privacy
risk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS,
cellular-tower history, or QR-code scanning. As of October 2020, there have
been millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contract-tracing apps, as
more and more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of
these apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical
research that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to
fill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of
Bluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80
participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world
gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting
proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially
crowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in
need, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover,
technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused
by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users'
willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still
be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity
of up to 20m lasting for an hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that
existing contact-tracing apps can be re-purposed to focus on coarse-grained
proximity detection, and that future ones calibrate distance estimates and
adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.

selection suffer from data homogeneity, leading to misleading results. We
compile and analyse a viable benchmark dataset from multiple existing
heterogeneous sources. Such a benchmark is important for realistically testing

optimizing medical resources. Forecasting emerging outbreaks pose a particular
challenge because many existing forecasting techniques learn from historical
seasons trends. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM-based cells are a
logical choice of model due to their ability to learn temporal dynamics. In
this paper, we adapt the state and county level influenza model, TDEFSI-LONLY,

an LSTM backbone on national confirmed cases to learn a low dimensional time

since infection, 1. The age distribution $n(t, a)$ of the population at time
$t$ can be described by means of a first-order, one-dimensional partial
differential equation (PDE) known as the McKendrick-von Foerster equation. 2.
The frequency of type $i$ at time $t$ is simply obtained by integrating the
probability $p(a, i)$ of being in state $i$ at age a against the age
distribution $n(t, a)$. The advantage of this approach is three-fold. First,
regardless of the number of types, macroscopic observables (e.g., incidence or
prevalence of each type) only rely on a one-dimensional PDE ""decorated"" with
types. This representation induces a simple methodology based on the
McKendrick-von Foerster PDE with Poisson sampling to infer and forecast the
epidemic. We illustrate this technique using a French data from the COVID-19
epidemic. Second, our approach generalizes and simplifies standard
compartmental models using high-dimensional systems of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs) to account for disease complexity. We show that such models
can always be rewritten in our framework, thus, providing a low-dimensional yet
equivalent representation of these complex models. Third, beyond the simplicity
of the approach, we show that our population model naturally appears as a
universal scaling limit of a large class of fully stochastic individual-based
epidemic models, here the initial condition of the PDE emerges as the limiting
age structure of an exponentially growing population starting from a single
individual.

  Protocols","During the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, Contact Tracing emerged as an
essential tool for managing the epidemic. App-based solutions have emerged for
Contact Tracing, including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced
by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol contains two
well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly that when someone is marked
as having tested positive and their keys are made public, they can be tracked
over a large geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the app
requires a minimum exposure duration to register a contact, there is no
cryptographic guarantee for this property. This means an adversary can scan
Bluetooth networks and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel
""cross hashing"" approach to cryptographically guarantee minimum exposure
durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour data exposure of infected
individuals and reduce computational time for identifying if a user has been
exposed using $k$-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection. We
empirically demonstrate that this modified protocol can offer like-for-like
efficacy to the existing protocol.

research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum
approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive
design. The Leaky ReLU was leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum
principles of entanglement and superposition were applied to derive the
proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation
functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in
TensorFlow and Keras. This original approach is effective and validated
extensively in case studies that facilitate the detection of COVID-19 and
Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were evaluated in
a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets,
including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients
with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound
images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy
controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall
higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by
either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating

  preventing respiratory infections has been underestimated","Face masks have been widely used as a protective measure against COVID-19.
However, pre-pandemic empirical studies have produced mixed statistical results
on the effectiveness of masks against respiratory viruses. The implications of
the studies' recognized limitations have not been quantitatively and
statistically analyzed, leading to confusion regarding the effectiveness of
masks. Such confusion may have contributed to organizations such as the WHO and
CDC initially not recommending that the general public wear masks. Here we show
that when the adherence to mask-usage guidelines is taken into account, the
empirical evidence indicates that masks prevent disease transmission: all
studies we analyzed that did not find surgical masks to be effective were
under-powered to such an extent that even if masks were 100% effective, the
studies in question would still have been unlikely to find a statistically
significant effect. We also provide a framework for understanding the effect of
masks on the probability of infection for single and repeated exposures. The
framework demonstrates that more frequently wearing a mask provides
super-linearly compounding protection, as does both the susceptible and
infected individual wearing a mask. This work shows (1) that both theoretical
and empirical evidence is consistent with masks protecting against respiratory
infections and (2) that nonlinear effects and statistical considerations
regarding the percentage of exposures for which masks are worn must be taken
into account when designing empirical studies and interpreting their results.

  measures and lower his/her turnover intention","An important theme is how to maximize the cooperation of employees when
dealing with crisis measures taken by the company. Therefore, to find out what
kind of employees have cooperated with the company's measures in the current
corona (COVID-19) crisis, and what effect the cooperation has had to these
employees/companies to get hints for preparing for the next crisis, the pass
analysis was carried out using awareness data obtained from a questionnaire
survey conducted on 2,973 employees of Japanese companies in China. The results
showed that employees with higher social capital and resilience were more
supportive of the company's measures against corona and that employees who were
more supportive of corona measures were less likely to leave their jobs.
However, regarding fatigue and anxiety about the corona felt by employees, it
was shown that it not only works to support cooperation in corona
countermeasures but also enhances the turnover intention. This means that just
by raising the anxiety of employees, even if a company achieves the short-term
goal of having them cooperate with the company's countermeasures against
corona, it may not reach the longer-term goal by making them increase their
intention to leave. It is important for employees to be aware of the crisis and
to fear it properly. But more than that, it should be possible for the company
to help employees stay resilient, build good relationships with them, and
increase their social capital to make them support crisis measurement of the
company most effectively while keeping their turnover intention low.

  COVID-19 Streamline Diagnostic","In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, deep learning methods have been widely
investigated in detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays. However, a more pragmatic
approach to applying AI methods to a medical diagnosis is designing a framework
that facilitates human-machine interaction and expert decision making. Studies
have shown that categorization can play an essential rule in accelerating
real-world decision making. Inspired by descriptive document clustering, we
propose a domain-independent explanatory clustering framework to group
contextually related instances and support radiologists' decision making. While
most descriptive clustering approaches employ domain-specific characteristics
to form meaningful clusters, we focus on model-level explanation as a more
general-purpose element of every learning process to achieve cluster
homogeneity. We employ DeepSHAP to generate homogeneous clusters in terms of
disease severity and describe the clusters using favorable and unfavorable
saliency maps, which visualize the class discriminating regions of an image.
These human-interpretable maps complement radiologist knowledge to investigate
the whole cluster at once. Besides, as part of this study, we evaluate a model
based on VGG-19, which can identify COVID and pneumonia cases with a positive
predictive value of 95% and 97%, respectively, comparable to the recent
explainable approaches for COVID diagnosis.

isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on
tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and
only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of
the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests
for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the
outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions
emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded)
relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is
unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on
the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists
no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring
or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing
policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any
second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is
within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and
tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000
tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for
which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative
analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent
serological studies.

in the world. A lockdown for a period of 2 months, due to the pandemic, was
enough to cause a drop of 7% of the anthropogonic CO2 in the atmosphere. In
addition to the world in general, the excess of the anthropogonic CO2 emission
in the atmosphere has always been a threat to the oceans as well. Oceans play a
key role to buffer the greenhouse effect, but in the process, it becomes
warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated. While there have already been
investigations done on the effect of pandemic on atmosphere, the question what
happens to oceans during the pandemic remains unanswered. The aim of this paper
is to study the pandemic's effect and the resultant reduction in CO2 emissions
on the productivity of the global oceans. Often Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a),
Particulate organic and inorganic carbon (PIC:POC) and sea surface
temperature(SST), are used to indicate the productivity of oceans. Herein,
satellite-derived estimates of the aforementioned parameters are used. Based on
these estimates, a drop in Chl-a (0.5 mgm-3) is observed off Alaska, North
Europe,South China and Southeast USA during the pandemic. CO2 reduction of 123
MtCO2 during the pandemic in China might have caused reduction in mean Chl-a by
around 5% (2.5 to 1.6 mgm-3). Reduction of Chl-a during the pandemic is mostly
associated with the reduction of PIC:POC. The pandemic demonstrates noticeable
effect on Chl-a and/or SST. A cooling response of 0.5 oC in mean SST is
observed over most of the coastal areas, especially off Alaska,north Indian
ocean and eastern Pacific. The decrease in the CO2 emissions in India by 30%
during the pandemic translates into a drop of mean SST in the north Indian
ocean by 5% (from 29.95 to 28.46 oC). All these suggest that maintaining global
activities as sustainable as the pandemic period, can help to recover the
oceans.

one of the key symptoms. Studies show that in these cases, voice production is
also adversely affected -- vocal fold oscillations are asynchronous,
asymmetrical and more restricted during phonation. This paper proposes a method
that analyzes the differential dynamics of the glottal flow waveform (GFW)
during voice production to identify features in them that are most significant
for the detection of COVID-19 from voice. Since it is hard to measure this
directly in COVID-19 patients, we infer it from recorded speech signals and
compare it to the GFW computed from physical model of phonation. For normal
voices, the difference between the two should be minimal, since physical models
are constructed to explain phonation under assumptions of normalcy. Greater
differences implicate anomalies in the bio-physical factors that contribute to
the correctness of the physical model, revealing their significance indirectly.
Our proposed method uses a CNN-based 2-step attention model that locates
anomalies in time-feature space in the difference of the two GFWs, allowing us
to infer their potential as discriminative features for classification. The
viability of this method is demonstrated using a clinically curated dataset of
COVID-19 positive and negative subjects.

another useful metric of infection spread, $R_t$, the time-varying average
reproduction number which indicates the average number of individuals an
infected person would infect in turn. The proposed approach also allows for
quantification of uncertainty in the estimates of $R_t$ and $\Gamma_t$ in the

The widespread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 resulted with a tsunami of social
media. Most platforms were used to transmit relevant news, guidelines and

  COVID-19 Outbreak Simulation Model","Motivation: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential
for successful implementation of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing
the disease spread. With a limited number of daily COVID19 tests performed in
every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect
of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in
managing the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce
COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that
evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and
provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should
be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a
geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused
by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as
environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation
measures.
  Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the
policy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days
to prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing
the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity
need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average
of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike
existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the
daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model
is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios
under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very
effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the

The results showed that, the reduction in electricity production is significant
to the short-term variability of atmospheric CO$_2$. It also highlights the
significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO$_2$, which suggests
that, without the national restriction of activities, CO$_2$ concentration are
set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and
sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the
atmospheric CO$_2$ reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved,
if electricity production from combustible sources were slashed, which could be
useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production
from combustible sources, and the impact of these reduction to the atmospheric
CO$_2$.

  Available CT-scan Dataset of COVID-19","The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 threatens humans life all around the world.
Due to insufficient diagnostic infrastructures, developing an accurate,
efficient, inexpensive, and quick diagnostic tool is of great importance. As
chest radiography, such as chest X-ray (CXR) and CT computed tomography (CT),
is a possible way for screening COVID-19, developing an automatic image
classification tool is immensely helpful for detecting the patients with
COVID-19. To date, researchers have proposed several different screening
methods; however, none of them could achieve a reliable and highly sensitive
performance yet. The main drawbacks of current methods are the lack of having
enough training data, low generalization performance, and a high rate of
false-positive detection. To tackle such limitations, this study firstly builds
a large-size publicly available CT-scan dataset, consisting of more than 13k
CT-images of more than 1000 individuals, in which 8k images are taken from 500
patients infected with COVID-19. Secondly, we propose a deep learning model for
screening COVID-19 using our proposed CT dataset and report the baseline
results. Finally, we extend the proposed CT model for screening COVID-19 from
CXR images using a transfer learning approach. The experimental results show
that the proposed CT and CXR methods achieve the AUC scores of 0.886 and 0.984

  single and multi-layer face masks","By now it is well-understood that the usage of facemasks provides protection
from transmission of viral loads through exhalation and inhalation of
respiratory droplets. Therefore, during the current Covid-19 pandemic the usage
of face masks is strongly recommended by health officials. Although three-layer
masks are generally advised for usage, many commonly available or homemade
masks contain only single and double layers. In this study, we show through
detailed physics based analyses and high speed imaging that high momentum cough
droplets on impingement on single- and double-layer masks can lead to
significant partial penetration and more importantly atomization into numerous
much smaller daughter droplets, thereby increasing the total population of the
aerosol, which can remain suspended for a longer time. The possibility of
secondary atomization of high momentum cough droplets due to impingement,
hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous
network of the mask has not been explored before. However, this unique mode of
aerosol generation poses a finite risk of infection as shown in this work. We
also demonstrate that in single layer masks close to 70 % of a given droplet
volume is atomized and only 30 % is trapped within the fibers. The entrapped
volume is close to 90 % for double layer masks which still allows some
atomization into smaller droplets. We however found that a triple-layer
surgical mask permits negligible penetration and hence should be effective in
preventing disease transmission.

universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one
employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR
(susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing
individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1)
significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a
population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the
population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking
is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when
universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower
filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we
compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected
that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies,
their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily
case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early
universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or
reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical
simulations.
  Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of
universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is
emerging as a key NPI; a ""mouth-and-nose lockdown"" is far more sustainable than
a ""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An

production reflect seasonality, weather conditions, working days, and more
recently the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, for the first time we
provide a daily CO$_2$ emission dataset for the whole year of 2020 calculated
from inventory and near-real-time activity data (called Carbon Monitor project:
https://carbonmonitor.org). It was previously suggested from preliminary
estimates that did not cover the entire year of 2020 that the pandemics may
have caused more than 8% annual decline of global CO$_2$ emissions. Here we
show from detailed estimates of the full year data that the global reduction
was only 5.4% (-1,901 MtCO$_2$, ). This decrease is 5 times larger than the
annual emission drop at the peak of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However,
global CO$_2$ emissions gradually recovered towards 2019 levels from late April
with global partial re-opening. More importantly, global CO$_2$ emissions even
increased slightly by +0.9% in December 2020 compared with 2019, indicating the
trends of rebound of global emissions. Later waves of COVID-19 infections in
late 2020 and corresponding lockdowns have caused further CO$_2$ emissions
reductions particularly in western countries, but to a much smaller extent than
the declines in the first wave. That even substantial world-wide lockdowns of
activity led to a one-time decline in global CO$_2$ emissions of only 5.4% in
one year highlights the significant challenges for climate change mitigation
that we face in the post-COVID era. These declines are significant, but will be
quickly overtaken with new emissions unless the COVID-19 crisis is utilized as
a break-point with our fossil-fuel trajectory, notably through policies that
make the COVID-19 recovery an opportunity to green national energy and
development plans.

nonsymptomatic contacts are fundamental strategies for mitigating the current
COVID-19 pandemic. The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary
strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital
(app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness
using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the
activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network
dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual
tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into
account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure.
This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during
the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the
intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision
to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual
tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not
adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while
they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show
that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic
hybrid protocols.

similar frameworks for modeling economic behavior as invented in physics. This
has not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the
neoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static
framework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic
quantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a
positive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these
problems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking
firm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,
currently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future
bankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can
solve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several
parameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model
of a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the
reasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in
physics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is
more important for the development of economics than pure mathematics. (JEL

tens of thousands of lives in 2020. Many cases of COVID-19 escalate from Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) to viral pneumonia to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) to death. Extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO)
is a life-sustaining oxygenation and ventilation therapy that may be used for
patients with severe ARDS when mechanical ventilation is insufficient to
sustain life. While early planning and surgical cannulation for ECMO can
increase survival, clinicians report the lack of a risk score hinders these
efforts. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to develop the
PEER score, used to highlight critically ill patients with viral or unspecified
pneumonia at high risk of mortality or decompensation in a subpopulation
eligible for ECMO. The PEER score is validated on two large, publicly available
critical care databases and predicts mortality at least as well as other
existing risk scores. Stratifying our cohorts into low-risk and high-risk
groups, we find that the high-risk group also has a higher proportion of
decompensation indicators such as vasopressor and ventilator use. Finally, the
PEER score is provided in the form of a nomogram for direct calculation of
patient risk, and can be used to highlight at-risk patients among critical care
patients eligible for ECMO.

and disseminating computing research. Traditional venues for reviewing and
publishing, such as conferences and journals, worked effectively in the past.
Recently, trends have created new opportunities but also put new pressures on
the process of review and dissemination. For example, many conferences have
seen large increases in the number of submissions. Likewise, dissemination of
research ideas has become dramatically through publication venues such as
arXiv.org and social media networks. While these trends predate COVID-19, the
pandemic could accelerate longer term changes. Based on interviews with leading
academics in computing research, our findings include: (1) Trends impacting
computing research are largely positive and have increased the participation,
scope, accessibility, and speed of the research process. (2) Challenges remain
in securing the integrity of the process, including addressing ways to scale
the review process, avoiding attempts to misinform or confuse the dissemination
of results, and ensuring fairness and broad participation in the process
itself. Based on these findings, we recommend: (1) Regularly polling members of
the computing research community, including program and general conference
chairs, journal editors, authors, reviewers, etc., to identify specific
challenges they face to better understand these issues. (2) An influential
body, such as the Computing Research Association regularly issues a ""State of
the Computing Research Enterprise"" report to update the community on trends,
both positive and negative, impacting the computing research enterprise. (3) A
deeper investigation, specifically to better understand the influence that
social media and preprint archives have on computing research, is conducted.

strategic response to COVID-19. However, the concept of virtual teams is not
something new, with many businesses over the past three decades gradually
incorporating virtual and/or dispersed teams into their processes. Research on

such as trust, communication, teamwork, leadership and collaboration. This
paper introduces a new paradigm for examining the development of virtual teams,
arguably one that would facilitate the consideration of technology as part of a
virtual team rather than simply as an alternate to face-to-face teams. That is,
viewing the development of virtual teams with embedded technology within an

  Meteorological Factors","In this paper, we propose a dynamical model to describe the transmission of
COVID-19, which is spreading in China and many other countries. To avoid a
larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of
strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine
is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to
estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into
seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and
officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model
is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the
transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend
of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role
in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The
control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and
discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is
in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human
transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may
become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease
is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the
virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index
is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high
and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail
vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the
effectiveness of efficient vaccination. Once the vaccine comes into use, the
numerical simulation provide a promptly prospective research.

demand decrease of about $64\%$ (IATA, April 2020) which triggered already
several bankruptcies of airline companies all over the world. While the
robustness of the world airline network (WAN) was mostly studied as an
homogeneous network, we introduce a new tool for analyzing the impact of a
company failure: the `airline company network' where two airlines are connected
if they share at least one route segment. Using this tool, we observe that the
failure of companies well connected with others has the largest impact on the
connectivity of the WAN. We then explore how the global demand reduction
affects airlines differently, and provide an analysis of different scenarios if
its stays low and does not come back to its pre-crisis level. Using traffic
data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and simple assumptions about
customer's airline choice strategies, we find that the local effective demand
can be much lower than the average one, especially for companies that are not
monopolistic and share their segments with larger companies. Even if the
average demand comes back to $60\%$ of the total capacity, we find that between
$46\%$ and $59\%$ of the companies could experience a reduction of more than
$50\%$ of their traffic, depending on the type of competitive advantage that
drives customer's airline choice. These results highlight how the complex
competitive structure of the WAN weakens its robustness when facing such a
large crisis.

from smartphone and wearable devices and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062
participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the UK, and the Netherlands.
We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum
distance travelled from home, maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby
devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate,
sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We
performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post-hoc Dunns tests to assess
differences in these features among baseline, pre-, and during-lockdown
periods. We also studied behavioural differences by age, gender, body mass
index (BMI), and educational background. We were able to quantify expected
changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby
Bluetooth-enabled devices between pre- and during-lockdown periods. We saw
reduced sociality as measured through mobility features, and increased virtual
sociality through phone usage. People were more active on their phones,
spending more time using social media apps, particularly around major news
events. Furthermore, participants had lower heart rate, went to bed later, and
slept more. We also found that young people had longer homestay than older
people during lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant
difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low
BMI group walked more. RADAR-base can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a
holistic view of behavioural changes in response to public health interventions

mass-vaccination approach in which a targeted group of the population
comprising healthcare workers, aged-care residents and other individuals at
increased risk of exposure will receive a highly effective priority vaccine.
The rest of the population will instead have access to a less effective
vaccine. We apply a large-scale agent-based model of COVID-19 in Australia to
investigate the possible implications of this hybrid approach to
mass-vaccination. The model is calibrated to recent epidemiological and
demographic data available in Australia, and accounts for several components of
vaccine efficacy. Within a feasible range of vaccine efficacy values, our model
supports the assertion that complete herd immunity due to vaccination is not
likely in the Australian context. For realistic scenarios in which herd
immunity is not achieved, we simulate the effects of mass-vaccination on
epidemic growth rate, and investigate the requirements of lockdown measures
applied to curb subsequent outbreaks. In our simulations, Australia's
vaccination strategy can feasibly reduce required lockdown intensity and
initial epidemic growth rate by 43\% and 52\%, respectively. The severity of
epidemics, as measured by the peak number of daily new cases, decreases by up
to two orders of magnitude under plausible mass-vaccination and lockdown
strategies. The study presents a strong argument for a large-scale vaccination
campaign, which would significantly reduce the intensity of non-pharmaceutical
interventions in Australia and curb future outbreaks.

(Coronavirus disease) implications address droplets' dynamics in quiescent
environments. As most droplets in a common situation are immersed in external
flows (such as ambient flows), we consider the effect of canonical flow
profiles namely, shear flow, Poiseuille flow, and unsteady shear flow on the
transport of spherical droplets of radius ranging from 5$\mu$m to 100 $\mu $m,
which are characteristic lengths in human talking, coughing or sneezing
processes. The dynamics we employ satisfies the Maxey-Riley (M-R) equation. An
order-of-magnitude estimate allows us to solve the M-R equation to leading
order analytically, and to higher order (accounting for the Boussinesq-Basset
memory term) numerically. Discarding evaporation, our results to leading order
indicate that the maximum travelled distance for small droplets ($5\mu m$
radius) under a shear/Poiseuille external flow with a maximum flow speed of
$1m/s$ may easily reach more than 250 meters, since those droplets remain in
the air for around 600 seconds. The maximum travelled distance was also
calculated to leading and higher orders, and it is observed that there is a
small difference between the leading and higher order results, and that it
depends on the strength of the flow. For example, this difference for droplets
of radius $5\mu m$ in a shear flow, and with a maximum wind speed of $5m/s$, is
seen to be around $2m$. In general, higher order terms are observed to slightly
enhance droplets' dispersion and their flying time.

from CT images. In this paper, we propose a belief function-based convolutional
neural network with semi-supervised training to detect Covid-19 cases. Our
method first extracts deep features, maps them into belief degree maps and
makes the final classification decision. Our results are more reliable and
explainable than those of traditional deep learning-based classification
models. Experimental results show that our approach is able to achieve a good
performance with an accuracy of 0.81, an F1 of 0.812 and an AUC of 0.875.

  COVID-19 Data-sets","The Coronavirus (COVID-19), which is an infectious pulmonary disorder, has
affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the
WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of
causing severe conditions in the patients, the development of rapid and
accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse
transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence
of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples. But, RT-PCR
suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore,
the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of
COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage
exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for
X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which can be used
by radiologists as a supporting tool in COVID-19 detection, has been proposed.
Deep feature sets extracted by using CNNs were concatenated for feature level
fusion and fed to multiple classifiers in terms of decision level fusion idea
with the aim of discriminating COVID-19, pneumonia and no-finding classes. In
the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the
resultant decisions of classifiers. The obtained accuracy values and confusion
matrix based evaluation criteria were presented for three progressively created
data-sets. The aspects of the proposed method that are superior to existing
COVID-19 detection studies have been discussed and the fusion performance of
proposed approach was validated visually by using Class Activation Mapping
technique. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has
attained high COVID-19 detection performance that was proven by its comparable
accuracy and superior precision/recall values with the existing studies.

coronavirus 2, emerged into a world being rapidly transformed by artificial
intelligence (AI) based on big data, computational power and neural networks.
The gaze of these networks has in recent years turned increasingly towards
applications in healthcare. It was perhaps inevitable that COVID-19, a global
disease propagating health and economic devastation, should capture the
attention and resources of the world's computer scientists in academia and
industry. The potential for AI to support the response to the pandemic has been
proposed across a wide range of clinical and societal challenges, including
disease forecasting, surveillance and antiviral drug discovery. This is likely
to continue as the impact of the pandemic unfolds on the world's people,
industries and economy but a surprising observation on the current pandemic has
been the limited impact AI has had to date in the management of COVID-19. This
correspondence focuses on exploring potential reasons behind the lack of
successful adoption of AI models developed for COVID-19 diagnosis and
prognosis, in front-line healthcare services. We highlight the moving clinical
needs that models have had to address at different stages of the epidemic, and
explain the importance of translating models to reflect local healthcare
environments. We argue that both basic and applied research are essential to
accelerate the potential of AI models, and this is particularly so during a
rapidly evolving pandemic. This perspective on the response to COVID-19, may
provide a glimpse into how the global scientific community should react to
combat future disease outbreaks more effectively.

for predicting the Covid 19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced
countries. The second is to report and discuss the results obtained with this
approach for Brazilian states, as of May 4th, 2020. We start by presenting
preliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are
somewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial
clustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the
pandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered
features representing a country response to the early spread of the pandemic. A
Modified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to
predict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to
estimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve
fitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution
that best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks
of the pandemic. Results indicate that the pandemic is still growing in Brazil,
with most states peaks of infection estimated between the 25th of April and the

less reach and a higher degree of segregation and isolation. Overall, the
emerging communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and

minimize the probability of undetected asymptomatic cases. Every day, the
probability of infection of the different individuals is updated making use of
the stochastic model of the phenomenon and of the information collected in the
previous days. Simulations for a closed community of 10000 individuals show

viral diseases. This has accelerated the efforts to model and forecast the
disease spreading, in order to find ways to confine the spreading regionally

spreading of viral infections due to human spatial mobility and adapted it to
the latest COVID-19 pandemic. In this the region to be modelled is overlaid
with a two-dimensional grid weighted with the population density defined cells,
in each of which a compartmental SEIRS system of delay difference equations
simulate the local dynamics (microdynamics) of the disease. The infections
between cells are stochastic and allow for the geographical spreading of the
virus over the two-dimensional space (macrodynamics). This approach allows to
separate the parameters related to the biological aspects of the disease from
the ones that represent the spatial contagious behaviour through different
kinds of mobility of people acting as virus carriers. These provide sufficient
information to trace the evolution of the pandemic in different situations. In
particular we have applied this approach to three in many ways different

  epidemic models","The adoption of containment measures to reduce the amplitude of the epidemic
peak is a key aspect in tackling the rapid spread of an epidemic. Classical
compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the
effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. The
importance of social structure, such as the age dependence that proved
essential in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, must be considered, and in addition,
the available data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of
uncertainty must be incorporated into the model from the beginning. In this
work we address these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of a
socially structured epidemic model in presence of uncertain data. After the
introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous
approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled
compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The
need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the
social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global
strategy. The timing and intensity of interventions, however, is particularly
relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected
people. Simulations related to data from the first wave of the recent COVID-19

hunt for trolls on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Trolls, poised
to disrupt the online discourse and spread disinformation, quickly seized the
absence of a credible response to COVID-19 and created a COVID-19 infodemic by
promulgating dubious content on Twitter. To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the
TrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set
of Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to
troll. TrollHunter achieved 98.5% accuracy, 75.4% precision and 69.8% recall

introducing a network and epidemic model, we derive the number of tests used
under network grouping. We prove the expected number of tests is upper bounded
by Dorfman testing. In addition, we demonstrate network grouping successfully
achieves the theoretical lower bound for two-stage testing procedures when
networks have strong community structure. On the other hand, network grouping
is equivalent to Dorfman testing when networks have no structure. We end by
demonstrating network grouping outperforms Dorfman testing in the scenario of a
university testing its population for COVID-19 cases.

  Example of Flu in a Swiss Hospital","Viruses causing flu or milder coronavirus colds are often referred to as
""seasonal viruses"" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words,
meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this
information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In
this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals
in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from
patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We
propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of
positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds
of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these
distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations
to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological
conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar
variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings
highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a
related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under
different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be
easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced
approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as
those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is
at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the
proposed method is assessed through a simulation study.

  Become Epidemic Hotspots?","Multiple small- to middle-scale cities, mostly located in northern China,
became epidemic hotspots during the second wave of the spread of COVID-19 in
early 2021. Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic
causes, it remains unclear how this pattern could be accounted for from a
quantitative approach. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard
index (EpiRank), we came up with a mathematical explanation for this
phenomenon. The index is constructed from epidemic simulations on a multi-layer
transportation network model on top of local SEIR transmission dynamics, which
characterizes intra- and inter-city compartment population flow with a detailed
mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted cities
possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large regional
population and small inter-city transportation. The proposed index, dynamic and
applicable to different epidemic settings, could be a useful indicator for the
risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China; the
model framework is modularized and can be adapted for other nations without
much difficulty.

  COVID-19","Countries highly exposed to incoming traffic from China were expected to be
at the highest risk of COVID-19 spread. However, COVID-19 case numbers
(infection levels) are negatively correlated with incoming traffic-level.
Moreover, infection levels are positively correlated with population-size,
while the latter should only affect infection-level once herd immunity is
reached. These could be explained if a low-virulence strain (LVS) began
spreading a few months earlier from China, providing immunity from the later
emerging known SARS-CoV-2 high-virulence strain (HVS). We find that the
dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic depend on the LVS and HVS spread
doubling-times and the delay between their initial onsets. We find that LVS
doubling-time to be $T_L\sim1.59\pm0.17$ times slower than the HVS ($T_H$), but
its earlier onset allowed its global wide-spread to the levels required for
herd-immunity. In countries exposed earlier to the LVS and/or having smaller
population-size, the LVS achieved herd-immunity earlier, allowing less time for
the spread of the HVS, and giving rise to lower HVS-infection levels. Such
model accurately predicts a country's infection-level ({\rm R^{2}=0.74};
p-value of {\rm 5.2\times10^{-13}}), given only its population-size and
incoming-traffic from China. It explains the negative correlation with
incoming-traffic ($c_{exp}$), the positive correlation with the population size
(n_{pop}) and their specific relations (${\rm N}_{{\rm cases}}\propto
n_{pop}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}}}}\times c_{exp}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}-1}}}$).
We find that most countries should have already achieved herd-immunity. Further
COVID-19-spread in these countries is limited and is not expected to rise by
more than a factor of 2-3. We suggest tests/predictions to further verify the
model and biologically identify the LVS, and discuss the implications.

capacity planning. In many situations, reliable data is not available. We
introduce the BuB simulator, which requires only the specification of plausible
intervals for the simulation parameters. By performing a surrogate-model based
optimization, improved simulation model parameters can be determined.
Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis can be performed, which allows
deep insights into the most important model parameters and their interactions.
This information can be used to screen the parameters that should be further
investigated. To exemplify our approach, a capacity and resource planning task
for a hospital was simulated and optimized. The study explicitly covers
difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be shown, that even if
only limited real-world data is available, the BuB simulator can be
beneficially used to consider worst- and best-case scenarios. The BuB simulator
can be extended in many ways, e.g., by adding further resources (personal
protection equipment, staff, pharmaceuticals) or by specifying several cohorts
(based on age, health status, etc.).

  SARS-CoV","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic clock is ticking and the survival of many
of mankind's modern institutions and or survival of many individuals is at
stake. There is a need for treatments to significantly reduce the morbidity and
mortality of COVID-19. Hence, we delved deep into the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
is the virus that has caused COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is from the same family as
SARS-CoV in which three small viral RNAs (svRNA) were recently identified;
those svRNAs play a significant role in the virus pathogenesis in mice.
  Contribution: In this paper, we report potential orthologs of those three
svRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Instead of off-the-shelf search and alignment
algorithms, which failed to discover the orthologs, we used a special alignment
scoring that does not penalize C/T and A/G mismatches as much as the other
mutations. RNA bases C and U both can bind to G; similarly, A and G both can
bind to U, hence, our scoring. We also validate this hypothesis using a novel,
independent computational experiment. To validate our results, we confirmed the
discovered orthologs are fully conserved in all the tested publicly available
genomes of various strains of SARS-CoV-2; the loci at which the SARS-CoV-2
orthologs occur are close to the loci at which SARS-CoV svRNAs occur. We also
report potential targets for these svRNAs. We hypothesize that the discovered
orthologs play a role in pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, and therefore,
antagomir-mediated inhibition of these SARS-CoV-2 svRNAs inhibits COVID-19.

the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the
rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is
cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large
number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital
contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact
tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements
and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact
tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed
that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better
controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the
collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption
rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy.
In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in
multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for

challenges of complicated diagnosis at a very early stage of infection, where
an efficient lesion segmentation network is optimized initially which is later
integrated into a joint optimization framework for the diagnosis and severity
prediction tasks providing feature enhancement of the infected regions.
Moreover, for overcoming the challenges with diffused, blurred, and varying

semantic gaps in subsequent encoding decoding stages, with immense
parallelization of multi-scale features for faster convergence providing
considerable performance improvement over traditional networks. Furthermore, a
novel tri-level attention mechanism has been introduced, which is repeatedly

local and global scales, such as influenza A(H1N1), SARS, MERS, and recently
COVID-19 disease, makes it crucial to keep designing models of disease
propagation and strategies to prevent or mitigate their effects in populations.
Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context,
especially in human contact networks, here we examine the
susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex
network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a
fraction $q$ of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through
weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or
disordered); weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using
branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing
strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the
intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find
that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic
can be prevented, increase with the overlap $q$. Also we study the effect of
the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals,
which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find
that for relatively small values of the overlap $q$, social distancing policies
might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.

  X-ray Images","Computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR) have been the two dominant
imaging modalities deployed for improved management of Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Due to faster imaging, less radiation exposure, and being
cost-effective CXR is preferred over CT. However, the interpretation of CXR
images, compared to CT, is more challenging due to low image resolution and
COVID-19 image features being similar to regular pneumonia. Computer-aided
diagnosis via deep learning has been investigated to help mitigate these
problems and help clinicians during the decision-making process. The
requirement for a large amount of labeled data is one of the major problems of
deep learning methods when deployed in the medical domain. To provide a
solution to this, in this work, we propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL)
approach using minimal data for training. We integrate local-phase CXR image
features into a multi-feature convolutional neural network architecture where
the training of SSL method is obtained with a teacher/student paradigm.
Quantitative evaluation is performed on 8,851 normal (healthy), 6,045

  vaccination rates","The initial period of vaccination shows strong heterogeneity between
countries' vaccinations rollout, both in the terms of the start of the
vaccination process and in the dynamics of the number of people that are
vaccinated. A predominant thesis in the ongoing debate on the drivers of this
observed heterogeneity is that a key determinant of the swift and extensive
vaccine rollout is state capacity. Here, we utilize two measures that quantify
different aspects of the state capacity: i) the external capacity (measured
through the soft power and the economic power of the country) and ii) the
internal capacity (measured via the country's government effectiveness) and
investigate their relationship with the coronavirus vaccination outcome in the
initial period (up to 30th January 2021). By using data on 189 countries and a
two-step Heckman approach, we find that the economic power of the country and
its soft power are robust determinants of whether a country has started with
the vaccination process. In addition, the government effectiveness is a key
factor that determines vaccine roll-out. Altogether, our findings are in line
with the hypothesis that state capacity determines the observed heterogeneity
between countries in the initial period of COVID-19 vaccines rollout.

epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective
preventive measures to control this pandemic. Therefore, in this paper, an
optimization problem is formulated that accommodates both isolation and social
distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we solve
the formulated problem by applying a noncooperative game that can provide an
incentive for maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is interpreted with the
help of our proposed game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social
distancing where there exists a Nash equilibrium. Finally, we perform an
extensive numerical analysis that shows the effectiveness of the proposed
approach in terms of achieving the desired social-distancing to prevent the
outbreak of the COVID-19 in a noncooperative environment. Numerical results
show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing
percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The
numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home
isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of
individuals.

mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. Such models are usually defined
as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided into
compartments based on qualitative characteristics, with different assumptions
about the nature and rate of transfer across compartments. Though most commonly
formulated as ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, in which the
compartments depend only on time, recent works have also focused on partial
differential equation (PDE) models, incorporating the variation of an epidemic
in space. Such research on PDE models within a Susceptible, Infected, Exposed,

reproducing COVID-19 contagion dynamics. In this paper, we assess the
robustness of this modeling framework by considering different geometries over
more extended periods than in other similar studies. We first validate our code

  Patterns Detection in X-ray Images","Confronting the pandemic of COVID-19, is nowadays one of the most prominent
challenges of the human species. A key factor in slowing down the virus
propagation is the rapid diagnosis and isolation of infected patients. The
standard method for COVID-19 identification, the Reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction method, is time-consuming and in short supply due to
the pandemic. Thus, researchers have been looking for alternative screening
methods and deep learning applied to chest X-rays of patients has been showing
promising results. Despite their success, the computational cost of these
methods remains high, which imposes difficulties to their accessibility and
availability. Thus, the main goal of this work is to propose an accurate yet
efficient method in terms of memory and processing time for the problem of
COVID-19 screening in chest X-rays. Methods: To achieve the defined objective
we exploit and extend the EfficientNet family of deep artificial neural
networks which are known for their high accuracy and low footprints in other
applications. We also exploit the underlying taxonomy of the problem with a
hierarchical classifier. A dataset of 13,569 X-ray images divided into healthy,
non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19 patients is used to train the proposed
approaches and other 5 competing architectures. Finally, 231 images of the
three classes were used to assess the quality of the methods. Results: The
results show that the proposed approach was able to produce a high-quality

positive prediction of 100%, while having from 5 to 30 times fewer parameters

dioxide (CO2) emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 20601.
The surprise announcement came in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which
caused a transient drop in China's emissions in the first half of 2020. Here,
we show an unprecedented de-carbonization of China's power system in late 2020:
although China's power related carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than
2019, the majority (92.9%) of the increased power demand was met by increases
in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear) generation (increased by 9.3%), as
compared to only 0.4% increase for fossil fuels. China's low-carbon generation
in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of
36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when
the fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the
carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of
519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power
demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of
China's power demand could be provided by low carbon sources. Our results thus
reveal that China made progress towards its carbon neutrality target during the
pandemic, and suggest the potential for substantial further decarbonization in
the next few years if the latest trends persist.

from marketing to higher security environments like online banking. This is now
especially relevant since e.g. periocular verification is contactless, and
thereby safe to use in pandemics such as COVID-19. However, selfie-based
biometrics faces some challenges since there is limited control over the data
acquisition conditions. Therefore, super-resolution has to be used to increase
the quality of the captured images. Most of the state of the art
super-resolution methods use deep networks with large filters, thereby needing
to train and store a correspondingly large number of parameters, and making
their use difficult for mobile devices commonly used for selfie-based.
  In order to achieve an efficient super-resolution method, we propose an
Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution (ESISR) algorithm, which takes into
account a trade-off between the efficiency of the deep neural network and the
size of its filters. To that end, the method implements a novel loss function
based on the Sharpness metric. This metric turns out to be more suitable for
increasing the quality of the eye images. Our method drastically reduces the
number of parameters when compared with Deep CNNs with Skip Connection and
Network (DCSCN): from 2,170,142 to 28,654 parameters when the image size is
increased by a factor of x3. Furthermore, the proposed method keeps the sharp
quality of the images, which is highly relevant for biometric recognition
purposes. The results on remote verification systems with raw images reached an
Equal Error Rate (EER) of 8.7% for FaceNet and 10.05% for VGGFace. Where

  Mila's Proposal for a Contact Tracing App","Contact tracing has grown in popularity as a promising solution to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of automated contact tracing are two-fold.
Contact tracing promises to reduce the number of infections by being able to:
1) systematically identify all of those that have been in contact with someone
who has had COVID; and, 2) ensure those that have been exposed to the virus do
not unknowingly infect others. ""COVI"" is the name of a recent contact tracing
app developed by Mila and was proposed to help combat COVID-19 in Canada. The
app was designed to inform each individual of their relative risk of being
infected with the virus, which Mila claimed would empower citizens to make
informed decisions about their movement and allow for a data-driven approach to
public health policy; all the while ensuring data is safeguarded from
governments, companies, and individuals. This article will provide a critical
response to Mila's COVI White Paper. Specifically, this article will discuss:
the extent to which diversity has been considered in the design of the app,
assumptions surrounding users' interaction with the app and the app's utility,
as well as unanswered questions surrounding transparency, accountability, and
security. We see this as an opportunity to supplement the excellent risk
analysis done by the COVI team to surface insights that can be applied to other
contact- and proximity-tracing apps that are being developed and deployed
across the world. Our hope is that, through a meaningful dialogue, we can
ultimately help organizations develop better solutions that respect the
fundamental rights and values of the communities these solutions are meant to
serve.

forecasting. It is assumed that suitable transmission, epidemic and observation
models are available and previously validated and the transmission and epidemic
models are coded into a dynamical system. The observation model depends on the
dynamical system state variables and parameters, and is cast as a likelihood
function. We elicit prior distributions of the effective population size, the
dynamical system initial conditions and infectious contact rate, and use Markov
Chain Monte Carlo sampling to make inference and prediction of quantities of
interest (QoI) at the onset of the epidemic outbreak. The forecast is
sequentially updated over a sliding window of epidemic records as new data
becomes available. Prior distributions for the state variables at the new
forecasting time are assembled using the dynamical system, calibrated for the
previous forecast. Moreover, changes in the contact rate and effective
population size are naturally introduced through auto-regressive models on the
corresponding parameters. We show our forecasting method's performance using a
SEIR type model and COVID-19 data from several Mexican localities.

used, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from
healthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and

direction. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient
training samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this
end, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of
COVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use
contrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature
representations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the
prototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the
proposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly
available and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets. Our results demonstrate the
superior performance of our model for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 based

First, the structural features of such settings may lead to death.
Alternatively, it is possible that individuals in these facilities are in

have died even if they had not been in these facilities. Our findings show
that, controlling for the population density and the percentage of older adults
in the population, there is a significant positive association between the

  pandemic","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is challenging every part of society. From a
scientific point of view the first major task is to predict the dynamics of the
pandemic, allowing governments to allocate proper resources and measures to
fight it, as well as gauging the success of these measures by comparison with
the predictions in hindsight. The vast majority of pandemic models are based on
extensive models with large numbers of fit parameters, leading to individual
descriptions for every hot spot on the world. This makes predictions and
comparisons cumbersome, if not impossible. We here propose a different
approach, by moving away from a description over time, and instead choosing the
total number of infected people in an enclosed area as the independent
variable. Analyzing a few hot spots data, we derive an empirical formula for
the dynamics, dependent only on three variables. The final number of infections
is strictly connected to one fit parameter we call mitigation factor, which in
turn is mostly dependent only on the enclosed population. Despite its
simpleness, this description applies to every of the around 50 countries we
have analyzed, allows to separate different waves of the pandemic, provides a
figure of merit for the overall usefulness of government measures, and shows
when a pandemic is ending. Our model is robust against undetected cases, and
allows all nations, in particular those with fewer resources, to reasonably
predict the outcome of the pandemic in their country.

  studies in Europe","In December 2019, the first patients in Wuhan, China were diagnosed with a
primary atypical pneumonia, which showed to be unknown and contagious. Since
then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2,
has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the
crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The
results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for
improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform
beyond the current public health dogma called ""flatten-the-curve"". There are
several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases.
Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data,
these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in
the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that
epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that
assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19
pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other
and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the
simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen
whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures
taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the
quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that
countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates
in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a
good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing
the spread of COVID-19.

To improve the prediction of share price for aerospace industry sector and well

industries (manufacturer and operator). The experimental results show that PCA
could improve both accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Various factors could
influence the performance of prediction models, such as finance data, extracted

selection of features may depend on the stability of historical data: technical
features could be the first option when the share price is stable, whereas
fundamental features could be better when the share price has high fluctuation.
The delays of RNN also depend on the stability of historical data for different
types of companies. It would be more accurate through using short-term
historical data for aerospace manufacturers, whereas using long-term historical
data for aerospace operating airlines. The developed model could be an

  inhibitors from limonoids and triterpenoids for COVID-19","Virtual screening of phytochemicals was performed through molecular docking,
simulation, in silico ADMET and drug-likeness prediction to identify the
potential hits that can inhibit the effects of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the
published literature on medicinal importance, total 154 phytochemicals with
analogous structure from limonoids and triterpenoids were selected to search
potential inhibitors for the five therapeutic protein targets of SARS-CoV-2,
i.e., 3CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), SGp-RBD (spike
glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and
ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The in silico computational results
revealed that the phytochemicals such as glycyrrhizic acid, limonin,
7-deacetyl-7-benzoylgedunin, maslinic acid, corosolic acid, obacunone and
ursolic acid were found to be effective against the target proteins of
SARS-CoV-2. The protein-ligand interaction study revealed that these
phytochemicals bind with the amino acid residues at the active site of the
target proteins. Therefore, the core structure of these potential hits can be
used for further lead optimization to design drugs for SARS-CoV-2. Also, the
medicinal plants containing these phytochemicals like licorice, neem, tulsi,
citrus and olives can be used to formulate suitable therapeutic approaches in
traditional medicines.

reducing health risks. While these challenges can be mitigated through testing,
testing budget is often limited. Here we study how institutions, such as
nursing homes, should utilize a fixed test budget for early detection of an
outbreak. Using an extended network-SEIR model, we show that given a certain
budget of tests, it is generally better to test smaller subgroups of the
population frequently than to test larger groups but less frequently. The
numerical results are consistent with an analytical expression we derive for
the size of the outbreak at detection in an exponential spread model. Our work
provides a simple guideline for institutions: distribute your total tests over
several batches instead of using them all at once. We expect that in the
appropriate scenarios, this easy-to-implement policy recommendation will lead
to earlier detection and better mitigation of local COVID-19 outbreaks.

methods, reach, interactions, actors, and topics of the messages were examined,
as well as the use of fabricated news and conspiracy theories. The analysis
revealed that the alternative news media stay true to message patterns and
ideological foundations identified in prior research. While they do not spread
obvious lies, they are predominantly sharing overly critical, even
anti-systemic messages, opposing the view of the mainstream news media and the
political establishment. With this pandemic populism, they contribute to a
contradictory, menacing, and distrusting worldview, as portrayed in detail in

datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2

results suggest that the AI system generalizes to new patient populations and

represent an important step towards evaluating whether AI can be safely used to
flag cases in a general setting where previously unseen abnormalities exist.

contagion through timely, large-scale, coordinated, and decisive actions.
However, frequently the models used by experts [from whom decision-makers get
their main advice] focus on a single perspective [for example, the
epidemiological one] and do not consider many of the multiple forces that
affect the COVID-19 outbreak patterns. The epidemiological, socioeconomic, and
human mobility context of COVID-19 can be considered as a complex adaptive
system. So, these interventions (for example, lock-downs) could have many
and/or unexpected ramifications. This situation makes it difficult to
understand the overall effect produced by any public policy measure and,
therefore, to assess its real effectiveness and convenience. By using mobile
phone data, socioeconomic data, and COVID-19 cases data recorded throughout the
pandemic development, we aim to understand and explain [make sense of] the
observed heterogeneous regional patterns of contagion across time and space. We
will also consider the causal effects produced by confinement policies by

the spread through geographical scales and the impacts on different locations

municipalities. Contagion follows a stochastic compartmental model for
municipalities; the latter, in turn, interact with each other through recurrent
mobility. As a case of study, we consider the epidemic of COVID-19 in Brazil
performing data-driven simulations. Properties of the simulated epidemic curves
have very broad distributions across different geographical locations and
scales, from states, passing through intermediate and immediate regions down to
municipality levels. Correlations between delay of the epidemic outbreak and
distance from the respective capital cities were predicted to be strong in
several states and weak in others, signaling influences of multiple epidemic
foci propagating towards the inland cities. Responses of different regions to a
same mitigation protocol can vary enormously implying that the policies of
combating the epidemics must be engineered according to the region' specificity
but integrated with the overall situation. Real series of reported cases
confirm the qualitative scenarios predicted in simulations. Even though we

plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the
existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are
impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists
are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare
current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different
datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics.
Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in
this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based
on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas,
e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a
fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard
training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the
corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide
more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as
out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for
researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We
achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3\%, 97.7\%, and
67.3\% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6\%, 91.4\%, and

the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning
benchmark for medical image segmentation and the largest number of pre-trained

the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for

screening have gained significant traction in AI research since the start of
the coronavirus pandemic. Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19
screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical
setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected
model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of
experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for
COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures.
Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for
train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of
prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data
augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was
trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a
publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results
indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a
meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false
negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While
these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further
support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training
in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these
modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable
screening tool for COVID-19.

counterhate speech in mitigating the spread. Here we study the evolution and
spread of anti-Asian hate speech through the lens of Twitter. We create
COVID-HATE, the largest dataset of anti-Asian hate and counterhate spanning
three months, containing over 30 million tweets, and a social network with over
87 million nodes. By creating a novel hand-labeled dataset of 2,400 tweets, we
train a text classifier to identify hate and counterhate tweets that achieves
an average AUROC of 0.852. We identify 891,204 hate and 200,198 counterhate
tweets in COVID-HATE. Using this data to conduct longitudinal analysis, we find
that while hateful users are less engaged in the COVID-19 discussions prior to
their first anti-Asian tweet, they become more vocal and engaged afterwards
compared to counterhate users. We find that bots comprise 10.4% of hateful
users and are more vocal and hateful compared to non-bot users. Comparing bot
accounts, we show that hateful bots are more successful in attracting followers
compared to counterhate bots. Analysis of the social network reveals that
hateful and counterhate users interact and engage extensively with one another,
instead of living in isolated polarized communities. Furthermore, we find that
hate is contagious and nodes are highly likely to become hateful after being
exposed to hateful content. Importantly, our analysis reveals that counterhate
messages can discourage users from turning hateful in the first place. Overall,
this work presents a comprehensive overview of anti-Asian hate and counterhate

different options for implementation and evaluate performances. Our conceptual
deep-learning based Artificial Intelligence is able to achieve detection

phenomenon where a certain price-series lags behind and partially replicates
the movement of leading time-series. The present research proposes a new
technique which helps better identify the lead-lag relationship empirically.
Apart from better identifying the lead-lag path, the technique also gives a
measure for adjudging closeness between financial time-series. Also, the
proposed measure is closely related to correlation, and it uses Dynamic
Programming technique for finding the optimal lead-lag path. Further, it
retains most of the properties of a metric, so much so, it is termed as loose
metric. Tests are performed on Synthetic Time Series (STS) with known lead-lag
relationship and comparisons are done with other state-of-the-art models on the
basis of significance and forecastability. The proposed technique gives the
best results in both the tests. It finds paths which are all statistically
significant, and its forecasts are closest to the target values. Then, we use
the measure to study the topology evolution of the Foreign Exchange market, as
the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. Here, we study the FX currency prices of 29
prominent countries of the world. It is observed that as the crises unfold, all
the currencies become strongly interlinked to each other. Also, USA Dollar
starts playing even more central role in the FX market. Finally, we mention

  COVID-19 propagation","Raw data on the cumulative number of deaths at a country level generally
indicate a spatially variable distribution of the incidence of COVID-19
disease. An important issue is to determine whether this spatial pattern is a
consequence of environmental heterogeneities, such as the climatic conditions,
during the course of the outbreak. Another fundamental issue is to understand
the spatial spreading of COVID-19. To address these questions, we consider four
candidate epidemiological models with varying complexity in terms of initial
conditions, contact rates and non-local transmissions, and we fit them to
French mortality data with a mixed probabilistic-ODE approach. Using standard
statistical criteria, we select the model with non-local transmission
corresponding to a diffusion on the graph of counties that depends on the
geographic proximity, with time-dependent contact rate and spatially constant
parameters. This original spatially parsimonious model suggests that in a
geographically middle size centralized country such as France, once the
epidemic is established, the effect of global processes such as restriction
policies, sanitary measures and social distancing overwhelms the effect of
local factors. Additionally, this modeling approach reveals the latent
epidemiological dynamics including the local level of immunity, and allows us
to evaluate the role of non-local interactions on the future spread of the
disease. In view of its theoretical and numerical simplicity and its ability to
accurately track the COVID-19 epidemic curves, the framework we develop here,
in particular the non-local model and the associated estimation procedure, is
of general interest in studying spatial dynamics of epidemics.

pandemics like covid-19 require deep learning capabilities at mobile devices
(detect respiratory rate using mobile robotics or conduct CT scan using a
mobile scanner), which are severely constrained by the limited storage and
computation resources at the device level. To solve this problem, we propose a
three-tier architecture, including robot layers, edge layers, and cloud layers.
We adopt this architecture to design a non-contact respiratory monitoring
system to break down respiratory rate calculation tasks. Experimental results
of respiratory rate monitoring show that the proposed approach in this paper
significantly outperforms other approaches. It is supported by computation time
costs with 2.26 ms per frame, 27.48 ms per frame, 0.78 seconds for convolution
operation, similarity calculation, processing one-minute length respiratory
signals, respectively. And the computation time costs of our three-tier
architecture are less than that of edge+cloud architecture and cloud
architecture. Moreover, we use our three-tire architecture for CT image
diagnosis task decomposition. The evaluation of a CT image dataset of COVID-19
proves that our three-tire architecture is useful for resolving tasks on deep
learning networks by edge equipment. There are broad application scenarios in
smart hospitals in the future.

predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This
paper presents an approach that combines person-centric data-driven human
mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric
disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of disease
import, of changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility
data), of masks, of indoors vs.\ outdoors leisure activities, and of contact
tracing. Results show that the model is able to credibly track the infection
dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the
contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time.
The model clearly shows the effects of contact reductions, school
closures/vacations, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to
indoors in fall. Sensitivity tests show that all ingredients of the model are
necessary to track the current infection dynamics. One interesting result from
the mobility data is that behavioral changes of the population mostly happened
\textit{before} the government-initiated so-called contact ban came into
effect. Similarly, people started drifting back to their normal activity
patterns \emph{before} the government officially reduced the contact ban. Our
work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations
from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to
investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from
political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different
lockdown measures, consequences of wearing masks in certain situations, or
contact tracing.

bacterial pneumonia and 172 healthy controls), sampled from 64 videos. This
dataset was assembled from various online sources, processed specifically for
deep learning models and is intended to serve as a starting point for an
open-access initiative. Second, we train a deep convolutional neural network
(POCOVID-Net) on this 3-class dataset and achieve an accuracy of 89% and, by a
majority vote, a video accuracy of 92% . For detecting COVID-19 in particular,
the model performs with a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.79 and
F1-score of 0.92 in a 5-fold cross validation. Third, we provide an open-access
web service (POCOVIDScreen) that is available at: https://pocovidscreen.org.

maps, are critical inputs for a wide range of agriculture and food security
analyses and decisions. However, high-resolution cropland maps are not readily

have readily accessible ground truth data on croplands necessary for training

collecting labels for rapid response. We present a method for rapid mapping of
croplands in regions where little to no ground data is available. We present

  from 92 crystal structures","Currently, there is no effective antiviral drugs nor vaccine for coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Due to its high conservativeness and low similarity with human
genes, SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M$^{\text{pro}}$) is one of the most favorable
drug targets. However, the current understanding of the molecular mechanism of
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibition is limited by the lack of reliable binding affinity
ranking and prediction of existing structures of M$^{\text{pro}}$-inhibitor
complexes. This work integrates mathematics and deep learning (MathDL) to
provide a reliable ranking of the binding affinities of 92 SARS-CoV-2
M$^{\text{pro}}$ inhibitor structures. We reveal that Gly143 residue in
M$^{\text{pro}}$ is the most attractive site to form hydrogen bonds, followed
by Cys145, Glu166, and His163. We also identify 45 targeted covalent bonding
inhibitors. Validation on the PDBbind v2016 core set benchmark shows the MathDL
has achieved the top performance with Pearson's correlation coefficient ($R_p$)
being 0.858. Most importantly, MathDL is validated on a carefully curated
SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor dataset with the averaged $R_p$ as high as 0.751, which
endows the reliability of the present binding affinity prediction. The present
binding affinity ranking, interaction analysis, and fragment decomposition
offer a foundation for future drug discovery efforts.

essential weapons to combat the pandemic in the period of crisis. The lockdown
measure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on
our economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown
measures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and
epidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find
optimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during
the outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases
optimization problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximize the
overall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take
different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximize their
utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through
various additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model
people's behavior and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage
between economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results
provides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on
when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period
of the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID19
pandemic, it can be generalized to address similar problems to control the
outbreak of other infectious diseases with lockdown measures.

health and the world economy. One of the major challenges in controlling the
COVID-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission, which are
elusive and defenseless in most situations. The pathogenicity and virulence of
asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. Based on the genotyping of 20656
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome isolates,
we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T
mutation, i.e., leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) substitution at the residue 37
(L37F) of nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6). By analyzing the distribution of
11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the
hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the
11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders SARS-CoV-2
transmission capacity. Sequence alignment found both NSP6 and residue 37
neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species,
indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine
innate cellular defense against viral infection. Using machine learning and
topological data analysis, we demonstrate that mutation L37F has made NSP6
energetically less stable. The rigidity and flexibility index and several
network models suggest that mutation L37F may have compromised the NSP6
function, leading to a relatively weak SARS-CoV subtype. This assessment is a
good agreement with our genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission
across various countries and regions over the past few months.

  for COVID-19 Diagnosis","Purpose. Imaging plays an important role in assessing severity of COVID 19
pneumonia. However, semantic interpretation of chest radiography (CXR) findings
does not include quantitative description of radiographic opacities. Most
current AI assisted CXR image analysis framework do not quantify for regional
variations of disease. To address these, we proposed a four region lung
segmentation method to assist accurate quantification of COVID 19 pneumonia.
Methods. A segmentation model to separate left and right lung is firstly
applied, and then a carina and left hilum detection network is used, which are
the clinical landmarks to separate the upper and lower lungs. To improve the
segmentation performance of COVID 19 images, ensemble strategy incorporating
five models is exploited. Using each region, we evaluated the clinical
relevance of the proposed method with the Radiographic Assessment of the
Quality of Lung Edema (RALE). Results. The proposed ensemble strategy showed
dice score of 0.900, which is significantly higher than conventional methods
(0.854 0.889). Mean intensities of segmented four regions indicate positive
correlation to the extent and density scores of pulmonary opacities under the
RALE framework. Conclusion. A deep learning based model in CXR can accurately
segment and quantify regional distribution of pulmonary opacities in patients
with COVID 19 pneumonia.

  chest X-ray images to universal adversarial attacks","Under the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), chest
X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,
we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the
robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.

  patients reveals temporal evolution of distinctive coagulopathy signatures","Temporal inference from laboratory testing results and their triangulation
with clinical outcomes as described in the associated unstructured text from
the providers notes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is integral to
advancing precision medicine. Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg
patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a
two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing
dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation
and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma
fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of
patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these
measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with
declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower
and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented
curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events
after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet
reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal
trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19
associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes
longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural
network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR. This study
demonstrates how a precision medicine platform can help contextualize each
patients specific coagulation profile over time, towards the goal of informing
better personalization of thromboprophylaxis regimen.

actions taken to flatten the curve can be better quantified and understood.
This in turn can help the relevant authorities to better plan for and control
the subsequent waves of the pandemic. To achieve this, a deterministic

consideration the time-dependent characteristics of the model parameters,
especially on the ever-evolving value of the reproduction number, which is one

can then be estimated by fitting the model to real-world data using numerical
optimisation techniques or by inducing ad-hoc control actions as recorded in
the news platforms. In this paper, the model is verified using a case study
based on the data from the first wave of COVID-19 in the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The model is fitted to provide estimates for two settings in
simulations; time-invariant and time-varying (with bounded constraints)
parameters. Finally, some forecasts are made using four scenarios with

assumptions and are, therefore, prone to model misspecification errors. In this
paper, we develop an inferential method based on ideas from conformal
prediction, which can wrap around any survival prediction algorithm to produce
calibrated, covariate-dependent lower predictive bounds on survival times. In
the Type I right-censoring setting, when the censoring times are completely
exogenous, the lower predictive bounds have guaranteed coverage in finite
samples without any assumptions other than that of operating on independent and
identically distributed data points. Under a more general conditionally
independent censoring assumption, the bounds satisfy a doubly robust property
which states the following: marginal coverage is approximately guaranteed if
either the censoring mechanism or the conditional survival function is
estimated well. Further, we demonstrate that the lower predictive bounds remain
valid and informative for other types of censoring. The validity and efficiency
of our procedure are demonstrated on synthetic data and real COVID-19 data from
the UK Biobank.

sources. During the COVID-19 pandemic, observations of global NO$_2$ emissions
have shown significant decrease in urban areas. Drawing upon this example of
NO$_2$ as an industrial byproduct, we use a one-dimensional photochemical model
and synthetic spectral generator to assess the detectability of NO$_2$ as an
atmospheric technosignature on exoplanets. We consider cases of an Earth-like
planet around Sun-like, K-dwarf and M-dwarf stars. We find that NO$_2$
concentrations increase on planets around cooler stars due to less
short-wavelength photons that can photolyze NO$_2$. In cloud-free results,
present Earth-level NO$_2$ on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star at
10pc can be detected with SNR ~5 within ~400 hours with a 15 meter LUVOIR-like
telescope when observed in the 0.2 - 0.7micron range where NO$_2$ has a strong
absorption. However, clouds and aerosols can reduce the detectability and could
mimic the NO$_2$ feature. Historically, global NO$_2$ levels were 3x higher,
indicating the capability of detecting a 40-year old Earth-level civilization.
Transit and direct imaging observations to detect infrared spectral signatures
of NO$_2$ on habitable planets around M-dwarfs would need several 100s of hours
of observation time, both due to weaker NO$_2$ absorption in this region, and
also because of masking features by dominant H$_2$O and CO$_2$ bands in the
infrared part of the spectrum. Non-detection at these levels could be used to
place upper limits on the prevalence of NO$_2$ as a technosignature.

  drugs against COVID-19 selected key protein targets: An effort towards drug
  repurposing to identify the combination therapy to combat COVID-19","The emergence of COVID-19 has severely compromised the arsenal of antiviral
and antibiotic drugs. Drug discovery is a multistep process with a high failure
rate, high cost and it takes approximately 10-12 years for the development of
new molecules into the clinical candidate. On the other side, drug repurposing
also called old drugs for new uses, is an attractive alternative approach for a
new application of marketed FDA approved or investigational drugs. In the
current pandemic situation raised due to COVID-19, repurposing of existing FDA
approved drugs are emerging as the first line of the treatment. The causative
viral agent of this highly contagious disease and acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) shares high nucleotide similarity. Therefore, many
existing viral targets are structurally expected to be similar to SARS-CoV and
likely to be inhibited by the same compounds. Here, we selected three viral key
proteins based on their vital role in viral life cycle: ACE2 (helps in entry
into the human host), viral nonstructural proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) NSP12, and NSP16 which helps in replication, and viral latency (invasion
from immunity). The FDA approved drugs chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ), remdesivir (RDV) and arbidol (ABD) are emerging as promising agents to
combat COVID-19. Our hypothesis behind the docking studies is to determine the
binding affinities of these drugs and identify the key amino acid residues
playing a key role in their mechanism of action. The docking studies were
carried out through Autodock and online COVID-19 docking server. Further
studies on a broad range of FDA approved drugs including few more protein
targets, molecular dynamics studies, in-vitro and in-vivo biological evaluation
are required to identify the combination therapy targeting various stages of
the viral life cycle.

generated. In this work, we use a detailed set of mobility data to evaluate the
impact that these interventions had on alleviating the spread of the virus in
the US as measured through the COVID-19-related deaths. To establish this
impact, we use the notion of Granger causality between two time-series. We show
that there is a unidirectional Granger causality, from the median percentage of
time spent daily at home to the daily number of COVID-19-related deaths with a
lag of 2 weeks. We further analyze the mobility patterns at the census block
level to identify which parts of the population might encounter difficulties in
adhering and complying with social distancing measures. This information is
important, since it can consequently drive interventions that aim at helping
these parts of the population.

since the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 1918. So far, the disease due to the
SARS-CoV-2 virus has been countered with extreme measures at national level
that attempt to suppress epidemic growth. However, these approaches require
quick adoption and enforcement in order to effectively curb virus spread, and
may cause unprecedented socio-economic impact. A viable alternative to mass
surveillance and rule enforcement is harnessing collective intelligence by
means of citizen empowerment. Mobile applications running on personal devices
could significantly support this kind of approach by exploiting
context/location awareness and data collection capabilities. In particular,
technology-assisted location and contact tracing, if broadly adopted, may help
limit the spread of infectious diseases by raising end-user awareness and
enabling the adoption of selective quarantine measures. In this paper, we
outline general requirements and design principles of personal applications for
epidemic containment running on common smartphones, and we present a tool,

  Utilisation Predictions in New York State","Forecasting models have been influential in shaping decision-making in the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is concern that their predictions may have
been misleading. Here, we dissect the predictions made by four models for the
daily COVID-19 death counts between March 25 and June 5 in New York state, as
well as the predictions of ICU bed utilisation made by the influential IHME
model. We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the
uncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the ""ground
truth"" data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained.
Three different data sources were used by these models, and these had
substantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data
sources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For
accuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly. Only 10.2% of the
predictions fell within 10% of their training ground truth, irrespective of
distance into the future. For accurate assessment of uncertainty, only one
model matched relatively well the nominal 95% coverage, but that model did not
start predictions until April 16, thus had no impact on early, major decisions.
For ICU bed utilisation, the IHME model was highly inaccurate; the point
estimates only started to match ground truth after the pandemic wave had
started to wane. We conclude that trustworthy models require trustworthy input
data to be trained upon. Moreover, models need to be subjected to prespecified
real time performance tests, before their results are provided to policy makers
and public health officials.

social structures required for automated contact tracing to work. We display
the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequate sampling of the population,
which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact
with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a
significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold.
We conclude that relying largely on automated contact tracing without
population-wide participation to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
can be counterproductive and allow the pandemic to spread unchecked. The
simultaneous implementation of various mitigation methods along with automated
contact tracing is necessary for reaching an optimal solution to contain the

the go-to paradigm. However, the performance of such models is heavily

The creation of which is a heavily expensive and time consuming task, and

the virus SAR-COV-2 which continues to wreak havoc across the globe. The World
Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern. In Pakistan, the spread of the virus is on the rise
with the number of infected people and causalities rapidly increasing. In the
absence of proper vaccination and treatment, to reduce the number of infections
and casualties, the only option so far is to educate people regarding
preventive measures and to enforce countrywide lock-down. Any strategy about
the preventive measures needs to be based upon detailed analysis of the
COVID-19 outbreak and accurate scientific predictions. In this paper, we
conduct mathematical and numerical analysis to come up with reliable and
accurate predictions of the outbreak in Pakistan. The time-dependent
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model is used to fit the data and provide
future predictions. The turning point of the peak of the pandemic is defined as
the day when the transmission rate becomes less than the recovering rate. We
have predicted that the outbreak will reach its maximum peak occurring from
late May to 9 June with unrecovered number of Infectives in the range
20000-47000 and the cumulative number of infected cases in the range of
57500-153100. The number of Infectives will remain at the lower end in the
lock-down scenario but can rapidly double or triple if the spread of the

  co-attention network for early detection of COVID-19 fake tweets","Fake tweets are observed to be ever-increasing, demanding immediate
countermeasures to combat their spread. During COVID-19, tweets with
misinformation should be flagged and neutralized in their early stages to
mitigate the damages. Most of the existing methods for early detection of fake
news assume to have enough propagation information for large labeled tweets --
which may not be an ideal setting for cases like COVID-19 where both aspects
are largely absent. In this work, we present ENDEMIC, a novel early detection
model which leverages exogenous and endogenous signals related to tweets, while
learning on limited labeled data. We first develop a novel dataset, called CTF
for early COVID-19 Twitter fake news, with additional behavioral test sets to
validate early detection. We build a heterogeneous graph with
follower-followee, user-tweet, and tweet-retweet connections and train a graph
embedding model to aggregate propagation information. Graph embeddings and
contextual features constitute endogenous, while time-relative web-scraped
information constitutes exogenous signals. ENDEMIC is trained in a
semi-supervised fashion, overcoming the challenge of limited labeled data. We
propose a co-attention mechanism to fuse signal representations optimally.
Experimental results on ECTF, PolitiFact, and GossipCop show that ENDEMIC is
highly reliable in detecting early fake tweets, outperforming nine
state-of-the-art methods significantly.

simulate the pandemic dynamics using a society of agents emulating people,

interventions were analyzed, with varying epidemiological and economic effects:
(1) do nothing, (2) lockdown, (3) conditional lockdown, (4) vertical isolation,
(5) partial isolation, (6) use of face masks, and (7) use of face masks
together with 50% of adhesion to social isolation. In the impossibility of
implementing scenarios with lockdown, which present the lowest number of deaths
and highest impact on the economy, scenarios combining the use of face masks
and partial isolation can be the more realistic for implementation in terms of
social cooperation. The COVID-ABS model was implemented in Python programming
language, with source code publicly available. The model can be easily extended
to other societies by changing the input parameters, as well as allowing the
creation of a multitude of other scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to

(COVID-19) causes the pneumonia-like effect in the lungs, the examination of
chest x-rays can help to diagnose the diseases. For automatic analysis of
images, they are represented in machines by a set of semantic features. Deep
Learning (DL) models are widely used to extract features from images. General
deep features may not be appropriate to represent chest x-rays as they have a
few semantic regions. Though the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) based features are
shown to be more appropriate for x-ray type of images, existing BoVW features
may not capture enough information to differentiate COVID-19 infection from
other pneumonia-related infections. In this paper, we propose a new BoVW method
over deep features, called Bag of Deep Visual Words (BoDVW), by removing the
feature map normalization step and adding deep features normalization step on
the raw feature maps. This helps to preserve the semantics of each feature map
that may have important clues to differentiate COVID-19 from pneumonia. We
evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed BoDVW features in chest x-rays
classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to diagnose COVID-19. Our
results on a publicly available COVID-19 x-ray dataset reveal that our features
produce stable and prominent classification accuracy, particularly
differentiating COVID-19 infection from other pneumonia, in shorter computation
time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Thus, our method could be a very
useful tool for quick diagnosis of COVID-19 patients on a large scale.

  Jobs Crisis in Australia from 2012 to 2020","In Australia and beyond, journalism is reportedly an industry in crisis, a
crisis exacerbated by COVID-19. However, the evidence revealing the crisis is
often anecdotal or limited in scope. In this unprecedented longitudinal
research, we draw on data from the Australian journalism jobs market from
January 2012 until March 2020. Using Data Science and Machine Learning
techniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data
comprising 3,698 journalist job ads from a corpus of over 8 million Australian
job ads; and official employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
Having matched and analysed both sources, we address both the demand for and
supply of journalists in Australia over this critical period. The data show
that the crisis is real, but there are also surprises. Counter-intuitively, the
number of journalism job ads in Australia rose from 2012 until 2016, before
falling into decline. Less surprisingly, for the entire period studied the
figures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large and erratic
fluctuations. The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has significantly
worsened the crisis. We then tease out more granular findings, including: that
there are now more women than men journalists in Australia, but that gender
inequity is worsening, with women journalists getting younger and worse-paid
just as men journalists are, on average, getting older and better-paid; that,
despite the crisis besetting the industry, the demand for journalism skills has
increased; and that, perhaps concerningly, the skills sought by journalism job
ads increasingly include social media and generalist communications.

  Universal Sentence Encoder","The novel corona-virus disease (also known as COVID-19) has led to a
pandemic, impacting more than 200 countries across the globe. With its global
impact, COVID-19 has become a major concern of people almost everywhere, and
therefore there are a large number of tweets coming out from every corner of
the world, about COVID-19 related topics. In this work, we try to analyze the
tweets and detect the trending topics and major concerns of people on Twitter,
which can enable us to better understand the situation, and devise better
planning. More specifically we propose a model based on the universal sentence
encoder to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. We used universal
sentence encoder in order to derive the semantic representation and the
similarity of tweets. We then used the sentence similarity and their
embeddings, and feed them to K-means clustering algorithm to group similar
tweets (in semantic sense). After that, the cluster summary is obtained using a
text summarization algorithm based on deep learning, which can uncover the
underlying topics of each cluster. Through experimental results, we show that
our model can detect very informative topics, by processing a large number of
tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the
tweets). Since this framework has no restriction on specific data distribution,
it can be used to detect trending topics from any other social media and any
other context rather than COVID-19. Experimental results show superiority of
our proposed approach to other baselines, including TF-IDF, and latent
Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

to play a key role. Given the difficulties with other data sources, we provide
a crude alternative analysis based on the Diamond Princess Cruise ship data and

clinical science, and with it the possibility that data could be shared, to
multiply insights beyond what investigators could abstract from paper records.
The need to share individual-level medical data to accelerate innovation in
precision medicine continues to grow, and has never been more urgent, as
scientists grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, enthusiasm for the use
of big data has been tempered by a fully appropriate concern for patient
autonomy and privacy. That is, the ability to extract private or confidential
information about an individual, in practice, renders it difficult to share
data, since significant infrastructure and data governance must be established
before data can be shared. Although HIPAA provided de-identification as an
approved mechanism for data sharing, linkage attacks were identified as a major
vulnerability. A variety of mechanisms have been established to avoid leaking
private information, such as field suppression or abstraction, strictly
limiting the amount of information that can be shared, or employing
mathematical techniques such as differential privacy. Another approach, which
we focus on here, is creating synthetic data that mimics the underlying data.
For synthetic data to be a useful mechanism in support of medical innovation
and a proxy for real-world evidence, one must demonstrate two properties of the
synthetic dataset: (1) any analysis on the real data must be matched by
analysis of the synthetic data (statistical fidelity) and (2) the synthetic
data must preserve privacy, with minimal risk of re-identification (privacy
guarantee). In this paper we propose a framework for quantifying the
statistical fidelity and privacy preservation properties of synthetic datasets
and demonstrate these metrics for synthetic data generated by Syntegra
technology.

another through social contact networks. In today's interconnected global
society, such contagion processes can cause global public health hazards, as
exemplified by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore of great
practical relevance to investigate the network trans-mission of contagious
diseases from the perspective of statistical inference. An important and widely
studied boundary condition for contagion processes over networks is the
so-called epidemic threshold. The epidemic threshold plays a key role in
determining whether a pathogen introduced into a social contact network will
cause an epidemic or die out. In this paper, we investigate epidemic thresholds
from the perspective of statistical network inference. We identify two major
challenges that are caused by high computational and sampling complexity of the
epidemic threshold. We develop two statistically accurate and computationally
efficient approximation techniques to address these issues under the Chung-Lu
modeling framework. The second approximation, which is based on random walk
sampling, further enjoys the advantage of requiring data on a vanishingly small
fraction of nodes. We establish theoretical guarantees for both methods and
demonstrate their empirical superiority.

surprisingly abrupt phase transitions. Despite the complex behaviors of the
mobility network, we devised a novel approach to identify a small, manageable
set of recurrent critical bridges, connecting the giant component and the
second-largest component. These adaptive links, located across the United
States, played a key role as valves connecting components in divisions and
regions during the pandemic. Beyond, our numerical results unveil that network
characteristics determine the critical thresholds and the bridge locations. The
findings provide new insights into managing and controlling the connectivity of

interconnectivity between stock returns, building weighted signed networks for
the stocks of seven European countries, the US and Japan. We establish the
theoretical relationship between the level of balance in a network and stock
predictability, studying its evolution from 2005 to the third quarter of 2020.
We find a clear balance-unbalance transition for six of the nine countries,
following the August 2011 Black Monday in the US, when the Economic Policy
Uncertainty index for this country reached its highest monthly level before the
COVID-19 crisis. This sudden loss of balance is mainly caused by a
reorganization of the market networks triggered by a group of low
capitalization stocks belonging to the non-financial sector. After the
transition, the stocks of companies in these groups become all negatively
correlated between them and with most of the rest of the stocks in the market.
The implied change in the network topology is directly related to a decrease in
stocks predictability, a finding with novel important implications for asset
allocation and portfolio hedging strategies.

  review","The emergence of COVID-19 has necessitated many efforts by the scientific
community for its proper management. An urgent clinical reaction is required in
the face of the unending devastation being caused by the pandemic. These
efforts include technological innovations for improvement in screening,
treatment, vaccine development, contact tracing and, survival prediction. The
use of Deep Learning (DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be sought in all
of the above-mentioned spheres. This paper aims to review the role of Deep
Learning and Artificial intelligence in various aspects of the overall COVID-19
management and particularly for COVID-19 detection and classification. The DL
models are developed to analyze clinical modalities like CT scans and X-Ray
images of patients and predict their pathological condition. A DL model aims to
detect the COVID-19 pneumonia, classify and distinguish between COVID-19,
Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP), Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and normal
conditions. Furthermore, sophisticated models can be built to segment the
affected area in the lungs and quantify the infection volume for a better
understanding of the extent of damage. Many models have been developed either
independently or with the help of pre-trained models like VGG19, ResNet50, and
AlexNet leveraging the concept of transfer learning. Apart from model
development, data preprocessing and augmentation are also performed to cope
with the challenge of insufficient data samples often encountered in medical
applications. It can be evaluated that DL and AI can be effectively implemented

  Telehealth Photos","Telehealth is an increasingly critical component of the health care
ecosystem, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid adoption of
telehealth has exposed limitations in the existing infrastructure. In this
paper, we study and highlight photo quality as a major challenge in the
telehealth workflow. We focus on teledermatology, where photo quality is
particularly important; the framework proposed here can be generalized to other
health domains. For telemedicine, dermatologists request that patients submit
images of their lesions for assessment. However, these images are often of
insufficient quality to make a clinical diagnosis since patients do not have
experience taking clinical photos. A clinician has to manually triage poor
quality images and request new images to be submitted, leading to wasted time
for both the clinician and the patient. We propose an automated image
assessment machine learning pipeline, TrueImage, to detect poor quality
dermatology photos and to guide patients in taking better photos. Our
experiments indicate that TrueImage can reject 50% of the sub-par quality
images, while retaining 80% of good quality images patients send in, despite
heterogeneity and limitations in the training data. These promising results
suggest that our solution is feasible and can improve the quality of
teledermatology care.

  Electronic Health Record Data","Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has been of tremendous utility in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare such as predicting future clinical
events. These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using
classical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class
imbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To
address some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting
contrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized
clinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially
augment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the
similar/dissimilar patterns (by its ""push-and-pull"" form), meanwhile mitigating
the highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces
(as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the
contrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive
samples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data.
To this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies
specifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that
exploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature
learning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates
pre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both
sampling approaches are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class
variance in EHR data. Our overall framework yields highly competitive
experimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world COVID-19
EHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health
system. Specifically, our method reaches a high AUROC prediction score of
0.959, which outperforms other baselines and alternatives: cross-entropy(0.873)
and focal loss(0.931).

understand how changes in economic activity and traffic affect ambient air

pollution reduction over the lockdown period by using the measurements from
ground air pollution monitoring stations, training a long-term prediction model
and comparing its predictions to measured values over the lockdown month.We
show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the data from air

-34.7 % in NO2 / PM2.5 in Beijing and Wuhan respectively. Our reduction
estimates are consistent with recent publications, yet in contrast to prior
works, our method takes local weather into account. What can we learn from
pollution emissions during lockdown? The lockdown period was too short to train
meaningful models from scratch. To tackle this problem, we use transfer
learning to newly fit only traffic-dependent variables. We show that the
resulting models are accurate, suitable for an analysis of the post-lockdown
period and capable of estimating the future air pollution reduction potential.

psychometric impact and coupling of the COVID-19 infodemic with the official
bulletins related to COVID-19 at the national and state level in India. We look
at these two sources with a psycho-linguistic lens of emotions and quantified
the extent and coupling between the two. We modified path, a deep skip-gram
based open-sourced lexicon builder for effective capture of health-related
emotions. We were then able to capture the time-evolution of health-related
emotions in social media and official bulletins. An analysis of lead-lag

the horizontal and longitudinal effects of stringent interventions implemented
in Wenzhou, a representative urban city of China, where stringent interventions
were enforced to curb its own epidemic situation with rapidly increasing newly
confirmed cases. We found that there were statistically significant treatment
effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed
cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if
the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were
implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would
have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of
stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of
COVID-19. The slower the interventions were implemented, the more severe the

  Interactions","Motivation: Exploring drug-protein interactions (DPIs) work as a pivotal step
in drug discovery. The fast expansion of available biological data enables
computational methods effectively assist in experimental methods. Among them,
deep learning methods extract features only from basic characteristics, such as
protein sequences, molecule structures. Others achieve significant improvement
by learning from not only sequences/molecules but the protein-protein and
drug-drug associations (PPAs and DDAs). The PPAs and DDAs are generally
obtained by using computational methods. However, existing computational
methods have some limitations, resulting in low-quality PPAs and DDAs that
hamper the prediction performance. Therefore, we hope to develop a novel
supervised learning method to learn the PPAs and DDAs effectively and thereby
improve the prediction performance of the specific task of DPI. Results: In
this research, we propose a novel deep learning framework, namely BridgeDPI.
BridgeDPI introduces a class of nodes named hyper-nodes, which bridge different
proteins/drugs to work as PPAs and DDAs. The hyper-nodes can be supervised
learned for the specific task of DPI since the whole process is an end-to-end
learning. Consequently, such a model would improve prediction performance of
DPI. In three real-world datasets, we further demonstrate that BridgeDPI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ablation studies verify the
effectiveness of the hyper-nodes. Last, in an independent verification,
BridgeDPI explores the candidate bindings among COVID-19's proteins and various
antiviral drugs. And the predictive results accord with the statement of the
World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration, showing the
validity and reliability of BridgeDPI.

  Program be Effective?","Since the end of 2019, COVID-19 has significantly affected the lives of
people around the world. Towards the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccine
candidates with relatively high efficacy have been reported in the final phase
of clinical trials. Vaccines have been considered as critical tools for opening
up social and economic activities, thereby lessening the impact of this disease
on the society. This paper presents a simulation of COVID-19 spread using
modified Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model under vaccine intervention in
several localities of Malaysia, i.e. those cities or states with high
relatively COVID-19 cases such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sabah, and Sarawak. The
results show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85, and 0.95),
the curves of active infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines with
efficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd immunity required to level the
curves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing or not
implementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that lowering
the reproduction number, R0 is necessary to keep the infection curve flat
despite vaccination. This is due to the assumption that vaccination is mostly
carried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is based on our
simulation results with two values of R0: 1.1 and 1.2, indicative of reduction
of R0 by social distancing. The lower R0 shows a smaller peak amplitude about
half the value simulated with R0=1.2. In conclusion, the simulation model
suggests a two-pronged strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia:
vaccination and compliance with standard operating procedure issued by the
World Health Organization (e.g. social distancing).

mandatory part of complex dynamic systems such as security checkpoints,

transmission requires not only the state and federal level order of protective
measures such as social distancing and testing, but also public awareness of
time-dependent risk and reactions at county and community levels. We propose a
robust approach to estimate the heterogeneous progression of SARS-CoV-2 at all
US counties having no less than 2 COVID-19 associated deaths, and we use the
daily probability of contracting (PoC) SARS-CoV-2 for a susceptible individual
to quantify the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a community. We found that
shortening by $5\%$ of the infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 can reduce around
$39\%$ (or $78$K, $95\%$ CI: $[66$K $, 89$K $]$) of the COVID-19 associated
deaths in the US as of 20 September 2020. Our findings also indicate that
reducing infection and deaths by a shortened infectious period is more
pronounced for areas with the effective reproduction number close to 1,
suggesting that testing should be used along with other mitigation measures,
such as social distancing and facial mask-wearing, to reduce the transmission
rate. Our deliverable includes a dynamic county-level map for local officials
to determine optimal policy responses and for the public to better understand
the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 on each day.

COVID-19 pandemic via social distancing measures based on the example of
Germany. Our goal is to minimize the number of fatalities over the course of
two years without inducing excessive social costs. We consider a tailored model
of the German COVID-19 outbreak with different parameter sets to design and
validate our approach. Our analysis reveals that an open-loop optimal control
policy can significantly decrease the number of fatalities when compared to
simpler policies under the assumption of exact model knowledge. In a more
realistic scenario with uncertain data and model mismatch, a feedback strategy
that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a
reliable performance, even when applied to a validation model with deviant
parameters. On top of that, we propose a robust MPC-based feedback policy using
interval arithmetic that adapts the social distancing measures cautiously and
safely, thus leading to a minimum number of fatalities even if measurements are
inaccurate and the infection rates cannot be precisely specified by social
distancing. Our theoretical findings support various recent studies by showing
that 1) adaptive feedback strategies are required to reliably contain the
COVID-19 outbreak, 2) well-designed policies can significantly reduce the
number of fatalities compared to simpler ones while keeping the amount of
social distancing measures on the same level, and 3) imposing stronger social
distancing measures early on is more effective and cheaper in the long run than
opening up too soon and restoring stricter measures at a later time.

us to understand what really happen in these places if we can detect the

traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure
and immunity tests. Our micro-level model keeps track of the infection state
for each individual at every point in time, ranging from susceptible, exposed,

contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm
uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each
individual over the entire time period of analysis, given the latent infection

orders such as the national emergency declaration on March 13, as well as how
fast they started changing their behavior after the regulations were imposed.
For this purpose, we calculated the behavior changes of people in different
mobility metrics, such as percentage of people staying home during the study
period (March, April, and May 2020), in different age groups in comparison to
the days before the pandemic (January and February 2020), by utilizing
anonymized and privacy-protected mobile device data. Our study indicates that
senior communities outperformed younger communities in terms of their behavior
change. Senior communities not only had a faster response to the outbreak in
comparison to young communities, they also had better performance consistency
during the pandemic.

Using several nationally representative datasets in Colombia, this article
documents how the academic performance of students in their final high school

that internet access strongly affects these results, and little improvement on
the internet/computer access will reflect better academic performance. Under
these conditions, belonging to an ethnic group or high rurality (non-geographic
centralized municipalities) has a negative impact. Policy implications are

the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken,
followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The
public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus
new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and

COVID-19 pandemic. It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers'
likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats.
However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that
the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the
clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and
take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes
lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the
reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding
processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using
pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show
that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared
with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a
typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping
middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show
that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this
case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises
from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Our
results suggest that airlines either revert to their earlier boarding process
or adopt the better random process.

  Transfer Learning","The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major outbreak in more than 150 countries
around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people
globally. One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect
the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting
this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the
fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed
specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with
COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning
models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We
first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available
datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by
board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms
was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including
ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease
in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining
3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98%
($\pm$ 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity
and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix
of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions
potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain
most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While
the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a
larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy

  Study of Baidu During COVID-19 Pandemic","Nowadays, working from home (WFH) has become a popular work arrangement due
to its many potential benefits for both companies and employees (e.g.,
increasing job satisfaction and retention of employees). Many previous studies
have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of
employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis
method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work
from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to
work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working
from home affects their productivity.
  In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity
between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative
analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one
of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four
thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of
these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due
to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts
on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of
builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has
different impacts on projects with different characteristics including
programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has
a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally,
we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these
findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some
reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.

  Heterogeneity and Lockdowns on Herd Immunity","Recently, [8] has proposed that heterogeneity of infectiousness (and
susceptibility) across individuals in infectious diseases, plays a major role
in affecting the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT). Such heterogeneity has been
observed in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdispersion (or
""super-spreading""). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute
significantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely
to get infected and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R_0 = 3
(attributed to COVID-19), the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in
contrast to 67% according to the traditional models [1, 2, 4, 10]. This work
follows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness
(susceptibility) has two ""faces"" whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1)
Personal-Trait-, and (2) Event-Based- Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The
former is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is
nullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The latter is
event-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective
throughout the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]'s
model to account for these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is
very sensitive to the mix between (1) and (2), and under R_0 = 3 it can vary
between 5% and 67%. Preliminary data from COVID-19 suggests that herd immunity
is not reached at 5%. We address operational aspects and analyze the effects of
lockdown strategies on the spread of a disease. We find that herd immunity (and
HIT) is very sensitive to the lockdown type. While some lockdowns affect
positively the disease blocking and increase herd immunity, others have adverse
effects and reduce the herd immunity.

short texts do not offer as adequate insights into psychological processes as
longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics

severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy

  Analysis","The Covid-19 pandemic caused disruptive effects for individuals, firms, and
societies. In this paper, we offer insights on the major issues and challenges
firms are facing in the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as their concerns for
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) themes. To do so, we investigate large
Italian firms' discussion on Twitter in the first nine months of the pandemic.
We downloaded all Twitter posts from 1st of March, 2020, to 17th of November,
2020 by the accounts of the largest Italian firms, i.e. those with 250 or more
employees. We then built the bipartite network of accounts and hashtags and,
using an entropy-based null model as a benchmark, we projected the information
contained in the network into the accounts layers, identifying a network of
accounts in which a link indicates a non trivial similarity in terms of their
usage of hashtags. We find that the conversation is focused around 13
communities, 10 of which include Covid-19 themes. The core of the network is
formed of 5 communities, which deal with environmental sustainability, digital
innovation and safety. Firms' ownership type does not seem to influence the
conversation. 10 communities out of 13 mention hashtags related to CSR, with
the environmental and social dimensions as the prevalent ones. Interestingly
enough, the social dimension seems more relevant in the communities dealing
with digital innovation and safety. However, the relevance of CSR hashtags is
very small at the single message level, but with some peculiarities arising in
specific communities. Overall, our paper highlights the role of network methods
on Twitter data as a tool which can support managers and policy makers to
design their strategies and decision making, capturing firms' emerging issues
and relevant themes.

  Prevention Strategies","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 spreading, the number of studies on the
epidemic models increased dramatically. It is important for policy makers to
know how the disease will spread, and what are the effects of the policies and
environment on the spreading. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the
standard infectious disease models: (a) We consider the prevention measures
adopted based on the current severity of the infection, those measures are
adaptive and change over time. (b) Multiple cities and regions are considered,
with population movements between those cities/regions, while taking into
account that each region may have different prevention measures. While the
adaptive measures and mobility of the population were often observed during the
pandemic, these effects are rarely explicitly modeled and studied in the
classical epidemic models. The model we propose gives rise to a plateau
phenomenon: the number of people infected by the disease stay at the same level
during an extended period of time. We show what are conditions needs to be met
in order for the spreading to exhibit a plateau period, and we show that this
phenomenon is interdependent: when considering multiples cities, the conditions
are different from a single city. We verify from the real-world data that
plateau phenomenon does exists in many regions of the world in the current
COVID-19 development. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis on the plateau
phenomenon for the single-city model, and derive a series of results on the
emergence and ending of the plateau, and on the height and length of the
plateau. Our theoretical results match well with our empirical findings.

particularly challenging to understand: (i) the great geographical differences
in the degree of virus contagiousness and lethality which were found in the
different phases of the epidemic progression, and (ii) the potential role of
the infected people's blood type in both the virus infectivity and the
progression of the disease. A recent hypothesis could shed some light on both
aspects. Specifically, it has been proposed that in the subject-to-subject
transfer SARS-CoV-2 conserves on its capsid the erythrocytes' antigens of the
source subject. Thus these conserved antigens can potentially cause an immune
reaction in a receiving subject that has previously acquired specific
antibodies for the source subject antigens. This hypothesis implies a blood
type-dependent infection rate. The strong geographical dependence of the blood
type distribution could be, therefore, one of the factors at the origin of the
observed heterogeneity in the epidemics spread. Here, we present an
epidemiological deterministic model where the infection rules based on blood
types are taken into account and compare our model outcomes with the exiting
worldwide infection progression data. We found an overall good agreement, which
strengthens the hypothesis that blood types do play a role in the COVID-19
infection.

  interventions using compartment models: the PyRoss library","PyRoss is an open-source Python library that offers an integrated platform
for inference, prediction and optimisation of NPIs in age- and
contact-structured epidemiological compartment models. This report outlines the
rationale and functionality of the PyRoss library, with various illustrations
and examples focusing on well-mixed, age-structured populations. The PyRoss
library supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as
master equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run
transitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental
subdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and
allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and
forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as
available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be
weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact
of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological
data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to
optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are
included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed
populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments
structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes
relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such
compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be
combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,
could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to
detailed epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for
research to address today's COVID-19 crisis, and to plan for future pandemics.

tremendous pressure on the medical system. Imaging plays a complementary role
in the management of patients with COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) and chest
X-ray (CXR) are the two dominant screening tools. However, difficulty in
eliminating the risk of disease transmission, radiation exposure and not being
costeffective are some of the challenges for CT and CXR imaging. This fact
induces the implementation of lung ultrasound (LUS) for evaluating COVID-19 due
to its practical advantages of noninvasiveness, repeatability, and sensitive
bedside property. In this paper, we utilize a deep learning model to perform
the classification of COVID-19 from LUS data, which could produce objective
diagnostic information for clinicians. Specifically, all LUS images are
processed to obtain their corresponding local phase filtered images and radial
symmetry transformed images before fed into the multi-scale residual
convolutional neural network (CNN). Secondly, image combination as the input of
the network is used to explore rich and reliable features. Feature fusion
strategy at different levels is adopted to investigate the relationship between
the depth of feature aggregation and the classification accuracy. Our proposed

  matter","I critique a recent analysis (Miles, Stedman & Heald, 2020) of COVID-19
lockdown costs and benefits, focussing on the United Kingdom (UK). Miles et al.
(2020) argue that the March-June UK lockdown was more costly than the benefit
of lives saved, evaluated using the NICE threshold of {\pounds}30000 for a
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and that the costs of a lockdown for 13 weeks
from mid-June would be vastly greater than any plausible estimate of the
benefits, even if easing produced a second infection wave causing over 7000
deaths weekly by mid-September.
  I note here two key problems that significantly affect their estimates and
cast doubt on their conclusions. Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut
off after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they
assume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths
and corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes
that (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or
social interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary
lockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under
these assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of
serious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for
survivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in
deaths.
  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without
estimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness
costs. More work on modelling these uncertainties is urgently needed.

  through an agent-based approach","Mobility restriction is considered one of the main policies to contain
COVID-10 spreading. However, there are multiple ways to reduce mobility via
differentiated restrictions, and it is not easy to predict the actual impact on
virus spreading. This is a limitation for policy-makers who need to implement
effective and timely measures. Notwithstanding the big role of data analysis to
understand this phenomenon, it is also important to have more general models
capable of predicting the impact of different scenarios. Besides, they should
be able to simulate scenarios in a disaggregated way, so to understand the
possible impact of targeted strategies, e.g. on a geographical scale or in
relation to other variables associated with the potential risk of infection.
This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) able to dynamically simulate the
COVID-19 spreading under different mobility restriction scenarios. The model
uses the Italian case study with its 20 administrative regions and considers
parameters that can be attributed to the diffusion and lethality of the virus
(based on a virus spread risk model) and population mobility patterns. The
model is calibrated with real data and reproduces the impact that different
mobility restrictions can have on the pandemic diffusion based on a combination
of static and dynamic parameters. Results suggest that virus spreading would
have been similar if differentiated mobility restriction strategies based on
a-priori risk parameters instead of a national lockdown would have been put in
place in Italy during the first wave of the pandemic. The proposed model could
give useful suggestions for decision-makers to tackle pandemics and virus
spreading at a strategic level.

issues to discuss and share information with each other. In late December 2019,
an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (infection from which results in the disease
named COVID-19) was reported, and, due to the rapid spread of the virus in
other parts of the world, the World Health Organization declared a state of
emergency. In this paper, we used automated extraction of COVID-19 related
discussions from social media and a natural language process (NLP) method based
on topic modeling to uncover various issues related to COVID-19 from public
opinions. Moreover, we also investigate how to use LSTM recurrent neural
network for sentiment classification of COVID-19 comments. Our findings shed
light on the importance of using public opinions and suitable computational
techniques to understand issues surrounding COVID-19 and to guide related
decision-making.

large and persistent differences in mobility reduction between wealth groups:
on average, users in the top decile of wealth reduced their mobility up to

  COVID-19","To capture the death rates and strong weekly, biweekly and probably monthly
patterns in the Canada COVID-19, we utilize the generalized additive models in
the absence of direct statistically based measurement of infection rates. By
examining the death rates of Canada in general and Quebec, Ontario and Alberta
in particular, one can easily figured out that there are substantial
overdispersion relative to the Poisson so that the negative binomial
distribution is an appropriate choice for the analysis. Generalized additive
models (GAMs) are one of the main modeling tools for data analysis. GAMs can
efficiently combine different types of fixed, random and smooth terms in the
linear predictor of a regression model to account for different types of
effects. GAMs are a semi-parametric extension of the generalized linear models
(GLMs), used often for the case when there is no a priori reason for choosing a
particular response function such as linear, quadratic, etc. and need the data
to 'speak for themselves'. GAMs do this via the smoothing functions and take
each predictor variable in the model and separate it into sections delimited by
'knots', and then fit polynomial functions to each section separately, with the
constraint that there are no links at the knots - second derivatives of the
separate functions are equal at the knots.

exponential growth, with the number of cases quite well fit in time by

days, capturing thus the early growth homogeneously. We look for a link between
$\alpha$ and the average temperature $T$ of each country, in the month of the
epidemic growth. We analyze a {\it base} set of 42 countries, which developed
the epidemic earlier, an {\it intermediate} set of 88 countries and an {\it
extended} set of 125 countries, which developed the epidemic more recently.
Applying a linear fit $\alpha(T)$, we find increasing evidence for a decreasing
$\alpha$ as a function of $T$, at $99.66\%$C.L., $99.86\%$C.L. and $99.99995

Specifically, we present a dual-consistency learning scheme that simultaneously
imposes image transformation equivalence and feature perturbation invariance to

the epistemic uncertainty and the aleatoric uncertainty and employ them
together to guide the consistency regularization for more reliable unsupervised
learning. Extensive experiments showed that our proposed UDC-Net improves the

semi-supervised approaches by significant margins, demonstrating high potential
in real-world clinical practice.

surveillance. Spatio-temporal disease mapping models, which allow dealing with
highly disaggregated spatial and temporal units of analysis, are a priority in
this sense. Spatio-temporal models provide a geographically detailed and
temporally updated overview of the current state of the pandemics, making
public health interventions to be more effective. Moreover, the use of
spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context,
facilitates estimating newly demanded epidemiological indicators, such as the
instantaneous reproduction number (R_t), even for small areas. This, in turn,
allows to adapt traditional disease mapping models to these new circumstancies

  In this paper we propose a new spatio-temporal disease mapping model,
particularly suited to Covid-19 surveillance. As an additional result, we
derive instantaneous reproduction number estimates for small areas, enabling
monitoring this parameter with a high spatial disaggregation. We illustrate the
use of our proposal with the separate study of the disease pandemics in two
Spanish regions. As a result, we illustrate how touristic flows could haved
shaped the spatial distribution of the disease. In these real studies, we also
propose new surveillance tools that can be used by regional public health

economic and social impacts by preventing their parents from returning to work.
Data on Covid-19 in children are sparse and policy frameworks are evolving
quickly. We compare a set of potential policies to accompany the reopening of
schools by means of an agent-based simulation tool. The policies and scenarios
we model reflect the public discussion and government guidelines in early March
2021 in England before the planned nationwide reopening of schools on the 8th
of March. A point of particular interest is the potential contribution of a
more wide-spread use of screening tests based on lateral flow devices. We
compare policies both with respect to their potential to contain new outbreaks
of Covid-19 in schools and the proportion of schooldays lost due to isolation
of pupils. We find that regular asymptomatic screening of the whole school as
an addition to a policy built around isolation of symptomatic pupils and their
closest contacts is beneficial across a wide range of scenarios, including when
screening tests with relatively low test sensitivity are used. Multiple
screening tests per week bring only small additional benefits in some
scenarios. These findings remain valid when test compliance is not enforced

multiplicity of scientific disciplines. The dynamics emerging from infodemics
have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns. In order to react
appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and
Economics to understand the dynamics emerging from it. In the short run,
dynamics might lead to an adaptation in household spending or to a shift in
buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run, changes in
investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that
the dynamics emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as
information and misinformation accessible for individuals and the formation and

others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized

derived from a superior modality (CT) serving as ground truth, projected onto

network to quantify airspace disease on paired CXRs; and 2) compare the

  Materials and Methods: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19
patients (with positive RT-PCR), from March-May 2020 at a tertiary hospital in
the northeastern USA, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hrs. The ground
truth volumetric percentage of COVID-19 related AD (POv) was established by
manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3D masks were projected into 2D
anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to compute
area-based AD percentage (POa). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was
trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19

POa on CXR. CNN POa results were compared to POa quantified on CXR by two
expert readers and to the POv ground-truth, by computing correlations and mean
absolute errors.
  Results: Bootstrap mean absolute error (MAE) and correlations between POa and
POv were 11.98% [11.05%-12.47%] and 0.77 [0.70-0.82] for average of expert
readers, and 9.56%-9.78% [8.83%-10.22%] and 0.78-0.81 [0.73-0.85] for the CNN,

  spread model","In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of
the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is
modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying
pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary
infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the
model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious
individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A
Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the
relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new
data on the number of new infections and disease related death become
available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate
is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of
the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The
sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the
uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction
number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and
symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the
quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that
plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we
apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from
several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the
proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within
both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the
mitigation measures.

confirm several WSSCI, which demonstrated the basic feasibility of our
WSSCI-based approach. However, it is accurate only in the early stage, and it
was biased after the public announcement of the cluster development. For the
case where the other cluster-related resources, such as fine-grained population

deep mining of all existing protein structures (using PDBMine), and binding
site recognition (using msTALI) to examine the two sites consisting of residues

  Intelligence Approach","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus transmits rapidly; it has
a basic reproductive number R of 2.2-2.7. In March 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 is currently
affecting more than 200 countries with 6M active cases. An effective testing
strategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for
testing surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to
screen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only
seconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a
dataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution
neural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet,
InceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models,
we then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen
COVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A
feature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are
important for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of
AI-assisted applications in clinical practice. The code and dataset used in

tremendous loss of human life and economy in more than 210 countries and
territories around the world. While self-protections such as wearing mask,
sheltering in place and quarantine polices and strategies are necessary for
containing virus transmission, tens of millions people in the U.S. have lost
their jobs due to the shutdown of businesses. Therefore, how to reopen the
economy safely while the virus is still circulating in population has become a
problem of significant concern and importance to elected leaders and business
executives. In this study, mathematical modeling is employed to quantify the
profit generation and the infection risk simultaneously from the point of view
of a business entity. Specifically, an ordinary differential equation model was
developed to characterize disease transmission and infection risk. An algebraic
equation is proposed to determine the net profit that a business entity can
generate after reopening and take into account the costs associated of several
protection/quarantine guidelines. All model parameters were calibrated based on
various data and information sources. Sensitivity analyses and case studies
were performed to illustrate the use of the model in practice.

medical diagnoses across multiple testing modalities (medical images,
electrophysiological signals, etc.). While this field has typically focused on
fully harvesting the signal provided by a single (and generally extremely
reliable) modality, fewer efforts have utilized imprecise data lacking reliable
ground truth labels. In this unsupervised, noisy setting, the robustification
and quantification of the diagnosis uncertainty become paramount, thus posing a
new challenge: how can we combine multiple sources of information -- often
themselves with vastly varying levels of precision and uncertainty -- to
provide a diagnosis estimate with confidence bounds? Motivated by a concrete
application in antibody testing, we devise a Stochastic
Expectation-Maximization algorithm that allows the principled integration of
heterogeneous, and potentially unreliable, data types. Our Bayesian formalism
is essential in (a) flexibly combining these heterogeneous data sources and
their corresponding levels of uncertainty, (b) quantifying the degree of
confidence associated with a given diagnostic, and (c) dealing with the missing
values that typically plague medical data. We quantify the potential of this
approach on simulated data, and showcase its practicality by deploying it on a
real COVID-19 immunity study.

information for specializing to a model which we call {\em adapted
K-McK-model}. This includes effects of vaccination, mass testing and mutants.
We demonstrate the use of the model by applying it to the development in
Germany. As a striking application we demonstrate that a comparatively mild
intervention reducing the time until quarantine by one day leads to a drastic
improvement. A similar effect can be obtained by certain mass testings as we
will demonstrate. We discuss possibilities to apply the model both for
predictions and as an analysis tool. We compare the adapted K-McK-model to the

are not constant. Finally we compare the model reproduction rate with the
empirical reproduction rate determined by the Robert Koch-Institut.

year 2020. Here, we analyze changes in natural gas use in the industry and
built environment sectors during the first half of year 2020 with daily gas
flows data from pipeline and storage facilities in Europe. We find that
reductions of industrial gas use reflect decreases in industrial production
across most countries. Surprisingly, natural gas use in buildings also
decreased despite most people being confined at home and cold spells in March
2020. Those reductions that we attribute to the impacts of COVID-19 remain of
comparable magnitude to previous variations induced by cold or warm climate
anomalies in the cold season. We conclude that climate variations played a
larger role than COVID-19 induced stay-home orders in natural gas consumption
across Europe.

of confirmed cases of COVID-19, including United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil,
United States, etc., which resulted in a large nationwide and even worldwide
wave. While there have been indications that precaution fatigue could be a key
factor, no scientific evidence has been provided so far. We used a stochastic
metapopulation model with a hierarchical structure and fitted the model to the
positive cases in the US from the start of outbreak to the end of 2020. We
incorporated non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) into this model by
assuming that the precaution strength grows with positive cases and studied two
types of pandemic fatigue. We found that people in most states and in the whole
US respond to the outbreak in a sublinear manner (with exponent k=0.5), while
only three states (Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey) have linear reaction
(k=1). Case fatigue (decline in people's vigilance to positive cases) is
responsible for 58% of cases, while precaution fatigue (decay of maximal
fraction of vigilant group) accounts for 26% cases. If there were no pandemic
fatigue (no case fatigue and no precaution fatigue), total positive cases would
have reduced by 68% on average. Our study shows that pandemic fatigue is the
major cause of the worsening situation of COVID-19 in United States. Reduced
vigilance is responsible for most positive cases, and higher mortality rate
tends to push local people to react to the outbreak faster and maintain
vigilant for longer time.

  2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role
of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking
into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters
determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using
data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is
capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of
confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The
drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different
countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as
the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the
occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating
its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that
insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented
infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that
country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model
predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did
not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is
that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a
non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been
deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently
imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving
into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting
the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the
hidden individuals.

  Random Fluctuations from Eigenstate Representation of Correlation Functions","The concept of out-of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) function is treated as
a very strong theoretical probe of quantum randomness, using which one can
study both chaotic and non-chaotic phenomena in the context of quantum
statistical mechanics. In this paper, we define a general class of OTOC, which
can perfectly capture quantum randomness phenomena in a better way. Further we
demonstrate an equivalent formalism of computation using a general time
independent Hamiltonian having well defined eigenstate representation for
integrable supersymmetric quantum systems. We found that one needs to consider
two new correlators apart from the usual one to have a complete quantum
description. To visualize the impact of the given formalism we consider the two
well known models viz. Harmonic Oscillator and one dimensional potential well
within the framework of supersymmetry. For the Harmonic Oscillator case we
obtain similar periodic time dependence but dissimilar parameter dependences
compared to the results obtained from both micro-canonical and canonical
ensembles in quantum mechanics without supersymmetry. On the other hand, for
one dimensional potential well problem we found significantly different time
scale and the other parameter dependence compared to the results obtained from
non-supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, to establish the consistency of
the prescribed formalism in the classical limit, we demonstrate the phase space
averaged version of the classical version of OTOCs from a model independent
Hamiltonian along with the previously mentioned these well cited models.

for people suffering some degree of lockdown in response to a pandemic, as is
the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Persons use their mobile phone or computational
device to request trips to places of their need or interest indicating a rough
time of day: `morning', `afternoon', `night' or `any time' when they would like
to undertake these outings as well as the desired place to visit. An artificial
intelligence methodology which is a variant of Genetic Programming studies all
requests and responds with specific time allocations for such visits that
minimize the overall risks of infection, hospitalization and death of people. A
number of alternatives for this computation are presented and results of
numerical experiments involving over 230 people of various ages and background
health levels in over 1700 visits that take place over three consecutive days.
A novel partial infection model is introduced to discuss these proof of concept
solutions which are compared to round robin uninformed time scheduling for
visits to places. The computations indicate vast improvements with far fewer
dead and hospitalized. These auger well for a more realistic study using
accurate infection models with the view to test deployment in the real world.
The input that drives the infection model is the degree of infection by
taxonomic class, such as the information that may arise from population testing
for COVID-19 or, alternatively, any contamination model. The taxonomy class
assumed in the computations is the likely level of infection by age group.

Systemic health, social and economic disparities have put the minorities and
economically poor communities at a higher risk than others. There is an
immediate requirement to develop a reliable measure of county-level
vulnerabilities that can capture the heterogeneity of both vulnerable
communities and the COVID19 pandemic. This study reports a COVID19
Vulnerability Index (C19VI) for identification and mapping of vulnerable
counties in the United States. We proposed a Random Forest machine learning
based COVID19 vulnerability model using CDC sociodemographic and
COVID19-specific themes. An innovative COVID19 Impact Assessment algorithm was
also developed using homogeneity and trend assessment technique for evaluating
severity of the pandemic in all counties and train RF model. Developed C19VI
was statistically validated and compared with the CDC COVID19 Community
Vulnerability Index (CCVI). Finally, using C19VI along with census data, we
explored racial inequalities and economic disparities in COVID19 health
outcomes amongst different regions in the United States. Our C19VI index
indicates that 18.30% of the counties falls into very high vulnerability class,
24.34% in high, 23.32% in moderate, 22.34% in low, and 11.68% in very low.
Furthermore, C19VI reveals that 75.57% of racial minorities and 82.84% of
economically poor communities are very high or high COVID19 vulnerable regions.
The proposed approach of vulnerability modeling takes advantage of both the
well-established field of statistical analysis and the fast-evolving domain of

county level vulnerability in the United States. This index aims at helping
emergency planners to develop more effective mitigation strategies especially

especially in urban areas. During spring 2020, many countries enacted social
distancing measures in order to slow down the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. A
particularly drastic measure, the ""lockdown"", urged people to stay at home and
thereby prevent new Covid-19 infections. In turn, it also reduced traffic and
industrial activities. But how much did these lockdown measures improve air
quality in large cities, and are there differences in how air quality was
affected? Here, we analyse data from two megacities: London as an example for
Europe and Delhi as an example for Asia. We consider data during and before the
lockdown and compare these to a similar time period from 2019. Overall, we find
a reduction in almost all air pollutants with intriguing differences between
the two cities. In London, despite smaller average concentrations, we still
observe high-pollutant states and an increased tendency towards extreme events
(a higher kurtosis during lockdown). For Delhi, we observe a much stronger
decrease of pollution concentrations, including high pollution states. These
results could help to design rules to improve long-term air quality in
megacities.

  interventions based on epidemiological indicators","Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI) such as banning public events or
instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when
an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold.
Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the
indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use?
In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this
question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and
compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators.
Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of
the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low
as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total
number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological
indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off
between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger
threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators
then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates
the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using
indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models
in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of
models.

its extensions applied to COVID-19, that determines the infection risk due to
airborne transmission of viruses. We assume that the concentration of
infectious particles is governed by an advection-diffusion-reaction equation

infected people and removed due to the room ventilation, inactivation of the
virus and gravitational settling. We consider one asymptomatic or
presymptomatic infectious person who breathes or talks, with or without a mask

flow. A semi-analytic solution is available and this enables fast simulations.
We quantify the effect of ventilation and particle emission rate on the
particle concentration, infection risk and the `time to probable infection'
(TTPI). Good agreement with CFD models is achieved. Furthermore, we derive
power laws that quantify the effect of ventilation, emission rate and
infectiousness of the virus on the TTPI. The model can be easily updated to
take into account modified parameter values. This work paves the way for
establishing `safe occupancy times' at any location and has direct

  in CT Images","Understanding chest CT imaging of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
will help detect infections early and assess the disease progression.
Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an
essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive
clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the
severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the
lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this
end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity
assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe
segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few
infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we
first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image
patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance
deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of
COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet
consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe
segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a
unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context
information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the
performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a
real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results
suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social
distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO
v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort
approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and
assigned IDs. The results of the YOLO v3 model are further compared with other
popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution

classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is
computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the
centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index

  Component Analysis of Weekly Mortality Data -- The Case of COVID-19","The current outbreak of COVID-19 has called renewed attention to the need for
sound statistical analysis for monitoring mortality patterns and trends over
time. Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to
measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality. As such, excess
mortality has received considerable interest during the first months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are
somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends,
correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, and the
autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased
estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be
misinterpreted as excess mortality. We present a blend of classical
epidemiological approaches to estimating excess mortality during extraordinary
events with an established demographic approach in mortality forecasting,
namely a Lee-Carter type model, which covers the named limitations and draws a
more realistic picture of the excess mortality. We illustrate our approach
using weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the
current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our proposed model provides a
general framework that can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor
excess mortality from specific causes of deaths.

COVID-19 outbreak on female and male academics' research productivity in social
science. The lockdown has caused substantial disruptions to academic
activities, requiring people to work from home. How this disruption affects
productivity and the related gender equity is an important operations and
societal question. We collect data from the largest open-access preprint
repository for social science on 41,858 research preprints in 18 disciplines
produced by 76,832 authors across 25 countries over a span of two years. We use
a difference-in-differences approach leveraging the exogenous pandemic shock.
Our results indicate that, in the 10 weeks after the lockdown in the United
States, although the total research productivity increased by 35%, female
academics' productivity dropped by 13.9% relative to that of male academics. We
also show that several disciplines drive such gender inequality. Finally, we
find that this intensified productivity gap is more pronounced for academics in
top-ranked universities, and the effect exists in six other countries. Our work
points out the fairness issue in productivity caused by the lockdown, a finding
that universities will find helpful when evaluating faculty productivity. It
also helps organizations realize the potential unintended consequences that can
arise from telecommuting.

infection that inflames the lungs' air sacs of a human. One of the methods to
detect those inflames is by using x-rays for the chest. In this paper, a
pneumonia chest x-ray detection based on generative adversarial networks (GAN)
with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning for a limited dataset will be
presented. The use of GAN positively affects the proposed model robustness and
made it immune to the overfitting problem and helps in generating more images
from the dataset. The dataset used in this research consists of 5863 X-ray
images with two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. This research uses only 10%
of the dataset for training data and generates 90% of images using GAN to prove
the efficiency of the proposed model. Through the paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet,
Squeeznet, and Resnet18 are selected as deep transfer learning models to detect
the pneumonia from chest x-rays. Those models are selected based on their small
number of layers on their architectures, which will reflect in reducing the

accuracy measurement. The research concludes that the Resnet18 is the most
appropriate deep transfer model according to testing accuracy measurement and
achieved 99% with the other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and

random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the
COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable
controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare
system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes
will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow
informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with
much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time
assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates.
  Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous
population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested
people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current
fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to
real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still
higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in
spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in
place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is
still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of
restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is
demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where
the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.

  to Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) Contained in Cough-Generated Fluid Particles","The ongoing respiratory COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted the social and
private lives of the majority of the global population. This infection is
primarily transmitted via virus-laden fluid particles (i.e., droplets and
aerosols) that are formed in the respiratory tract of infected individuals and
expelled from the mouth in the course of breathing, talking, coughing, and
sneezing. To mitigate the risk of virus transmission, in many places of the
world, the public has been asked or even obliged to use face covers. It is
plausible that in the years ahead we will see the use of face masks, face
shields and respirators become a normal practice in our life. However, wearing
face covers is uncomfortable in some situations, like, for example, in summer
heat, while staying on beaches or at hotel swimming pools, doing exercises in
gyms, etc. Also, most types of face cover become contaminated with time and
need to be periodically replaced or disinfected. These nuisances are caused by
the fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward
and outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen.
Applying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material
based protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air
across the front of the open face. The~protection is driven by dragging
virus-laden particles inside the width of the air flow and hence, as a
consequence, displacing them away from their primary trajectories. The study,
shows that such, potentially portable, air curtains can effectively provide
both inward and outward protection and serve as an effective personal
protective equipment (PPE) mitigating human to human transmission of virus
infection like COVID-19.

significant attention by the scientific community. However, in real-world
scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby
precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in
order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic.
Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only $n$ nodes are observed
at a time and the most central between these $n$ nodes is immunized (or
attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until $1-p$ fraction of nodes
are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this
approach and determine the critical percolation threshold $p_c$ and the size of
the giant component $P_{\infty}$ for networks with arbitrary degree
distributions $P(k)$. In the limit of $n\to\infty$ we recover prior work on
targeted attack, whereas for $n=1$ we recover the known case of random failure.
Between these two extremes, we observe that as $n$ increases, $p_c$ increases
quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with
complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between
$|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|$ and $n$ as $|p_c(\infty)-p_c(n)|\sim n^{-1}\exp(-\alpha
n)$. For Scale-free (SF) networks, where $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}, 2<\gamma<3$, we
find that $p_c$ has a transition from zero to non-zero when $n$ increases from
$n=1$ to order of $\log N$ ($N$ is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks,
knowledge of order of $\log N$ nodes and immunizing them can reduce
dramatically an epidemics.

  lethality across age and sex and predicts that of SARS, supporting possible
  therapy","The fatality rate of Covid-19 escalates with age and is larger in men than
women. I show that these variations correlate strongly with the level of the
viral receptor protein ACE2 in rat lungs, which is consistent with the still
limited and apparently contradictory data on human ACE2. Surprisingly, lower
levels of the receptor correlate with higher fatality. However, a previous
mathematical model predicts that the speed of viral progression in the organism
has a maximum and then declines with the receptor level. Moreover, many
manifestations of severe CoViD-19, such as severe lung injury, exacerbated
inflammatory response and thrombotic problems may derive from increased
Angiotensin II (Ang-II) level that results from degradation of ACE2 by the
virus. I present here a mathematical model based on the influence of ACE2 on
viral propagation and disease severity. The model fits Covid-19 fatality rate
across age and sex with high accuracy ($r^2>0.9$) under the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 infections are in the dynamical regimes in which increased receptor
slows down viral propagation. Moreover, rescaling the model parameters by the
ratio of the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and sex, thus
linking the molecular and epidemiological levels. The presented model opposes
the fear that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), suggested as a therapy
against the most adverse effects of CoViD-19, may favour viral propagation, and
suggests that Ang-II and ACE2 are candidate prognostic factors for detecting
population that needs stronger protection.

disease, novel Coronavirus also known as COVID-19, which spread in more than
200 countries with around 3.3 million active cases and 4.4 lakh deaths
approximately. Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited supply of
testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary for
containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing the
death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed
a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated
with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest
X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named
COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional
neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used
as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and
DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with
lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without
quantization. Results:The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved
performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed
method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas
96.43% for multiclass classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art
methods. Conclusion:Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional results
on various performance metrics. With detailed model interpretations, COVIDLite
can assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 patients from CXR images and can
reduce the diagnosis time significantly.

  France","Large scale virological testing of SARS-Cov2 is implemented since May 2020 in
France. We assume that the positivity of asymptomatic people not being contact
cases (ANBC) is representative of the positivity of the whole French
population, which allows estimating the real incidence. We estimate, using
Sant\'e Public France reports, that the incidence at the beginning of August
was about 0.8% and rose to about 2.4% of the total population at the beginning
of September. This corresponds to about 1.6 million people simultaneously
infected and 230.000 new infections each day. These evaluations allow to deduce
that intensive care units (ICU) admission rate and infection fatality rate
(IFR) dropped by one order of magnitude since March, and are currently 0.036%
and 0.027% respectively. Basic simulations of the outbreak evolution based on
the hypothesis of negligible reinfection probability are performed for France,
Ile de France, Puy de Dome, Bouches du Rhone and Grand Est. These simulations
are using a reproduction rate (R) constant over time ranging from 1.3 to 1.45
(1.15 in Grand Est). They use an estimation of the number of infection which
occurred during the first wave. These simulations also use the estimated
incidence, which by reducing the susceptible population weeks after weeks
induces a saturation of the otherwise exponential growth of the outbreak. An
incidence peak of 3.5 % is expected at week 39 for France. The calculated total
number of ICU admission and deaths during the second wave are 9000 and 7000
respectively for R=1.3. The cumulative incidence over the two waves is computed
close to 60% for R=1.3 and 70% for R=1.4. This suggests that if individual
immunity exists, herd immunity is likely to be achieved in France by the end of
October 2020. We conclude that Covid-19 is much more spread than previously
thought, but its severity became limited since the end of the first wave.

Furthermore, Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major health problem in several low-

individual state-of-the-art pre-trained deep networks for DF extraction with
traditional machine learning classifiers. A pipeline consisting of ResNet-50
for DF computation and ensemble of subspace discriminant classifier was the
best performer in the classification of the five classes, achieving a detection
accuracy of 91.6+ 2.6% (accuracy + 95% Confidence Interval). Furthermore, the

The pipeline was computationally efficient requiring just 0.19 second to

publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited which leads to overfitting
of traditional approaches. To address this problem, we propose an innovative
automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to

emergency should be supported by operational measures to avoid a second virus
spreading. Buildings hosting the continuous presence of the same users and
significant overcrowd conditions over space/time (e.g. large offices,
universities) are critical scenarios due to the prolonged contact with
infectors. Beside individual's risk-mitigation strategies performed (facial
masks), stakeholders should promote additional strategies, i.e. occupants' load
limitation (towards ""social distancing"") and access control. Simulators could
support the measures effectiveness evaluation. This work provides an
Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in the closed built
environment. The model adopts a probabilistic approach to jointly simulate
occupants' movement and virus transmission according to proximity-based and
exposure-time-based rules proposed by international health organizations.
Scenarios can be defined in terms of building occupancy, mitigation strategies
and virus-related aspects. The model is calibrated on experimental data
(""Diamond Princess"" cruise) and then applied to a relevant case-study (a part
of a university campus). Results demonstrate the model capabilities. Concerning
the case-study, adopting facial masks seems to be a paramount strategy to
reduce virus spreading in each initial condition, by maintaining an acceptable
infected people's number. The building capacity limitation could support such
measure by potentially moving from FFPk masks to surgical masks use by
occupants (thus improving users' comfort issues). A preliminary model to
combine acceptable mask filters-occupants' density combination is proposed. The

  airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol","The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been emerged as a rapidly
spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from
person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding
to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by
cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the
majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper
respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral
airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction
of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways.
While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as
well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid
how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells.
The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of
SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this
purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size
distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing
normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct
infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a
bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the
extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we
concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2
infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the
enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less
dangerous...

  COVID-19 Projects","The ability to determine what parts of objects and surfaces people touch as
they go about their daily lives would be useful in understanding how the
COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person has touched an object or
surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer
vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the
2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this
solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to
projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to
infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require
significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint
variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a
person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to
this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact
between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the
object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing
their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected
points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency.
Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep
networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface
space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography
transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life
applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy
detection for studying the COVID-19 transmission pattern from an office desk in
a meeting room using the contact information.

  Twitter","Doctors and nurses in these weeks are busy in the trenches, fighting against
a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are
besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related
terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and
diseases. Arguably the discourse around the current epidemic will make use of
war-related metaphors too,not only in public discourse and the media, but also
in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present
an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a corpus of 200k tweets
posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first
analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show
that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus
treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the
population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to
three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal
frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY literal
frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative framings WAR
is the most frequently used, and thus arguably the most conventional one.
However, we conclude, this frame is not apt to elaborate the discourse around
many aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line
with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options, or a metaphor menu,
may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the
Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in
the expression of their feelings, opinions and ideas during the current
pandemic.

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of paramount importance to the controlling and
combating of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, near
15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great
ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies,
and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive
genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host
immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of
recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the
elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the
viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa
react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of
Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at
increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of
getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities.
Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same
origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type
C$>$T over T$>$C.

also captures the spread of the disease due to the movement of people to/from

probabilistic rise in the number of confirmed cases due to the concomitant
effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple compartments. The
associated parameters in the model can help architect the public health policy

demonstrates that increasing the testing for symptomatic patients does not have
any major effect on the progression of the pandemic, but testing rate of the
asymptomatic population has an extremely crucial role to play. The model is
executed using the data obtained for the state of Chhattisgarh in the Republic

  Embeddings","Social media plays a pivotal role in disseminating news across the globe and
acts as a platform for people to express their opinions on a variety of topics.
COVID-19 vaccination drives across the globe are accompanied by a wide variety
of expressed opinions, often colored by emotions. We extracted a corpus of
Twitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccination and created two classes of
lexical categories - Emotions and Influencing factors. Using unsupervised word
embeddings, we tracked the longitudinal change in the latent space of the
lexical categories in five countries with strong vaccine roll-out programs,
i.e. India, USA, Brazil, UK, and Australia. Nearly 600 thousand vaccine-related
tweets from the United States and India were analyzed for an overall
understanding of the situation around the world for the time period of 8 months
from June 2020 to January 2021. Cosine distance between lexical categories was
used to create similarity networks and modules using community detection
algorithms. We demonstrate that negative emotions like hesitancy towards
vaccines have a high correlation with health-related effects and
misinformation. These associations formed a major module with the highest
importance in the network formed for January 2021, when millions of vaccines
were administered. The relationship between emotions and influencing factors
were found to be variable across the countries. By extracting and visualizing
these, we propose that such a framework may be helpful in guiding the design of

  Stress from COVID-19","When facing an extreme stressor, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare
systems typically respond reactively by creating surge capacity at facilities
that are at or approaching their baseline capacity. However, creating
individual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach,
and redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce
the total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly
distributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to
create surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is
this inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at
over-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal
demand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and
resource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze
a series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of
the demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand
uncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also
incorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers
may need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated
retrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and
Miami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative
to the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are
operationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In
summary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a
practical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly
care for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.

the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to
achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a
very large number of daily contacts. We conduct numerical simulations which

Nevertheless, due to demand and supply constraints, input constraints and
disruption in the supply chain, except agriculture, no other sector would be
able to achieve full capacity of production in 2020-21. The signals from power
consumption, GST collection, contraction in the core sectors hint towards a

as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced
mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users
with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random
tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users'
phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to
learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been
diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end
privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these
approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token
metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users.
  In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing
with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their
contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of
users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides
protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new
cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality
(PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the
intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We
specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients
have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.

  boom in medical research and ultimately digital twins?","After being collected for patient care, Observational Health Data (OHD) can
further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health
informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the
fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a
groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial
sectors, and medical imaging.
  The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying
disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to
common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases,
and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the
healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data
related for the reasons stated above.
  Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to
be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly
reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the
properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms
(unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly
transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.
  We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in
2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and
we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data
modelling, and reproducibility.

  Evidence from Pooled Literature Analysis and Insights from Integrated
  Bioinformatic Analysis","Objective: To conduct a meta-analysis of current studies that examined sex
differences in severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and identify
potential mechanisms underpinning these differences. Methods: We performed a
systematic review to collate data from observational studies examining
associations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web
of Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data
were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary
data presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion
criteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men
were at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with
women. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group
compared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for
male. Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of
ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based
immunological differences exist. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is
positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly
regulate the expression of ACE2. Conclusions: This meta-analysis detected an
increased severity and mortality rate in the male populations with COVID-19,
which might be attributable to the sex-based differences in cellular
compositions and immunological microenvironments of the lung. The host cell
receptor ACE2 is likely regulated by AR signaling pathway, which is identified
as a potential target for prevention and treatment of SARS-Cov-2 infections in
men.

of Covid-19 in China, we propose the artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired
methods for real-time forecasting of Covid-19 to estimate the size, lengths and
ending time of Covid-19 across China. METHODS We developed a modified stacked
auto-encoder for modeling the transmission dynamics of the epidemics. We
applied this model to real-time forecasting the confirmed cases of Covid-19
across China. The data were collected from January 11 to February 27, 2020 by
WHO. We used the latent variables in the auto-encoder and clustering algorithms
to group the provinces/cities for investigating the transmission structure.
RESULTS We forecasted curves of cumulative confirmed cases of Covid-19 across
China from Jan 20, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Using the multiple-step forecasting,
the estimated average errors of 6-step, 7-step, 8-step, 9-step and 10-step
forecasting were 1.64%, 2.27%, 2.14%, 2.08%, 0.73%, respectively. We predicted
that the time points of the provinces/cities entering the plateau of the
forecasted transmission dynamic curves varied, ranging from Jan 21 to April 19,
2020. The 34 provinces/cities were grouped into 9 clusters. CONCLUSIONS The
accuracy of the AI-based methods for forecasting the trajectory of Covid-19 was
high. We predicted that the epidemics of Covid-19 will be over by the middle of
April. If the data are reliable and there are no second transmissions, we can
accurately forecast the transmission dynamics of the Covid-19 across the

helping public health planning and policymaking.

the effect to a Reed-Hughes-like mechanism in which disease arrives at

faster than neighboring subregions and dominate spatially aggregated

such as roads. In the current COVID-19 epidemic, it has been observed that
major roads have enhanced its propagation in Italy. We propose a new simple
model of propagation of epidemics which exhibits this effect and allows for a
quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with
diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected
individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between
individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A
classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system
analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement
of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence
of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when
the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to $1$. More subtle qualitative
features of the final state, showing the important influence of the line, are
also proved here.

  convolutional neural network","Chest X-ray is the first imaging technique that plays an important role in
the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Due to the high availability of large-scale
annotated image datasets, great success has been achieved using convolutional

to the limited availability of annotated medical images, the classification of
medical images remains the biggest challenge in medical diagnosis. Thanks to
transfer learning, an effective mechanism that can provide a promising solution
by transferring knowledge from generic object recognition tasks to
domain-specific tasks. In this paper, we validate and adapt our previously

  for $R_t$ Estimation","In epidemiological modelling, the instantaneous reproduction number, $R_t$,
is important to understand the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases.
Current $R_t$ estimates often suffer from problems such as lagging, averaging
and uncertainties demoting the usefulness of $R_t$. To address these problems,
we propose a new method in the framework of sequential Bayesian inference where
a Data Assimilation approach is taken for $R_t$ estimation, resulting in the
state-of-the-art 'DAR$_t$' system for $R_t$ estimation. With DAR$_t$, the
problem of time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by
incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and
$R_t$; the drawback of averaging is improved by instantaneous updating upon new
observations and a model selection mechanism capturing abrupt changes caused by
interventions; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian
smoothing. We validate the performance of DAR$_t$ through simulations and
demonstrate its power in revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.

  Computing for COVID-19","The COVID-19 epidemic has been a significant healthcare challenge in the
United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), COVID-19 infection is transmitted predominately by respiratory droplets
generated when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. Wearing a mask is the
primary, effective, and convenient method of blocking 80% of all respiratory
infections. Therefore, many face mask detection and monitoring systems have
been developed to provide effective supervision for hospitals, airports,
publication transportation, sports venues, and retail locations. However, the
current commercial face mask detection systems are typically bundled with
specific software or hardware, impeding public accessibility. In this paper, we
propose an in-browser serverless edge-computing based face mask detection
solution, called Web-based efficient AI recognition of masks (WearMask), which
can be deployed on any common devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, computers)
that have internet connections using web browsers, without installing any

compartmental model. This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals'
decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an
individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting
infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers
his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be
high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed,
resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove
theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this
equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal
optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning
that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples
and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental
model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease.
In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and
societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to
individuals' fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still
underway.

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring public health has been challenging. While
contact tracing only aims to track past activities of infected users, one path
to safe reopening is to develop reliable spatiotemporal risk scores to indicate
the propensity of the disease. Existing works which aim to develop risk scores
either rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume
uniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on
reproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics.
Instead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign
relatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging
high-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals.
While COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an
individual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary
mode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore,
we focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility
behaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via
simulation based on real-world mobility data. Our results show that fine-grain
spatiotemporal risk scores based on high-resolution mobility data can provide
useful insights and facilitate safe re-opening.

  Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network","The purpose of this study was to develop a fully-automated segmentation
algorithm, robust to various density enhancing lung abnormalities, to
facilitate rapid quantitative analysis of computed tomography images. A
polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled
left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of
animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural
network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung
regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation.
Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively
evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer,
and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar
segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input
to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using
hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The
proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using
semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images,
achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and
Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four
radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated
and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently
more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe
cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach
was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation
without requiring COVID-19 cases for training.

  spread of COVID-19 epidemic","The COVID-19 has caused more than three million infections and over two
hundred thousand deaths by April 20201. Limiting socioeconomic activities (SA)
is among the most adopted governmental mitigating efforts to combat the
transmission of the virus, though the degree varies dramatically among
different regimes2. This study aims to quantify the contribution from the SA
and weather conditions to the transmission of COVID-19 at global scale. Ruling
out the unobservable factors including medical facilities and other control
policies (MOC) through region-by-time fixed effects3,4, we show that the
limiting SA has a leading contribution to lower the reproductive number by
18.3%, while weather conditions, including ultraviolet, relative humidity, and
wind explain a smaller amount of variation. Temperature might have a
non-monotonic impact on the transmission. We further show that in developed
countries5 and China, the SA effect is more pronounced whereas the weather
effect is significantly downplayed possibly because people tend to stay indoors
most of the time with a controlled climate. We finally estimate the reduced
reproductive number and the population spared from infections due to
restricting SA at 40,964, 180,336, 174,494, in China, United States, and Europe
respectively. From late January to mid-April, all regions, except for China,
Australia, and south Korea show a steep upward trend of spared infections due
to restricting SA. US and Europe, in particular, show far steeper upward trends
of spared infections in the analyzed timeframe, signaling a greater risk of

infections. Face masks have become increasingly accepted as one of the most
effective means for combating the spread of the disease, when used in
combination with social-distancing and frequent hand-washing. However, there is
an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with
clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One
of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to
regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of
these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation
efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these
alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the
performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of
aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields
block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move
around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending
on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an
exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the
exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a
means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the

and regression tasks on chest X-rays. In order to establish trust in the
clinical routine, the networks' prediction mechanism needs to be interpretable.
One principal approach to interpretation is feature attribution. Feature
attribution methods identify the importance of input features for the output
prediction. Building on Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) method, for
each prediction we identify the chest X-ray regions that have high mutual
information with the network's output. Original IBA identifies input regions
that have sufficient predictive information. We propose Inverse IBA to identify
all informative regions. Thus all predictive cues for pathologies are
highlighted on the X-rays, a desirable property for chest X-ray diagnosis.
Moreover, we propose Regression IBA for explaining regression models. Using
Regression IBA we observe that a model trained on cumulative severity score
labels implicitly learns the severity of different X-ray regions. Finally, we
propose Multi-layer IBA to generate higher resolution and more detailed

of the infectious COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, individuals are
not used to tracking the required 6-feet (2-meters) distance between themselves
and their surroundings. An active surveillance system capable of detecting
distances between individuals and warning them can slow down the spread of the
deadly disease. Furthermore, measuring social density in a region of interest
(ROI) and modulating inflow can decrease social distancing violation occurrence
chance.
  On the other hand, recording data and labeling individuals who do not follow
the measures will breach individuals' rights in free-societies. Here we propose
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based real-time social distancing detection and
warning system considering four important ethical factors: (1) the system
should never record/cache data, (2) the warnings should not target the
individuals, (3) no human supervisor should be in the detection/warning loop,
and (4) the code should be open-source and accessible to the public. Against
this backdrop, we propose using a monocular camera and deep learning-based
real-time object detectors to measure social distancing. If a violation is
detected, a non-intrusive audio-visual warning signal is emitted without
targeting the individual who breached the social distancing measure. Also, if
the social density is over a critical value, the system sends a control signal
to modulate inflow into the ROI. We tested the proposed method across
real-world datasets to measure its generality and performance. The proposed
method is ready for deployment, and our code is open-sourced.

  World","While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life
in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much
public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus
pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among
solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or
slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social
distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of
social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing
down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be
minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every
individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can
minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be
found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large
class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social
sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes
many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and
can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or
allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible
distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and
analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different
contact values are assigned to different network sites.

however, has the effect to make the system enter in its critical regime with a
number of infected individuals potentially large. We describe how such
non-trivial starting conditions affect the critical behavior of the SIR model.
We perform a theoretical and large-scale numerical investigation of the model.
We show that the expected outbreak size is an increasing function of the

individuals. Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations

cyclical curve log-regression, and multivariate time series spatial residual
correlation analysis. Specifically, the mean quadratic loss function is
minimized in the framework of trigonometric regression. While, in our
subsequent spatial residual correlation analysis, maximization of the
likelihood allows us to compute the posterior mode in a Bayesian multivariate
time series soft-data framework. The presented approach is applied to the
analysis of COVID-19 mortality in the first wave affecting the Spanish
Communities, since March, 8, 2020 until May, 13, 2020. An empirical comparative
study with Machine Learning (ML) regression, based on random k-fold
cross-validation, and bootstrapping confidence interval and probability density
estimation, is carried out. This empirical analysis also investigates the
performance of ML regression models in a hard- and soft- data frameworks. The
results could be extrapolated to other counts, countries, and posterior
COVID-19 waves.

traditional compartmental models, our approach allows a more faithful
description of virus specific features, such as distributions for the time
spent in stages, which is crucial when the time-scale of control (e.g.,
mobility restrictions) is comparable to the lifetime of a single infection. We
apply the model to the first and second wave of COVID-19 in Italy, shedding

  Initial Results for Automated Detection & Patient Monitoring using Deep

quantification, and tracking of Coronavirus; demonstrate they can differentiate
coronavirus patients from non-patients. Materials and Methods: Multiple
international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were
included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning
models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with
clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to
analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19
thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient
over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study
includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results:
Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT
studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and
infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2%
specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output
enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and
visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume
display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over
time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a
larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis

passports' and even technical proposals. Although the debate about the medical
and ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been
less inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes.
These schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and
vaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes
have involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized
Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity
standards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents
that have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the
questionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity
passports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography
theater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to
allay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization.
Deployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases
like immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity
totalitarianism.

  Patients","Machine Learning (ML) models typically require large-scale, balanced training
data to be robust, generalizable, and effective in the context of healthcare.
This has been a major issue for developing ML models for the
coronavirus-disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where data is highly imbalanced,
particularly within electronic health records (EHR) research. Conventional
approaches in ML use cross-entropy loss (CEL) that often suffers from poor
margin classification. For the first time, we show that contrastive loss (CL)
improves the performance of CEL especially for imbalanced EHR data and the
related COVID-19 analyses. This study has been approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. We use EHR data
from five hospitals within the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) to predict
mortality, intubation, and intensive care unit (ICU) transfer in hospitalized
COVID-19 patients over 24 and 48 hour time windows. We train two sequential
architectures (RNN and RETAIN) using two loss functions (CEL and CL). Models
are tested on full sample data set which contain all available data and
restricted data set to emulate higher class imbalance.CL models consistently
outperform CEL models with the restricted data set on these tasks with
differences ranging from 0.04 to 0.15 for AUPRC and 0.05 to 0.1 for AUROC. For
the restricted sample, only the CL model maintains proper clustering and is
able to identify important features, such as pulse oximetry. CL outperforms CEL
in instances of severe class imbalance, on three EHR outcomes with respect to
three performance metrics: predictive power, clustering, and feature
importance. We believe that the developed CL framework can be expanded and used
for EHR ML work in general.

recommendation systems, robot assistants are envisioned to become more present
in the hospitality industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also
highlighted the need to have more service robots in our everyday lives, to
minimise the risk of human to-human transmission. One such example would be
coffee shops, which have become intrinsic to our everyday lives. However,
serving an excellent cup of coffee is not a trivial feat as a coffee blend
typically comprises rich aromas, indulgent and unique flavours and a lingering
aftertaste. Our work addresses this by proposing a computational model which
recommends optimal coffee beans resulting from the user's preferences.
Specifically, given a set of coffee bean properties (objective features), we
apply different supervised learning techniques to predict coffee qualities
(subjective features). We then consider an unsupervised learning method to
analyse the relationship between coffee beans in the subjective feature space.
Evaluated on a real coffee beans dataset based on digitised reviews, our
results illustrate that the proposed computational model gives up to 92.7
percent recommendation accuracy for coffee beans prediction. From this, we
propose how this computational model can be deployed on a service robot to
reliably predict customers' coffee bean preferences, starting from the user
inputting their coffee preferences to the robot recommending the coffee beans
that best meet the user's likings.

  in Russian Federation","In this paper it is demonstrated that the application of principal components
analysis for regional cluster modelling and analysis is essential in the
situations where there is significant multicollinearity among several
parameters, especially when the dimensionality of regional data is measured in
tens. The proposed principal components model allows for same-quality
representation of the clustering of regions. In fact, the clusters become more
distinctive and the apparent outliers become either more pronounced with the
component model clustering or are alleviated with the respective hierarchical
cluster. Thus, a five-component model was obtained and validated upon 85
regions of Russian Federation and 19 socio-economic parameters. The principal
components allowed to describe approximately 75 percent of the initial
parameters variation and enable further simulations upon the studied variables.
The cluster analysis upon the principal components modelling enabled better
exposure of regional structure and disparity in economic development in Russian
Federation, consisting of four main clusters: the few-numbered highest
development regions, the clusters with mid-to-high and low economic
development, and the ""poorest"" regions. It is observable that the development
in most regions relies upon resource economy, and the industrial potential as
well as inter-regional infrastructural potential are not realized to their
fullest, while only the wealthiest regions show highly developed economy, while
the industry in other regions shows signs of stagnation which is scaled further
due to the conditions entailed by economic sanctions and the recent Covid-19
pandemic. Most Russian regions are in need of additional public support and
industrial development, as their capital assets potential is hampered and,
while having sufficient labor resources, their donorship will increase.

of Covid-19 on the spatiotemporal distribution of Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) demands in Travis County, Austin, Texas and propose a robust model to
forecast Covid-19 EMS incidents in the short term to improve EMS performance.
Methods: We analyzed the number of EMS calls and daily Covid-19 hospitalization
in the Austin-Travis County area between January 1st, 2019 and December 31st,
2020. Change point detection was performed to identify critical dates marking
changes in EMS call distributions and time series regression was applied for
our prediction model. Results: Two critical dates mark the impact of Covid-19
on EMS calls: March 17th, when the daily number of Non-Pandemic EMS incidents
dropped significantly, and May 13th, by which the daily number of EMS calls
climbed back to 75% of pre-Covid-19 demand. New daily Covid-19-hospitalization
alone proves a powerful predictor of pandemic EMS calls, with an $r^2$ value
equal to 0.85. Conclusion: The mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demands
was significantly less than the period prior to Covid-19 pandemic. The number
of EMS calls for Covid-19 symptoms can be predicted from the daily new
hospitalization of Covid-19 patients. In particular, for every 2.5 cases where
EMS takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, 1 person is admitted.
