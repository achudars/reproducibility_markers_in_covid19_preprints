59bzv,preprints,2021-01-22,Initial impacts of COVID-19 on youth offending: An exploration of differences across communities,"A number of international studies have found that the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with reductions in crime, primarily due to changes in the routine activities of the population. However, to date there has been no targeted exploration of how COVID-19 may have influenced youth offending, which may be more heavily impacted by the changes heralded by COVID-19 containment measures. This study examines changes in youth offending in an Australia jurisdiction, Queensland, following the implementation of COVID-19 containment measures from the period April to June, 2020. Additionally, differences in impacts across community types were explored. Findings from panel regression indicated significant declines in youth property offending, offences against the person and public order offences in this period, but no significant changes in illicit drug offences. There were also significant differences across communities according to socio-economic status, per cent Indigenous population, and the extent of commercial or industrial land use. Findings are explored with reference to environmental crime theories and the potential impacts of social, economic and policing changes that occurred in this period.",TRUE,2021-01-22,2021-01-22,2021-01-21T14:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,community characteristics|COVID-19|pandemic|property offending|routine activities theory|social distancing|youth offending,2021-01-22T06:23:01.983416,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-22,FALSE,NA,no,Data is available from the Griffith University Social Analytics Laboratory.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Molly McCarthy|Jacqueline Homel|James Ogilvie|&amp; Troy Allard,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/citation/,59bzv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600a2f2b75226b0039514c89/,600a2f2b75226b0039514c89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/59bzv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/59bzv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/59bzv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
qgtue,preprints,2021-01-21,The Gendered Consequences of a Weak Infrastructure of Care: School Reopening Plans and Parents’ Employment During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has upended in-person public education across the United States, a critical infrastructure of care that parents—especially mothers—depend on to work. To understand the nature and magnitude of school closures across states, we collected detailed primary data—the Elementary School Operating Status database (ESOS)—to measure the percentage of school districts offering in-person, remote, and hybrid instruction models for elementary schools by state in September 2020. We link these data to the Current Population Survey to evaluate the association between school reopening and parents’ labor force participation rates, comparing 2020 labor force participation rates to those observed pre-pandemic in 2019.  We find that, across states, the maternal labor force participation rate fell to a greater extent than that of fathers. In 2019, mothers’ rate of labor force participation was about 18 percentage points lower than fathers’. By 2020, this gap grew by five percentage points in states where schools offered primarily remote instruction. We show that schools are a vital source of care for young children, and that without in-person instruction, mothers have been sidelined from the labor force. The longer these conditions remain in place, the more difficult it may be for mothers to fully recover from prolonged spells of non-employment, resulting in reduced occupational opportunities and lifetime earnings.",TRUE,2021-04-12,2021-01-21,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|employment|gender|inequality|mothers|public schools,2021-01-21T20:08:02.409080,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-21,FALSE,NA,available,Uses data fro m Current Population Survey (available through IPUMS) and ESOS (Elemetnary School Operating Status) database which is not yet publicly available but will soon be in 2021.,https://osf.io/zeqrj/,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/citation/,qgtue,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zeqrj/,zeqrj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6009d8d6e80d370a4da56fd1/,6009d8d6e80d370a4da56fd1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qgtue/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qgtue/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qgtue,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Issues created by such pandemic e.g. loss of communication; shut down of school, college and universities; disruption of the formal learning process etc provoke us for the transformation of the learning process from conventional to digital. The primary requirement of this transformation is the availability of a sophisticated, affordable and multitasking tool for providing library services. It is now challenging for the libraries to satisfy their user needs and time to rethink and remodel their services by adopting technological changes. Today mobile phones are becoming an integral part of everyday life and are changing the way one connects and interacts with the world. This paper presents an outline of the concept and the application of developments in mobile telecommunication systems, web technologies to provide ubiquitous, user-friendly, personalized and dynamic up to date information services to the users of a library. Also, further studies are expanded to provide insight into the benefits and challenges against the implementation of mobile technologies to support this ‘new normal’ in the libraries.

We assess individual-level panel data collected weekly between 20 March and 25 June (N=2,297), which allows us to examine the risks of short-time work, furlough, and job loss, as well as changes between working on-site and from home. Using sequence analysis, we detect typical patterns of employment trajectories and analyse how these vary between socio-demographic groups. Finally, we relate the types of employment trajectories to changes in income, subjective job security (compared to values in January and February 2020), and COVID-19 infection risks. Our results show clear gradients in employment risks: low-wage workers were severely affected by furlough and job loss, while highly qualified employees were able to work from home. Furthermore, in contrast to previous crises, service sector and female employees were more affected by short-time work; however, its timing and duration differs compared to male workers in manufacturing. Income loss was pronounced among those who became unemployed and those continuously in short-term work, while everybody—including employees continuously working from home—experienced a significant reduction in subjective job security compared to employees whose employment hours or location have not changed.

f4jsy,preprints,2021-01-14,Socioeconomic disparities in school absenteeism after the first wave of COVID-19 school closures in Scotland,"Key Points
-	Student absences after the first wave of Covid-19 school closures were higher than in previous years
-	Higher rates of absenteeism after school lockdown were due to COVID-19 related reasons
-	Overall, non-Covid-19-related absence rates are similar to trends observed in earlier years 
-	Socioeconomic inequalities in school absenteeism were higher post-lockdown than in previous years
-	This increase can be attributed to rising disparities in school absenteeism due to Covid-19-related and non-Covid-19 reasons
-	The rise in socioeconomic inequality in non-Covid-19related absenteeism was not only due to higher absence rates among students from the most deprived areas but also due to lower absence rates among students from the least deprived areas
-	Addressing the  disproportionate short- and long-term  impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable children needs to be at the forefront of policy agenda
-	We need greater monitoring and evaluation of

258cd,preprints,2021-01-14,Challenges of e-Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic Experienced by EFL Learners,"COVID-19 has disrupted most of the industries in the world. Education is the only industry that is completely transferred to online mode in most countries around the world. Online learning was the best solution for continuing education during the pandemic, especially in tertiary education. This study aims to determine the challenges and obstacles confronted by English language learners (EFL) in Science and Arts College, Alula, Taibah University, Saudi Arabia, during switching to online learning in the second semester of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The contribution of this study is to evaluate the learners’ new experiences in online education and to assess the feasibility of the virtual methods of learning. This is achieved by analyzing 184 learners’ responses to the survey-based questionnaire. A descriptive statistical method was used to test the validation of the study. It is found that the main problems that influence and impact online EFL learning during COVID-19 are related to technical, academic, and communication challenges.  The study results show that most EFL learners are not satisfied with continuing online learning, as they could not fulfill the expected progress in language learning performance.",TRUE,2021-01-14,2021-01-14,NA,10.24093/awej/vol11no4.23,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 Pandemic|EFL learners|learning challenges|Online learning|Taibah University,2021-01-14T04:42:45.553981,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-14,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c92|Arts and Humanities|European Languages and Societies,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/citation/,258cd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fffbb1386541a052a14befa/,5fffbb1386541a052a14befa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/258cd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/258cd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/258cd,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol11no4.23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using data from the COVID-19 add-on-survey for CILS4EU-DE (CILS4COVID), we demonstrate that immigrants from Asian origin report an increasing CAD during the pandemic, which is more pronounced for respondents residing in administrative districts with a more dynamic COVID-19 situation. Similar results can be found for respondents originating from both American continents and from countries of the former Soviet Union. Given that COVID-19 was first reported in Asia, but with rather low number of infections later on, and the rather high infection rates on both American continents and in Russia, we conclude that CAD experienced by these groups might happen in a reaction to both realistic and symbolic threats posed by the virus.",TRUE,2021-01-13,2021-01-13,2021-01-12T23:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Asians|COVID-19|COVID-19 associated discrimination|Germany|intergroup threat theory (ITT)|symbolic and realistic threat,2021-01-13T22:40:03.464113,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-13,FALSE,NA,no,Data of the CILS4COVID-add on study will be availbale at the end of March 2021 at the GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences in Cologne.

We overcome this limitation using data from the U.S. Current Population Survey’s COVID-19 supplement to study pandemic-related labor force outcomes from May through December of 2020 in rural and urban areas. We find the pandemic has generally had a more severe labor force impact on urban residents than their rural counterparts. Urban adults were more likely to be unable to work, not paid for missed hours, and be unable to look for work due to COVID-19. However, rural workers were less likely to be able to work remotely than urban workers.

vbku6,preprints,2021-01-10,Working Paper - Digital News Media Coverage on Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in Kenya: Scoping the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Working Paper - Centre of Excellence in Women and Child Health, UNESCO Chair on Youth Leadership, Aga Khan University, Kenya. Background: Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in Kenya is frequently covered in digital news media. As a powerful influencer of public opinion, news media coverage can have a significant societal impact. This scoping review identifies the extent, nature, and themes of all available digital news media coverage on SGBV in Kenya from June 2019 to July 2020. It analyzes changes in coverage since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: The methodological framework for scoping reviews developed by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) guided the scoping review. The selected articles were analyzed using NVivo.
Results: Analysis of the 340 included articles indicates clear trends in news media coverage on SGBV in Kenya. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, trends include high numbers of news reports, feature articles, and opinion pieces on SGBV, female genital mutilation (FGM) as the most covered form of SGBV, and opinion pieces in line with the Kenya Vision 2030 agenda. Since the implementation of the COVID-19 mitigation measures in Kenya, trends include an increase in news media coverage on SGBV, extensive reporting on the causes of the rise in SGBV cases in Kenya, and increased media attention for domestic and sexual violence.
Conclusions: Analysis of the news media coverage demonstrates the health advocacy/agenda-setting role of the media. The increased reporting on SGBV since the implementation of the COVID-19 mitigation measures could facilitate broad-based awareness.",TRUE,2021-02-28,2021-01-10,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 Pandemic|Kenya|News Media|Scoping Review|Sexual and Gender-Based Violence|SGBV,2021-01-10T17:48:41.777450,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-10,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e16|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Health Communication,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/citation/,vbku6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ffb330fba010902788959f1/,5ffb330fba010902788959f1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vbku6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vbku6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vbku6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
q9b23,preprints,2021-01-04,Avoiding a public health dilemma: Social norms and trust facilitate preventive behaviour if individuals perceive low COVID-19 health risks,"Until a vaccine becomes available, a frequently adopted strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic involves three non-pharmaceutical interventions that crucially depend on high adherence in society: maintaining physical distance from others, minimizing social contacts, and wearing face masks. These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April to October 2020 we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. Moderation analyses show that the effectiveness of social norms and trust in institutions in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people's perceptions of health risks decrease. This result suggests that trust in institutions and strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates of preventive behaviour when perceived levels of health risks are low.",TRUE,2021-01-06,2021-01-04,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|Institution|Preventive Behaviour|SARS-CoV-2|Social Norms|Trust,2021-01-04T17:41:45.078494,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-04,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.11587/28KQNS,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,Bernhard Kittel|Fabian Kalleitner|David Wolfgang Schiestl,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/citation/,q9b23,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/375nh/,375nh,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ff2f577e9ccb904abaee697/,5ff2f577e9ccb904abaee697,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q9b23/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q9b23/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q9b23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

University Course Enrollment Networks before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"In normal times, the network ties that connect students on a college campus are an asset; during a pandemic, they can become a liability. Using pre-pandemic data from Cornell University, Weeden and Cornwell showed how co-enrollment in classes creates a “small world” network with high clustering, short path lengths, and multiple independent pathways connecting students. In this paper, we show how the structure of the enrollment network changed as Cornell, like many American colleges and universities, shifted to a hybrid instructional model with some courses online and others in person. Under this model, about half of students are disconnected from the in-person co-enrollment network. In this network, paths lengthened, the share of student pairs connected by three or fewer degrees of separation declined, and clustering increased, with a greater share of ties occurring between students in the same field. The small world became both less connected and more fragmented.  (Corrected page proofs.

e5z73,preprints,2021-01-02,Using Predictive Analytics for Public Policy: The Case for Lost Work due to the COVID-19,"In this brief research article, I demonstrate how predictive analytics or machine learning can be used to predict outcomes that are of interest in public policy. I developed a predictive model that determined who were not able to work during the past four weeks because the COVID-19 pandemic led their employer to close or lose business. I used the Current Population Survey (CPS) collected from May to November 2020 (N=352,278). Predictive models considered were logistic regression and ensemble-based methods (bagging of regression trees, random forests, and boosted regression trees). Predictors included (1) individual-, (2) family-, (3) and community or societal- level factors.

We compared monthly marriage and divorce counts for two years prior to the pandemic (2018 and 2019), and during the pandemic for the five states that published monthly vital statistics data for 2020 (Arizona, Florida, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oregon). All five states witnessed an initial dip in marriage. Counts of marriages in Arizona and New Hampshire rebounded. In contrast, a marriage shortfall occurred in Florida, Missouri, and Oregon. In the early pandemic months divorces initially declined in all five states and rebounded in Arizona. In the remaining four states a divorce shortfall has occurred. Based on these results we provide national estimates of the marriage and divorce response to the pandemic.

js8by,preprints,2020-12-28,Inefficient Procurement in Times of Pandemia,"The public health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has pushed governments to substantially and swiftly increase spending. Consequently, public procurement rules have been relaxed in many places to expedite transactions. However, this may also create opportunities for inefficiency and corruption. Using contract-level information on public spending from Colombia’s e-procurement platform, and a difference-in-differences identification strategy, we find that municipalities classified by a machine learning algorithm as more prone to corruption react to the spending surge by using a larger proportion of discretionary non-competitive contracts and increasing their average value, especially to procure crisis-related items. In these places, contracts signed during the emergency are more likely to have cost overruns, be awarded to campaign donors, and exhibit a range of implementation inefficiencies.

We evaluate the short- and medium-term impacts of lockdown policies on civic attitudes relevant for the health of democracy. Using survey data collected daily between March and May 2020 in the United States and four European countries from 27,317 respondents and a difference-in-differences design, we document that lockdown policies give rise to authoritarian values and, to a lesser degree, support for autocracy. We find little evidence that lockdown policies affect satisfaction with democracy and the government, out-group hostility, and generalized trust. Additional analyses reveal that the effects on authoritarianism and support for autocracy persist for at least seven weeks, that the lifting of lockdown policies does not have a countervailing effect away from authoritarianism and support for autocracy, and that economic support packages have limited ability to alleviate the negative consequences of lockdowns on civic attitudes. Together, these findings confirm the existence of lockdowns' political repercussions, but show the need for a nuanced assessment of their scope.

Eighty-eight Thai second-year undergraduate accounting majors at Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Hat Yai, Thailand took part in the study. The participants completed 10 language-in-talk log assignments over 10 weeks. A pre- and post-questionnaire was administered before and after the intervention to examine the effect of the log assignments in developing participants’ learner autonomy. The reflective log was also used to gather participants’ perceptions of using the log assignments in a conversation course. The results showed that the language-in-talk log assignments aided in enhancing the students’ learner autonomy to set learning goals, select appropriate learning materials, take responsibility, and evaluate their learning. Seeking social assistance, however, did not have a significant difference in mean scores, and participants expressed dissatisfaction over not being able to interact with their peers as in classroom learning. The findings further highlighted the significance of teachers’ presence in scaffolding learners to achieve full autonomy.

Academically, we are challenged to explore whether existing theoretical frameworks hold in this new environment with combined old and new policy frameworks. We are also challenged to understand the nuanced ways in which the first lockdown affects the combination of paid work and care. We address both of these issues, providing a cross-sectional comparative analysis of highly educated mothers’ perceptions of work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland and the Netherlands. Our findings show that highly educated Finnish mothers have more difficulty combining work and care during the first lockdown than Dutch mothers. The absence of state-provided care during the lockdown creates greater difficulty for full-time working Finnish mothers in a dual-earner/state-carer system than an absence of such care in the Dutch one-and-a-half earner system, where most mothers work part-time. Further analyses suggest variation in part-time and (nearly) full-time hours mitigates the work-life balance experiences of highly educated Dutch mothers.

Online Practices and Learning Processes of Students Between Professional Routines and Psychosocial Challenges,"The development of digital games over physical distance is a common practice in the gaming industry, yet widely neglected in the curricula of digital game development programs at university level. The coronavirus pandemic, however, pushed project-oriented game programs all over the world towards an implementation of ad hoc approaches to remote development in their project-based courses. The present article demonstrates  practice-based research examining such a course and its 30 third-year undergraduate students of game arts, game design, and game programming, who remotely collaborated in interdisciplinary groups of two to five persons over the course of half a semester during Germany’s logdown in spring 2020.

68fpr,preprints,2020-12-21,How to Get Away with Spreading COVID-19: Political Connections and Pandemic Response,"While the aim of COVID-19 policies is to suppress the pandemic, many fear that the burden of the restrictions will fall more heavily on less privileged groups. We show one potential mechanism for COVID-19 responses to increase inequality by examining the intersection of business restrictions and business political connections. Using an online survey of 2,735 business employees and managers in Ukraine, Egypt and Venezuela over the summer of 2020, we show that businesses with political connections to government officials were significantly less likely to shut down as a result of COVID-19 policies. This finding suggests that measures designed to mitigate COVID-19 are less effective in countries with a weak rule of law if politically connected firms are able to circumvent restrictions by leveraging political connections to receive preferential treatment. In addition, politically-connected firms are no more likely--and sometimes even less likely--to engage in social-distancing policies to mitigate the pandemic despite the fact that they are more likely to remain open.",TRUE,2020-12-23,2020-12-21,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,business politics|corruption|COVID-19|politically-connected companies,2020-12-21T03:12:41.741737,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-21,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/citation/,68fpr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdffc10149e75061b028260/,5fdffc10149e75061b028260,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/68fpr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/68fpr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/68fpr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Engaging in a collective approach to autoethnographic writing, we highlight different perspectives of a cultural moment shaped by the science denialism and untruths that define U.S. governmental practices and approaches to the pandemic. We share how we are dealing with COVID-19 discourses that run counter to the scientific foregrounding of our STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) and health and medical sciences training, reflect on the role of the pandemic in shifting post- baccalaureate plans, navigate the lockdown while participating in racial justice protests in Minneapolis, and examine the experiences of being essential healthcare workers while in school.

4esf7,preprints,2020-12-18,Working From Home and the Division of Housework and Childcare Among Dual Earner Couples During the Pandemic in the UK,"This paper examines how working from home influenced the division of childcare and housework among dual earning heterosexual couples with children in the UK during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown. We use unique data gathered during the peak of the UK lockdown (May-June), when many employees were required to work from home, to see whether fathers flexible working was associated with a more equitable division of housework and childcare. We found mothers were more likely to be the ones carrying out more if not all of five of the six categories of housework and care we examined – namely, cooking, cleaning, routine and non-routine childcare, and the education of children/home-schooling, both before and during the lockdown. This was not the case for the DIY tasks. A multivariate regression analysis showed that when fathers worked from home or using flexitime during the lockdown, a more equal division was found for tasks such as cleaning, routine childcare, and to some extent home schooling. Furthermore, fathers who worked flexibly were more likely to report that they had increased the amount of time they spent on housework and care. Mothers also reported that fathers who worked from home increased the time they spent on routine childcare. Overall, the study shows how flexible working, including working from home among men, especially done on a mass scale where there are no negative assumptions or stigma behind its use, may lead to a more equitable distribution of housework and childcare. Policy makers should encourage more men to work from home in order to support families and women’s labour market participation during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,2020-12-18,2020-12-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,childcare|COVID-19 pandemic|division of housework|Fathers|flexible working|Gender|work from home,2020-12-18T21:42:02.526272,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-18,FALSE,NA,no,The data will be made available after the embargo period  in 2022.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/citation/,4esf7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bja7/,8bja7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fdce17af0df54057a2ed92e/,5fdce17af0df54057a2ed92e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4esf7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4esf7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4esf7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
f6jkx,preprints,2020-12-16,STEM undergraduates’ perspectives of instructor and university responses  to the COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020,"Objectives: We examined undergraduate STEM students’ experiences during Spring 2020 when universities switched to remote instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we sought to understand actions by universities and instructors that students found effective or ineffective, as well as instructor behaviors that conveyed a sense of caring or not caring about their students’ success. 
Methods: In July 2020 we conducted 16 focus groups with STEM undergraduate students enrolled in US colleges and universities (N=59). Focus groups were stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Thematic analyses were conducted on the data. Results: Participants (N=59; 51% female) were racially/ethnically diverse (76% race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white) and from 32 colleges and universities. The most common effective instructor strategies mentioned included hybrid instruction (35%) and use of multiple tools for learning and student engagement (27%). The most common ineffective strategies mentioned were increasing the course workload or difficulty level (18%) and use of pre-recorded lectures (15%). The most common behaviors cited as making students feel the instructor cared about their success were exhibiting leniency and/or flexibility regarding course policies or assessments (29%) and being responsive and accessible to students (25%). The most common behaviors cited as conveying the instructors did not care included poor communication skills (28%) and increasing the difficulty of the course (15%). University actions students found helpful included flexible policies (41%) and moving key services online (e.g., tutoring, counseling; 24%). Students felt universities should have created policies for faculty and departments to increase consistency (26%) and ensured communication strategies were honest, prompt, and transparent (23%). Conclusions: To be prepared for future emergencies, universities should devise evidence-based policies for remote operations and all instructors should be trained in best practices for remote instruction.

vc9jb,preprints,2020-12-10,"COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy, misinformation and conspiracy theories on social media: A content analysis of Twitter data","Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant burden of mortality and morbidity. A vaccine will be the most effective global preventive strategy to end the pandemic. Studies have maintained that exposure to negative sentiments related to vaccination on social media increase vaccine hesitancy and refusal.  Despite the influence social media has on vaccination behavior, there is a lack of studies exploring the public's exposure to misinformation, conspiracy theories, and concerns on Twitter regarding a potential COVID-19 vaccination. 
Objective: The study aims to identify the major thematic areas about a potential COVID-19 vaccination based on the contents of Twitter data.  
Method: We retrieved 1,286,659 publicly available tweets posted within the timeline of July 19, 2020, to August 19, 2020, leveraging the Twint package. Following the extraction, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modelling and identified 20 topics discussed in the tweets. We selected 4,868 tweets with the highest probability of belonging in the specific cluster and manually labeled as positive, negative, neutral, or irrelevant. The negative tweets were further assigned to a theme and subtheme based on the content
Result: The negative tweets were further categorized into 7 major themes: ""safety and effectiveness,” ""misinformation,” ""conspiracy theories,” ""mistrust of scientists and governments,” ""lack of intent to get a COVID-19 vaccine,” ""freedom of choice,"" and ""religious beliefs.  Negative tweets predominantly consisted of misleading statements (n=424) that immunization against coronavirus is unnecessary as the survival rate is high. The second most prevalent theme to emerge was tweets constituting safety and effectiveness related concerns (n=276) regarding the side effects of a potential vaccine developed at an unprecedented speed. 
Conclusion: Our findings suggest a need to formulate a large-scale vaccine communication plan that will address the safety concerns and debunk the misinformation and conspiracy theories spreading across social media platforms, increasing the public's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination.",TRUE,2021-03-07,2020-12-11,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-12-11T17:56:21.848971,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-11,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,no,None.,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/citation/,vc9jb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fd21e140694b700b9f3897c/,5fd21e140694b700b9f3897c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc9jb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vc9jb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vc9jb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
9nzr7,preprints,2020-12-09,Using structural equation modeling to model compliance with COVID-19 related non-pharmaceutical interventions amongst university students in the United States,"The world is currently dealing with a devastating pandemic. Although growing COVID-19 case numbers, deaths, and hospitalizations are concerning, this spread is particularly alarming in the United States where polarizing opinions, changing policies, and misinformation abound. In particular, American college campuses have been a venue of rampant transmission, with concerning spillover into surrounding, more vulnerable, communities. We surveyed over 600 college students from across the United States and modeled predictors of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identified concern with severity (p &lt; .001), constitutional originalist ideology (p &lt; .001), news exposure (p &lt; .001) and religiosity (p &lt; .05) as significant positive correlates with compliance, and general trust in science (p &lt; .05) as a significant negative correlate. To determine how applicable nationwide modeling might be to individual local campuses we also administered this same survey to nearly 600 students at two large universities in Utah County. In this population, concern with severity was the only significant positive correlate with compliance (p &lt; .001); Additionally, feelings of inconvenience was negatively correlated (p &lt; .001). The effects of feelings of inconvenience, and news exposure were significantly different between populations (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001).

am49t,preprints,2020-12-05,Emergency Physicians and Personal Narratives Improve the Perceived Effectiveness of COVID-19 Public Health Recommendations on Social Media: A Randomized Experiment,"Background: Containment of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires the public to change behavior under social distancing mandates. Social media are important information dissemination platforms that can augment traditional channels communicating public health recommendations. The objective of the study is to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 public health messaging on Twitter when delivered by emergency physicians and containing personal narratives. 
Methods: On April 30, 2020, we randomly assigned 2007 U.S. adults to an online survey using a 2x2 factorial design. Participants rated 1 of 4 simulated Twitter posts varied by messenger type (emergency physician vs federal official) and content (personal narrative vs impersonal guidance). Main outcomes were: perceived message effectiveness (35-point scale); perceived attitude effectiveness (15-point scale); likelihood to share Tweets (7-point scale); and writing a letter to their governor to continue COVID-19 restrictions (write letter or none).
Results: The physician/personal message had the strongest effect and significantly improved all main messaging outcomes except for letter-writing. Unadjusted mean differences between physician/personal and federal/impersonal were: perceived messaging effectiveness (3.2 [95%CI, 2.4-4.0]); perceived attitude effectiveness (1.3 [95%CI, 0.8-1.7]); likelihood to share (0.4 [95%CI, 0.15-0.7]). For letter-writing, physician/ personal made no significant impact compared to federal/ impersonal (odds ratio 1.14 [95%CI, 0.89-1.46]). 
Conclusions: Emergency physicians sharing personal narratives on Twitter are perceived to be more effective at communicating COVID-19 health recommendations compared to federal officials sharing impersonal guidance.",TRUE,2020-12-06,2020-12-06,2020-12-02T05:00:00,10.1111/acem.14188,TRUE,FALSE,civic engagement|COVID-19|emergency physicians|health education|perceived message effectiveness|physician advocacy|public health|public health messaging|randomized controlled trial|randomized experiment|social media|survey experiment|twitter,2020-12-06T16:01:43.926845,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-06,FALSE,NA,no,Please contact the corresponding author for data sharing agreement,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/kabvr/,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/citation/,am49t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t8g5w/,t8g5w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fcc0caeaa60b802c78949bb/,5fcc0caeaa60b802c78949bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/am49t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/am49t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/am49t,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14188,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Minnesota seemingly stands out as an exception to this national pattern, with white Minnesotans accounting for 80% of the population and 82% of COVID-19 deaths. We examine confirmed COVID mortality alongside deaths indirectly attributable to the pandemic -- ‘excess mortality’ -- in Minnesota. This analysis reveals profound racial disparities: age-adjusted excess mortality rates for whites are exceeded by a factor of 2.8-5.3 for all other racial groups, with the highest rates among Black, Latino, and Native Minnesotans. The seemingly small disparities in COVID deaths in Minnesota reflect the interaction of three factors: the natural history of the disease whose early toll was heavily concentrated in nursing homes; an exceptionally divergent age distribution in the state; and a greatly different proportion of excess mortality captured in confirmed-COVID rates for white Minnesotans compared with most other groups.",TRUE,2020-12-06,2020-12-06,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|excess mortality|racial disparities,2020-12-06T16:08:21.220465,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-12-06,FALSE,NA,no,Data access is controlled by the Minnesota Department of Health.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/citation/,rs4ph,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fcaaa33aa60b8025e895ebf/,5fcaaa33aa60b8025e895ebf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rs4ph/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rs4ph/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rs4ph,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

84ygx,preprints,2020-11-29,The potential impact of co-residence structures on socio-demographic inequalities in COVID-19 mortality,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, confinement measures were adopted across the world to limit
the spread of the virus. In France, these measures were applied between March 17 and May 10. Using
high-quality population census data and focusing on co-residence structures on French territory, this
article analyses how co-residence patterns unevenly put different socio-demographic groups at risk of
being infected and dying from COVID-19. The research ambition is to quantify the possible impact
of co-residence structures heterogeneity on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality stemming from
within-household transmission of the virus. Using a simulation approach, the article highlights the
existence of theoretical pronounced inequalities of vulnerability to COVID-19 related to cohabitation
structures as well as a reversal of the social gradient of vulnerability when the age of the infected
person increases. Among young age categories, infection is simulated to lead to more deaths in the
less educated or foreign-born populations. Among the older ones, the inverse holds with infections
having a greater potential to provoke deaths through the transmission of the virus within households
headed by a highly educated or a native-born person. Demographic patterns such as the cohabitation
of multiple generations and the survival of both partners of a couple help to explain these results.
Even though inter-generational co-residence and large households are more common among the lower
educated and foreign born in general, the higher educated are more likely to still live with their
partner at higher ages.",TRUE,2021-03-22,2020-11-30,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Age|COVID-19|Demography|Education|Household structure|Mortality|Nativity|Social Inequalities,2020-11-30T05:32:21.736038,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-30,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://international.ipums.org/international-action/variables/group,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Julien Giorgi,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/citation/,84ygx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fc3df15ab6518036cb146e7/,5fc3df15ab6518036cb146e7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/84ygx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/84ygx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/84ygx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

kjb2f,preprints,2020-11-25,How Families Matter for Health Inequality during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"A version of this article has been published in the Journal of Family Theory and Review, https://doi.org/10.1111/jftr.12398                                          
 We theorize that social conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to increase the importance of families for health and widen existing inequalities. We suggest three primary tenets important for understanding families and health during COVID-19. First, risks of specific COVID-19 outcomes and other health problems are unevenly distributed across families. Second, how families impact health during the COVID-19 pandemic is conditional on public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events. Third, many health inequalities driven by racism, sexism, classism, and other oppressive societal force are amplified during COVID-19, but the extent to which this is occurring is shaped by families and by the public policies, organizational decisions, and concurrent events that also impact families and health.

Many academic institutions were not ready for such a rapid change. The remote learning of foreign languages during the COVID-19 lockdown caused modern teaching technologies to expand the scope of the educational process, broaden its practical orientation, contribute to the intensification of students' independent work, increasing their cognitive activity. The goals of the article include: to define types and specifics of modern edTech for the educational process on the way of transition from no E-Learning to fully E-Learning; to eliminate the role of the Internet as means of information and communication edTech in teaching foreign languages at higher education establishments; to find out the ways of improving students' learning at higher educational establishments, the importance of using distance edTechs and Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, &amp; Challenges (SWOC) analysis of E-learning techniques during the pandemic lockdown.

ax783,preprints,2020-11-24,The Perceived Deservingness of COVID-19 Health Care: A Conjoint Experiment on Priority Access to Intensive Care and a Vaccine,"Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, governments, supported by health experts and ethicists, released guidelines about which groups should receive priority access to both (intensive) care and vaccines as resources are limited. To achieve political legitimacy, support from the general public is important, as deservingness theory informs us that not all groups are equally perceived as deserving of assistance. Relying on a probability-based sample representative of the Dutch population (N = 1,601), participants were offered two choice-based conjoint experiments that measured what deservingness criteria matter most in respectively priority access to intensive care, and priority access to a COVID-19 vaccine. The results foremost show that noncompliance with government measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus impedes perceived deservingness. By contrast, being employed in the ‘crucial’ sector (i.e. health care and to a lesser extent education), leads to a higher perceived priority. Having an unhealthy BMI leads to less support for priority access to intensive care and vaccines. Age shows mixed patterns: public opinion would give less priority to elderly patients for intensive care. These results indicate that, control and reciprocity over need are important criteria to determine people’s deservingness of COVID-19 health care.

ax9vm,preprints,2020-11-23,"Social and Non Social Media Users During The COVID-19 Pandemic Confinement Period in Canada: The ""Plugged-In"", Unplugged and Other Population Segments","Canadians are using a variety of social and non-social media vehicles to gather information, share experiences and express anxieties during the COVID-19 confinement period. The purpose of the study is to produce a portrait of media use in Canada, paying special attention to the typical population segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their media vehicles and sources of information about the pandemic. The study used as its data source a survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the period of July 20-26 2020, and collected by Statistics Canada. Media user activities comprised a set of 11 dichotomous scales collecting data on main sources of information such as social media posts, online news, online magazines, video platforms, e-mails as well as non internet-based sources.  A market segmentation analysis of these scales using Principal Components and k-means cluster analysis revealed the presence of six major population segments: Social Media Buffs (27%), News Followers (33%), Unplugged (10%),Plugged-In (9%), E-Mailers (7%) and Mixed Source Users (16%). The segment mottos were as follows: ""Social Media Influencers Know Their Stuff!"", ""Track Those Headlines!"", ""I’ve Got My Own Info Sources About The Pandemic!"", ""Did You Read The Last Blog?"" ""My People Know Better!"" and ""Better Info Means More Choices!"". This study suggests that  media users in Canada constitute a very diverse group of individuals who are engaged in social and non social media to obtain timely information about the pandemic. However, they can also be exposed to inaccurate, misleading information about the virus, its transmission and its treatments. In this light, market segmentation may be  a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns directed at population segments, help design messages, and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with their target audiences.",TRUE,2020-11-24,2020-11-24,2020-11-23T05:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Canada|COVID-19 Pandemic|Marketing Segmentation,2020-11-24T06:45:03.106375,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-24,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.fern2350.com/how-is-the-covid-19-pandemic-changing-the-lives-of-canadians.html,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,Fernando Mata,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/citation/,ax9vm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fbbbe9d5502ac05248c66a0/,5fbbbe9d5502ac05248c66a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ax9vm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ax9vm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ax9vm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The COVID-19 pandemic can exacerbate the already existing socio-economic gaps between family structures. To investigate this issue, we analyze how experiences and concerns vary across living arrangements along two dimensions that may be associated with social disadvantage: loneliness and care. In doing so, we employ quantitative text analysis on open-ended questions from novel survey data on a sample of about 1,100 individuals living in Germany. We focus our analyses on four different household structures: Living alone, shared living without children, living with a partner and children, and single parents. We find that single parents (who are primarily single mothers) are at the high risk of experiencing care-related worries, particularly regarding their financial situation, while individuals living alone are most likely to report feelings of loneliness. Those living in shared houses, with or without children, had the lowest risk of experiencing both loneliness and care-related worries.

3d4ny,preprints,2020-11-17,The Coronavirus Pandemic and Voter Turnout: Addressing the Impact of Covid-19 on Electoral Participation,"External shocks have been shown to be able to alter countries’ political dynamics in a deep manner. The number of works examining the impact of economic crisis, natural disasters or even terrorist attacks are numerous. However, the literature addressing the political effects of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is still in its infancy. Definitively, the pandemic has constituted an unpredictable external shock not only affecting the health of millions around the planet but also damaging the economic and social stability of most countries. Politically, it has forced electoral authorities in some countries to postpone elections (e.g. Kiribati, North Macedonia, Sri Lanka), to suspend voting rights for those infected with the virus (e.g. Galicia and Basque Country in Spain) or to adapt postal vote regulations (e.g. Bavaria in Germany) in order to guarantee citizens’ voting rights and diminish electoral fraud. Trying to fill a lacuna in the literature, the goal of this article is to give a first and nuanced examination on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted electoral participation all over the world. To that end we have collected data on all parliamentary, presidential and regional elections held worldwide during the first seven months since the COVID-19 outbreak became recognized as a health emergency of global scope and started to affect the organization of elections (March 1st-September 30th, 2020). Our results show that while voter turnout has not generally declined in comparison with those elections held before the pandemic, electoral participation is lower in polities hit by the pandemic the most, both in terms of infections and – especially - deceases. This seems to point to the fact that when faced with a choice (civic duty vs. personal risk), the fear of becoming infected will constrain voters to opt for the former.",TRUE,2020-11-18,2020-11-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Elections|External shocks|Voter turnout,2020-11-18T22:43:22.908042,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-18,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,Andrés Santana; José Rama; Fernando Casal Bértoa,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/citation/,3d4ny,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fb40311def8eb01c3e7a69f/,5fb40311def8eb01c3e7a69f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3d4ny/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3d4ny/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3d4ny,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
5yebc,preprints,2020-11-17,Aging during COVID-19 in Germany: A Longitudinal Analysis of Psychosocial Adaptation and Attitudes Toward Aging,"Available theories of aging suggest that there may be similarities and differences in how COVID-19 impacts older peoples’ psychosocial adaptation compared to younger age groups, particularly mid-aged individuals. We analyzed data from 3,215 participants between 40 and 79 years gathered at three measurement occasions between the start of the nation-wide lock-down mid-March 2020 and its lifting early August 2020 in an online survey in Germany. The survey focused on everyday experiences during the COVID-19 crisis and collected various satisfaction ratings (e.g., general life satisfaction, satisfaction with family life, satisfaction with social contacts). Participants also provided retrospective satisfaction ratings for their situations before the COVID-19 crisis at baseline. For a small sub-sample of 29 participants (48–78 years), we explored how attitudes toward own aging (ATOA) measured prior to the crisis may have played a role in satisfaction ratings during the crisis. Both mid-aged and older participants experienced the greatest decreases in satisfaction in the social domain, with more pronounced decreases seen in mid-aged participants. We also observed a partial recovery effect in all measures at T3, and this effect was more pronounced in older adults.

sn9xu,preprints,2020-11-12,Collective Anxieties of Canadians During The COVID-19 Pandemic: The Angst-Free and Anxious Population Segments,"The COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada represents a very troubling period as individuals confront a powerful ""invisible"" enemy killer in the form of the COVID-19 virus. This historical juncture is important to analyze because it constitutes a moment where collective anxieties become widespread and collective resources are mobilized to address them. Using market segmentation analysis, the purpose of the study is to produce a portrait of collective anxieties, paying special attention to the typical population segments in the Canadian population differentiated by their particular concerns about health and social conditions in the country and the world. The study used as its data source a survey sample of 4,600 adult Canadians aged 15 years old and over during the confinement period of March 29 2020 to April 3 2020 and collected by Statistics Canada. Attitudinal domain items (12 in total) included concerns about personal and household health, the health system, the ability to cooperate and support during and after the crisis, family stress and others. A market segmentation analysis using Principal Components and k-means cluster analysis of these domain items revealed the presence of six major population segments: Health Conditions Anxious (13%), Health System Overload Anxious (26%), Angst-Free (23%), Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious (12%), Outer-Bubble Conditions Anxious (25%) and World Conditions Anxious (1%). The segment mottos were as follows: ""Glad I Have A Health Card!"", ""How Many Beds Do We Have?"", ""I'm Not Worried!, ""My Bubble May Be In Trouble!"", ""Other Bubbles May Be In Trouble! and ""It’s the End of the World As We Know It!”. Inner-Bubble Conditions Anxious members displayed the higher average scores of collective anxiety and Angst-Free members, the lowest. Market segmentation is a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members by their typical attitudinal traits and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design messages, and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with the various psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.",TRUE,2020-11-12,2020-11-12,2020-11-12T05:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Collective Anxieties|COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-11-12T15:17:40.945513,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.fern2350.com/collective-anxieties-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-canada.html,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology,Fernando Mata,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/citation/,sn9xu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fad3f6680ff8e00968d936f/,5fad3f6680ff8e00968d936f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn9xu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sn9xu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sn9xu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
c2vd5,preprints,2020-11-11,"COVID-19 and the Way Forward: A Story of Livelihoods from Coastal Rural Sundarbans, West Bengal","Globally around 2 billion people (⁓ 61% of the total world population) are engaged in informal sector, whereas the percentage rises to more than 80% in India (ILO, 2018). Since 25th March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in India due the COVID-19 pandemic has created an atmosphere of extreme uncertainty and raised several questions. Global analysts have already suggested that, for many developing countries, the economic consequences could be more crippling and devastating than the disease itself. Livelihoods are vital means of making a living. The terminology Livelihood is not synonymous to mere income generation. It encompasses people’s capabilities, assets and activities required to secure the necessities of life. Undoubtedly, globally COVID-19 has become an unprecedented shock; however, any kind of shock tends to reinforce the existing socio-economic-political and environmental stresses, problems and inequalities. Therefore, there is a need to understand how and to what extent this pandemic has affected and going to affect the lives and livelihoods of a coastal rural community entirely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, small-scale fisheries (inland and marine) and other riverine as well as forest resources for their subsistence. This paper attempts to explore the impact of COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown the livelihood choices and daily lives in the coastal rural stretches of Indian Sundarbans delta region. This study incorporates a telephonic rapid assessment survey method to understand the impact of COVID-19; for assessing the minute detailing and pathways of livelihoods, this paper refers to findings from a questionnaire-based household survey of the concerned area carried out by the author herself. The findings support the argument that the shock of COVID-19 will further aggravate the preexisting socioeconomic issues. The long withstanding local problems as well as backwardness and COVID-19 are mutually reinforcing in nature; the social cost and economic cost of this pandemic is immense. Asset loss, changes in dietary pattern and consumption, increased indebtedness, increased dependence on natural resources are some of the major findings.",TRUE,2020-11-12,2020-11-12,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Indian Sundarbans|Livelihood Diversity|Vulnerability,2020-11-12T01:28:22.026845,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12,FALSE,NA,no,Data was collected through primary survey by the researcher,NA,no,Mixed method was employed.

4mby7,preprints,2020-11-10,Voting Plans and Mask-Wearing Practices During the 2020 U.S. National Election,"Background: While U.S. continues to face increasing rates of COVID-19, there is concern that voting behavior during the 2020 U.S. Presidential election may contribute to additional outbreaks and infections among communities. The purpose of the current study was to assess the impact of the spread of the COVID-19 infection and mask-wearing behavior on voting behaviors and political affiliation during the 2020 national election.
Methods: During a two-week period from September into October 2020, YouGov, in association with Saint Louis University, conducted an online cross-sectional survey consisting of participants that were likely to vote in Missouri in the upcoming national election (n=931). 
The sample was stratified into two groups: those that reported always wearing a mask or face-covering in public spaces and those that did not. Individual socio-demographics and environmental factors were compared between these groups to identify significant differences according to mask-wearing patterns. Additionally, two adjusted multivariate models were constructed to determine probability of (1) reporting always wearing a mask and (2) planning on voting in-person on election day. Indicators in each model included reported political party affiliation, and urbanicity, presence of mask mandate, and recent COVID-19 rate, respective of reported Missouri county of residence.  
Results: The sample consisted of 931 participants across Missouri that were likely to vote during the 2020 Presidential election. Among this sample, 38.5% resided in counties with a mask mandate at the time of the survey.
Individuals who resided in either suburban or urban counties were twice as likely to report always wearing a mask compared to rural residents. In addition, while individuals from counties with a mask mandate were over twice as likely to report always wearing a mask, county COVID-19 infection rates were not found to be a significant predictor of mask-wearing. Republicans and Independents were significantly less likely to report always wearing a mask. Compared to Democrats, Republicans were 4 times, and Independents were 2 times, more likely to vote in person on election day compared to Democratic party members. These results were significant even when adjusting urbanicity, residing in a county with a mask mandate, and county COVID-19 case-rate. While urbanicity and COVID-19 infection rate were determined to not add significantly to model performance, those that lived within a county with a mask mandate were nearly 50% less likely to vote in person on election date.
Discussion: Overall, this study identified significant relationships that are likely to contribute to the spread of COVID-19. Individuals who identified as Republican and Independent party members were more likely to vote in-person on election day and less likely to always wear a mask in public spaces. The interaction between political party affiliation and mask wearing highlights the concerning dichotomy within political discourse and highlights an opportunity to develop novel interventions that reduce the current political division that exists within the U.S.",TRUE,2020-11-13,2020-11-12,2020-11-10T06:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Behavior|Coronavirus Infection|COVID-19|Election|Mask|Pandemic|Politics|Prevention and Control|Voter,2020-11-12T01:31:21.928807,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-12,FALSE,NA,no,"Data was collected as a cross-sectional proprietary survey.

yuqw2,preprints,2020-11-10,Suppression and Timing: Using COVID-19 Policies against Political Dissidents?,"In this paper, we explore whether government incentives to repress domestic dissidents influences the adoption, timing, and duration of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that governments which have historically repressed internal dissent are more likely to adopt policies in response to the pandemic which are observationally equivalent to those that they would use to limit domestic dissent --- in particular policies that restrict citizen's freedom of movement --- compared to countries that have not. Empirically, we find that governments that have recently engaged in state violence against civilians have been more likely to enact lockdown and curfew policies, have done so earlier in the pandemic, and have implemented these policies over a longer time period.

gnk5a,preprints,2020-11-09,An analysis of policy decisions to combat SARS-CoV-2 transmission: comparing the available evidence and policies of public face masking to social distancing,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world in early 2020, many country leaders endorsed social distancing policies to reduce transmission. Public face masking policies, however, were only endorsed by a few countries in eastern Asia until recently. Herein, we review the theory and evidence behind public face masking and social distancing. We find a complete absence of adequate randomized trials for social distancing and only a few for public masking, but similar levels of evidence that both interventions could work to reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Given the similar levels of evidence, it is strange that social distancing was promoted in the absence of public face masking policies, particularly so with the detrimental emotional, social, and economic side effects that social distancing entails.

9y6s5,preprints,2020-11-05,On the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the intention to leave the parental home,"With the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic all over Europe during the first months of 2020, most of the European governments imposed restrictive measures to people mobility and physical distance (the lockdown), which severely impacted on the economic activities and performance of many countries. Thus, the health emergency turned rapidly into in an economic crisis. The Covid-19 crisis in Europe increased the uncertainty about the economic recovery and the end of the health emergency. This situation is supposed to have conditioned individuals’ life course path with the effect of inducing people to postpone or to abandon many life plans. 
This paper aims to explore whether the rise of health emergency due to the Covid-19 has delayed or vanished young people intention to leave the parental home during the 2020 in five European countries: Italy, Germany, France, Spain and UK. Using data from an international survey from the “Youth Project”, carried out by the Toniolo Institute of Advanced Studies, this paper implements ordered logistic models in order to investigate the determinants of a possible revision of the choice of leaving the parental home for a representative sample of 6,000 respondents aged 18 to 34, interviewed between March and April 2020. A special focus has been pointed on the Italian case, because of being the first European country to be strongly hit by the pandemic and because of the already economic vulnerable conditions of its young population.
Results reports that Italy is the country with the highest rate of downward revisions of the intentions of leaving the nest. In particular, having negative expectations about changes in the individual’s and family’s future income is a key predictor of the choice of abandoning the purpose of leaving the parental home across Europe. However, the vulnerability of the category of temporary workers arises especially in Italy: young people with precarious jobs seems to be the most prone to negatively revise their intentions of leaving, even compared with those not working.",TRUE,2020-11-05,2020-11-05,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|Covid-19|Intentions|Leaving parental home|SARS-CoV2,2020-11-05T11:55:01.867134,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-05,FALSE,NA,no,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from Istituto Toniolo but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.

khe42,preprints,2020-11-05,Factors Influencing Countries’ Success Level in Curbing COVID-19:  From A Socio-Ecological System (SES) Perspective,"Little attention has been paid to interactions between institutional-human-environment dimensions, which are believed to impact the outcome of COVID-19 abatement. Thus, through the diagnostic SES framework analysis, this paper aims to investigate what and how the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affect the success level of 7 selected Asia-Pacific countries (namely South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand) in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on secondary data from February 2020 to June 2020, the success or severity level of a country was measured by cumulative positive cases, average daily increase, and the mortality rate. A qualitative content analysis, covering code assignation, i.e., Present (P), Partially Present (PP), Absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as rank ordering (from 1st to 7th) and score calculation (from 3 to 21) for the success level between the countries, was undertaken. Attributes (design principles) of SES factors, such as past experiences facing similar diseases, facilities mobility, lockdown measures, penalty, and standard of procedures in public spaces are deemed significant in determining the abatement outcome or severity of a country. The findings show that Vietnam (1st) and New Zealand (2nd) adopting most of the design principles of governance (with the scores of 15 and above) had successfully eliminated the virus, while Indonesia (7th) and Japan (6th) were deemed least successful (scoring between 3-9), likely due to the low presence frequency of design principles. Not only does the study validate SES framework adaptability in a health-related (non-commons) setting, where some design principles used in resource/commons governance are also relevant in explaining the COVID-19 outcome, the critical attributes of institutional-social-ecological factors are highlighted, ultimately helping policymakers devise more strategic measures to address the crisis",TRUE,2020-11-09,2020-11-09,2001-04-30T16:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Asia-Pacific|Coronavirus|Design Principles|Institutional-social-ecological system|SES,2020-11-09T04:16:21.084904,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-09,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",Gabriel Hoh Teck Ling,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/citation/,khe42,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa3c8a4a5bb9d01230a02d3/,5fa3c8a4a5bb9d01230a02d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/khe42/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/khe42/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/khe42,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A marketing segmentation analysis was carried out using a roster of 13 perceived health risks items leading to the identification of typical fears and the profiling of five major segments present in the Canadian adult population: ""Germophobes"" (7%), ""Crowd-Averse"" (34%), ""Fearless"" (17%), ""Outside ""Bubble""-Averse"" (18%), and """"Nursing Homes-Averse"" (24%). Health risk  items included a wide range of preoccupations such as visiting retirement homes, travelling by car or airplane, attending public events, shopping, eating out, seeing doctors and/or participating in sports or gyms. The five population segments were identified using a combination of principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis.

Information, data and materials which are the basis for decisions made by policy and strategy makers are acquired from a vast and chaotic mixture of sources. Those are produced based on opinions of experts from diverse fields, results of statistical or clinical studies, official or covert economic interests, political opinions or media pressure and many more inputs. This study presents a concrete example of a possible instrument for correction for the influence of the potentially misleading view in media or society.

Methods: Using a questionnaire, this study heuristically quantifies the perceptions of a selected group of Faculty of Science, Palacký University Olomouc employees towards the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic. We presume that overall they possess more experience with critical analysis and recognizing the relevance of the data than the general population.

Results: The respondents assume that based on the data they believe to be relevant COVID-19 is less than or comparably dangerous as seasonal flu (34.1 %) or several times or by an order of magnitude more dangerous (54,1 %); implementing wearing face covering inside is in total for the population rather beneficial (83,8 %), or disadvantageous or without any significance (7,5 %), the daily count of infected is relevant (49,7 %), or irrelevant (42,2 %); the exposure rate in the population is relevant (55,2 %), or irrelevant (34,0 %); the percentage of the Czech population that has already been exposed to the virus is 5% or less (46,5 %), or 6% or more (29,2 %). The respondents view the government measures as relevant and sufficient or insufficient (58,9 %), or relevant but excessive (20,0 %), or irrelevant and excessive or absurd (9,2 %). A significant amount of further data has been derived from the results presented in this study.

Conclusion: Certain results of the perceptions quantification reflect the predominant media discourse (such as the question of the benefit of wearing face coverings inside), other seem to differ or contradict the discourse (such as the comparison with seasonal flu or the preference for the exposure data over the daily infected count). As a conclusion, it can be ascertained that when correctly implemented a verified survey of a predefined closed group of respondents can be an applicable instrument for a potential correction for the prevailing public and media paradigm.",TRUE,2020-11-05,2020-11-05,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,covid-19 Czech Republic|Faculty of science UPOL|survay as a tool in public health,2020-11-05T13:10:25.005129,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-11-05,FALSE,NA,no,The data are available from the authors upon request.,NA,no,-,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,Pavel Rušar; Radim Kapavík,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/citation/,8zdxk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5fa288ad23568c0088d68593/,5fa288ad23568c0088d68593,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8zdxk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8zdxk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8zdxk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We identify four key themes developing over time. In relation to evolving Covid-19 prevention policies 1) the lockdown interrupted life and experiences of temporality. 2) Following the lockdown, risk management changed from fear to insecurities and 3) simultaneously, emotion management transitioned from solidarity to fragmentation. 4) Increasingly, pragmatic considerations allowed parents to tackle uncertainties and created room to normalize everyday life.

A marketing segmentation analysis was carried out using a roster of 26 typical weekly activity items leading to the extraction of typical activity patterns and the identification of six major segments present in the Canadian adult population: ""Hygienists"" (25%), ""Caregivers""(14%), ""Sound Body Minders"" (23%), ""Home-centric"" (19%), ""Media-centric"" (9%) and ""Oblivious"" (10%). Weekly activities included a wide range of actions such as washing hands, avoiding crowds, watching T.V., internet browsing, exercising, alcohol consumption and others. The six population segments were identified using a combination of principal component and k-means cluster statistical analysis. Marketing segmentation is a useful tool for decision makers to categorize population members and, by doing so, facilitate better public campaigns, help design messages and implement changes that can promote more efficient ways to deal with the various societal consequences of the COVID-19 confinement.",TRUE,2020-10-30,2020-10-30,2020-10-29T04:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Canada|COVID-19 pandemic|Market Segmentation|Routine Activities,2020-10-30T07:09:01.176643,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-30,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.fern2350.com/uploads/4/6/3/7/4637956/routine_acts_segments_v5_november2020_ed.pdf,no,Available at author's website: https://www.fern2350.com/,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health,None,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/citation/,6vumh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f9b472587b7df04203b6a91/,5f9b472587b7df04203b6a91,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vumh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vumh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vumh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

ve4z7,preprints,2020-10-28,Learning Loss Due to School Closures During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for student learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here we evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from the Netherlands (n≈350,000). We use the fact that national exams took place before and after lockdown, and compare progress during this period to the same period in the three previous years. The Netherlands underwent only a relatively short lockdown (8 weeks), and features an equitable system of school funding and the world's highest rate of broadband access. Still, our results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations. The effect is equivalent to a fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, we find that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum entropy weights, or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family. The findings imply that students made little or no progress whilst learning from home, and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.",TRUE,2021-02-09,2020-10-29,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-10-29T01:59:42.141026,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-29,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/mzc4w/?view_only=f9d557fb6df94457a1fb959fea3a83df,prereg_both,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d59|Education|Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/citation/,ve4z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f995b4687b7df03233b06fe/,5f995b4687b7df03233b06fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ve4z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ve4z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ve4z7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
7famk,preprints,2020-10-28,Crucial Occupations during the Covid-19 Pandemic:  Wage Trends leading up to the Pandemic in the Netherlands,"In March 2020, the Dutch government defined a set of occupations that were designated as crucial for maintaining the basic functioning of society during the Covid-19 pandemic. A central question in the current public debate on work and pay is whether workers in crucial occupations have been sufficiently remunerated for their work over the past years. Using a combination of the Dutch labor force survey and register data during the period 2006-2019, we find that the wages of workers in crucial occupations have on average improved over time relative to the wages of workers in other occupations, although this development has stalled in recent years. At the same time, workers in crucial occupations earn less relative to comparable workers in other occupations within several industries, while they often earn more within major occupational groups. The analysis also reveals substantial heterogeneity in wage gaps and their trends across industries. We conclude by formulating some preliminary thoughts on the potential long-term consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on the relationship between occupations and wages.",TRUE,2020-10-29,2020-10-29,2020-10-27T23:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,corona|covid-19|crucial occupations|inequality|netherlands|wages,2020-10-29T01:58:01.051812,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-29,FALSE,NA,no,Used data is made available by the microdata service of Statistics Netherlands (CBS) after signing a project agreement.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/citation/,7famk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/scvp3/,scvp3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f993c7010172102b5a47f26/,5f993c7010172102b5a47f26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7famk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7famk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7famk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
tsqyb,preprints,2020-10-28,LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER: A Challenge for Medically Optimal Coronavirus Social Distancing Policies,"Public health efforts aiming to slow the COVID-19 epidemic and protect the vulnerable by reducing interpersonal contact and increasing interpersonal physical distance have achieved considerable success. About three-quarters of Americans report following all the recommended practices. But there is an elephant in the room: Overnighting – staying overnight at someone else’s home or having them stay overnight at your place -- is rarely mentioned publicly. But we find that overnighting is widespread throughout the epidemic thus far. In the past month, over half American adults had at least one overnight guest and about the same number (but not always the same people) spent at least one night at somebody else's home. The consequences are striking:  People who overnight are more than twice as likely to report having had COVID-19. Who overnights? Overnighting is much more common among young adults (over 60% for those 25-34) than among their seniors (dipping below 40% for those age 65 and over).

q5zk9,preprints,2020-10-27,"What happened to drug detections and drug-offences during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A comparison of recorded offence rates and dynamic forecasts (ARIMA) in Queensland, Australia","Public commentary has offered mixed opinion on the likely impact of COVID-19 restrictions on drug-related offending. On the one hand, it is argued that drug users—and the drug markets in which they interact—may have become the incidental targets of law enforcement as police seek to enforce social distancing regulations by focusing their efforts on street-level pedestrian activity or open-air gatherings. On the other, interstate border closures and restrictions on person and freight traffic are thought to have interrupted illicit drug supply chains, temporarily reducing or displacing market activity at the street level and thus reducing police detections of drug users. In this study, we extend current analyses of crime during the COVID-19 pandemic to explore how the rate of police detection for drug possession and other drug-related offences has changed. Using Queensland crime data, we use Auto-Regressive and Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modelling techniques to explore historical trends and their dynamic forecasts. We then compare actual offence rates for March through June to identify any statistically significant changes. Importantly, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 regulations to be universal, mostly because of the significant heterogeneity in local drug market dynamics that has elsewhere been documented. Our analysis has significant import for criminal justice practitioners in further understanding drug market dynamics and drug-related offending during COVID-19 restrictions.",TRUE,2020-10-29,2020-10-29,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,ARIMA|Australia|COVID-19|drug-crime|drug possession|pandemic|Queensland|sell-supply|trafficking,2020-10-29T02:01:42.166908,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-29,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Cameron T.

u9ehf,preprints,2020-10-27,Pseudoscience in the times of crisis: How and why chlorine dioxide consumption became popular in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the economic and political landscape of the world (Blofield et al., 2020; Greer et al., 2020). Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have been particularly vulnerable to the effects of the disease (Breevoort et al., 2020; Dahab et al., 2020; Elhadi, et al., 2020; Loayza and Pennings, 2020). Yet, LMIC regions have different approaches to disease response, control and monitoring. For instance, while Africa centralizes these roles in the Africa Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC) (Wadvalla, 2020), Latin American countries lack a common health administration, making them more susceptible to complications due to poverty, comorbidity and political dynamics (Pablos-Mendez et al., 2020).

Traditional and social media have been important to disseminate information related to disease containment and treatment (Basch et al, 2020; Hopman et al., 2020). Yet, these tools have also served to spread misinformation, conspiracy theories and “miracle cures” for COVID-19 (Malinverni and Brigagão 2020; Moreno-Castro, et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2020). In Latin America, there are several instances in which media trends have shaped policy and resulted in dangerous interventions to fight the pandemic (Oliveira et al., 2020). These have included the administration of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin (Mega, 2020), as well as the use of untested convalescent plasma as therapy for COVID-19 (Ferreira and Mostajo-Radji, 2020).

	While the world was horrified by President Donald Trump’s suggestion of drinking household disinfectants to prevent COVID-19, less has been mentioned about the extensive use of chlorine dioxide as treatment in Latin America.  Chlorine dioxide is a disinfectant commonly used to clean medical equipment and treat residual waters (Smith et al., 2001).  At high concentrations and non-physiological pH, chlorine dioxide effectively inhibits microbial and viral activity (Hauchman et al., 1986; Zoffoli et al., 2005). Exposure to high doses of chlorine dioxide has been shown to cause thyroid suppression, DNA damage and neurotoxicity in several animal models (Abdel-Rahman et al., 1984; Bercz et al., 1982; Harrington et al., 1986; Orme et al., 1985; Toth et al, 1990). It is therefore understood that chlorine dioxide is not safe for human consumption. 

At the global scale, the dissemination of pseudoscience and post-truth phenomena is often associated with income inequalities (Rijs and Fenter, 2020).

3jfwu,preprints,2020-10-27,Crime and COVID-19: Effect of changes in routine activities in Mexico City,"**Background.**
This study aimed to determine whether crime patterns in Mexico City changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test whether any changes observed were associated with the disruption of routine activities.

**Method.**
The first objective was assessed by comparing the observed incidence of crime after the COVID-19 pandemic was detected in the country with that expected based on ARIMA forecasts based on the pre-pandemic trends. The second objective was assessed by examining the association between crime incidence and the number of passengers on public transport using regressions with ARIMA errors. 

**Results.**
Results indicated that most crime categories decreased significantly after the pandemic was detected in the country or after a national lockdown was instituted. Furthermore, the study found that most of the declines observed were associated with the reductions seen in public transport passenger numbers. However, the declines predicted by the changes in mobility were not always consistent nor as large as those observed. 

**Conclusion.**
The findings contribute to the global evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 on crime and propose a robust method to explictily test whether the changes observed are associated with changes in routine activities.",TRUE,2020-10-27,2020-10-27,2020-10-27T00:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-10-27T12:11:47.732080,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-27,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/4K9DS,available,NA,https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3GF67,prereg_designs,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/citation/,3jfwu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4k9ds/,4k9ds,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f980a4287b7df025a3b349d/,5f980a4287b7df025a3b349d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jfwu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3jfwu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3jfwu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But the approval process is slow and cautious and no vaccine has yet been approved. The faster but perhaps riskier Russian system produced an approved coronavirus vaccine months more quickly, leaving Americans at risk of dying for months longer than Russians. Our data from two national surveys in September show that a majority of Americans would willingly take the existing Russian vaccine and that a two-to-one majority – rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican alike  –  believe that they ought to be allowed to do so. We estimate that making the Russian vaccine immediately available would save approximately 40 to 100 American lives each day after the first month and many more subsequently, To put the matter bluntly, current US government policy will kill some 40 to 100 people each day for a considerable period later this year and early next. To put those deaths in context, all American murderers combined kill only 45 people each day – not a record the US government should wish to emulate. There are also implications for the 2020 election; Since feelings about the Russian coronavirus vaccine are strongly favorable, and the benefits of allowing it in the US are large, making it available should be attractive politically.

rm4ck,preprints,2020-10-20,L’enfer c’est les autres? The effects of COVID-19 virus on interpersonal trust,"Does the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic affect interpersonal trust? While most evidence shows that natural threats reinforce trust and cooperation, the COVID-19 virus differs from other calamities since it spreads through contact with people, thus potentially increasing mistrust and suspicion towards human beings. We in-vestigate the link between exposure to COVID-19 and trust in strangers by conducting a survey experiment with a representative sample of adults in Italy, one the countries that has been worst affected by the outbreak of the virus. Contrary to intuitive expectations, we find that those who report COVID-19 symptoms and those who live in the municipalities that have been worst affected by the virus trust strangers substantially more than their rela-tive counterparts. In addition, our experimental findings reveal that the risk that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to our health in the future leads to a substantial increase in trust in strangers. The risk that the pandemic poses to our livelihood, in terms of job loss and economic recession, also leads to a smaller increase in trust in strangers, while solidarity appeals and knowledge of people with COVID-19 symptoms within a close circle of relatives, friends and colleagues have no effects on trust. These findings, we suggest, could be explained by adapting the “emancipation theory of trust” to the context of natural disasters, conjecturing that when caught in catastrophes people become more dependent on other people’s support.",TRUE,2020-10-20,2020-10-20,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|Interpersonal trust|Natural threats|Trust,2020-10-20T16:17:51.269423,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-20,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/citation/,rm4ck,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8f09e68fc43a00bc8dbf62/,5f8f09e68fc43a00bc8dbf62,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rm4ck/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rm4ck/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rm4ck,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
wuk6a,preprints,2020-10-20,Masks and face coverings for the lay public: A narrative update,"Whether and when to mandate the wearing of masks or face coverings by the public to prevent the spread of Covid-19 remains controversial. We summarise a large research literature across a range of academic disciplines. There is growing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, hence may travel long distances and be inhaled. Infection control policies must therefore go beyond contact and droplet measures (such as hand-washing and cleaning surfaces) and attend more carefully to masking and ventilation. Masks work mainly by source control (protecting others) but give some protection to wearers. Even small reductions in individual transmission with ‘imperfect’ masks and face coverings could lead to large effects on population spread. Randomized controlled trials of the preventive effect of population masking in Covid-19 remain sparse and have not addressed source control. Performance varies widely across different kinds of mask; comfort and fit need to be optimized. Masks may cause discomfort and communication difficulties, which affect some groups (e.g. d/Deaf) disproportionately. The harms of mask-wearing were over-estimated in the early months of the pandemic; there is no evidence that risk compensation occurs in people who wear them or that masks account for significant fomite transmission. Masks do not cause clinically significant physiological decompensation in healthy people. Documented medical exemptions to mask-wearing are few. The psychological impacts of masks are culturally shaped; they may include threats to autonomy, social relatedness and competence. Whilst harms of masks are generally outweighed by benefits when COVID-19 is spreading in a population, mandated masking involves a trade-off with personal freedom, so such policies should be pursued only if the threat is severe and benefits cannot be achieved through less intrusive means.",TRUE,2020-11-17,2020-10-20,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19|face coverings|Masks|public health|SARS-CoV-2,2020-10-20T16:20:35.316256,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-20,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/citation/,wuk6a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8e9a20d265e0006b7dc583/,5f8e9a20d265e0006b7dc583,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wuk6a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wuk6a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wuk6a,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data are drawn from the Canadian Perspective Survey Series 3: Resuming Economic and Social Activities During COVID-19, administered by Statistics Canada in June 2020. Weighted descriptives calculate overall adherence levels and logistic regressions models of each behaviour as a function of demographics and socioeconomic status identify vulnerable segments of the population. We find a nearly universal increase in hand washing (94%) and high adherence to social distancing and avoiding crowds (82% and 84% respectively). Adherence to the use of face masks is much lower (67% on average); moreover, there are significant disparities in their use. Women, older adults, immigrants, and urban residents are much more likely to adhere to mask wearing, and other precautionary behaviours, than men, younger adults, Canadian-born, and rural residents.

Population counts – the principal denominators for calculating age-specific mortality rates – will be subject to noise infusion in the United States with the 2020 Census via a disclosure avoidance system based on differential privacy. Using COVID-19 mortality curves from the CDC, we show that differential privacy will introduce substantial distortion in COVID-19 mortality rates – sometimes causing mortality rates to exceed 100\% -- hindering our ability to understand the pandemic. This distortion is particularly large for population groupings with fewer than 1000 persons – 40\% of all county-level age-sex groupings and 60\% of race groupings.

76me2,preprints,2020-10-15,Mental Health and Economic Concerns from March to May during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada,"Background 
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations worldwide. In this study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic concerns. 
Methods
Analyses were based on two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4,627 in March and 4,600 in May). We described the changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the relationship between the two characteristics.
Results
Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to 52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important correlate of ‘bad’ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status. Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame. 
Conclusions
These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canada’s Emergency Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should be continued throughout the pandemic.",TRUE,2020-10-18,2020-10-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,adults|Canada|COVID-19|economic|mental health,2020-10-18T21:23:02.029901,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-18,FALSE,NA,no,The data are available to Canadian researchers via Statistics Canada’s Data Liberation Initiative and to international researchers by request at dli-idd@statcan.gc.ca from Statistics Canada.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/citation/,76me2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f88bc4037b6bb01ba309281/,5f88bc4037b6bb01ba309281,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/76me2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/76me2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/76me2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

bj3fk,preprints,2020-10-13,Care in times of COVID-19: The impact of the pandemic on informal caregiving in Austria,"Much attention has been paid to the care workforce and care home residents during the COVID-19 crisis, whereas the impact on informal caregivers has remained speculative. In Austria, like in other European countries, informal care is carried out overwhelmingly by (non-cohabiting) relatives. Limited care services available during the crisis, social-distancing, economic uncertainty and competing care needs within households may have changed the profile of informal caregiving and/or increased the psychological strain experienced by caregivers. Focusing on Austria, this study aims to empirically analyse the following research questions: how has the pandemic affected the incidence and intensity of informal caregiving? How has the psychological wellbeing during the first wave of the pandemic compared across different groups of informal caregivers, depending on their gender and parental status? We use a novel representative survey carried out in Austria after the implementation of lockdown measures (June 2020, N=2000). Bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis is applied to a set of survey items dedicated to respondent’s informal caregiving before and after the start of the pandemic and psychological wellbeing. Findings suggest a tightening of care networks, with new carers likely to have stepped in to provide low intensity care to relatively autonomous people. Overall, both prevalence and intensity of informal care did not change significantly (compared to pre-crisis levels). Caregiving was associated with poor psychological outcomes, especially among those without children.

n6f3r,preprints,2020-10-12,How the Far-Right Polarises Twitter: 'Highjacking' Hashtags in Times of COVID-19,"Twitter influences political debates. Phenomena like fake news and hate speech show that political discourse on micro-blogging can become strongly polarised by algorithmic enforcement of selective perception. Some political actors actively employ strategies to facilitate polarisation on Twitter, as past contributions show, via strategies of 'hashjacking'. For the example of COVID-19 related hashtags and their retweet networks, we examine the case of partisan accounts of the German far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and their potential use of 'hashjacking' in May 2020. Our findings indicate that polarisation of political party hashtags has not changed significantly in the last two years. We see that right-wing partisans are actively and effectively polarising the discourse by 'hashjacking' COVID-19 related hashtags, like #CoronaVirusDE or #FlattenTheCurve. This polarisation strategy is dominated by the activity of a limited set of heavy users. The results underline the necessity to understand the dynamics of discourse polarisation, as an active political communication strategy of the far-right, by only a handful of very active accounts.",TRUE,2020-10-12,2020-10-12,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Far-Right|Hashjacking|Hashtag|Networks|Polarisation|Twitter,2020-10-12T17:48:28.801385,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-12,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/citation/,n6f3r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8455faa5e94702e11bc1de/,5f8455faa5e94702e11bc1de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/n6f3r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/n6f3r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n6f3r,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Earlier studies based on seasonal comparisons suggested schooling to equalize social gaps in achievement, but recent replication studies gave rise to skepticism about the validity of older findings. We propose an alternative causal design that identifies schooling exposure effects by exploiting (conditionally) random variation in test dates and birth dates for children participating in assessment studies. We test effects of school exposure in first grade for a series of learning domains (vocabulary, grammar, math, and science) by drawing on recent data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS). Findings clearly indicate that schooling increases learning in all domains and particularly in math and science. However, we did not find any evidence that schooling effects differed by children’s socio-economic background. We conclude that, while all children benefitted by first-grade exposure, first-grade schooling had no consequences for social inequality in learning.

cpkj6,preprints,2020-10-09,“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”:  COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children,"Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. 

Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. 

Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have.

Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19.

Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",TRUE,2020-12-03,2020-10-09,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,conflict|COVID-19|decision-making|family|health|parenthood|relationships|work-family,2020-10-09T18:52:21.886272,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Jessica McCrory Calarco|Emily Meanwell|Elizabeth Anderson|and Amelia Knopf,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/citation/,cpkj6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f8081a3cc246f02537545f6/,5f8081a3cc246f02537545f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cpkj6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cpkj6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cpkj6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Changes in intergenerational non-physical contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic among older people in France, Italy and Spain","Keeping physical distance is intended to mitigate the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face interactions on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are particularly relevant for older people’s mental health implications. Our analyses rely on an on-line representative survey conducted in Italy, Spain and France during April 14-24 2020. We considered the sub-sample of individuals aged 50+ (N=4,207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyse how changes in intergenerational relationships differed by socio-economic factors in the three considered countries and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in physical interactions. Finally, changes in the use of digital devices has been explored as a consequence of both, decreased in physical and increased in non-physical intergenerational contacts.

zst94,preprints,2020-10-08,Factors Affecting COVID-19 Testing Decisions: Social and Economic Heterogeneities in a Representative Sample,"Introduction: Willingness to participate in COVID-19 testing and tracing programs has potential to exacerbate health disparities due to systematic variation by social determinants of health. This study evaluates sociodemographic, economic, and psychological factors associated with COVID-19 testing motivations.
Methods: We used data from the Person to Person Health Interview Study, collected by telephone in April and May 2020, using a representative sample of Indiana residents (n=943). Testing intentions were assessed across six motivations: treatment affordability, ability to work if positive, hospital effectiveness, symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others. Bivariate analyses and ordinal logistic models were used to assess the influence of race/ethnicity, education, financial strain, and COVID-19 worries on each outcome. 
Results: Respondents strongly agree that symptom severity, proximity to infected, and risk of transmitting to others would be important considerations in COVID-19 test decisions. Black and Latino respondents were more likely than white respondents to agree that ability to work if positive (b = 0.48 and 0.96) and hospital effectiveness (b = 0.92 and 0.96) would influence their decision to get tested. Test affordability (b = 2.80), hospital effectiveness (b = 2.00), and risk of transmission (b = 0.99) were considerations among participants reporting financial strain. Desire to reduce transmission (b = 1.49) and concern about proximity to infected (b = 2.66) were reported among those who expressed COVID-19 worries.
Conclusions: In a representative sample in Indiana, people consider their own and others’ vulnerability to COVID-19 in testing decisions. Lower-SES groups and Black and Latino people were more likely to cite resource constraints. Policies expanding financial assistance and prosocial message framing may increase testing rates, particularly among vulnerable subpopulations.",TRUE,2020-10-09,2020-10-09,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|disparities|race and ethnicity|socioeconomic status|testing intentions,2020-10-09T18:41:01.080946,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-09,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,Brea Perry,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/citation/,zst94,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7f752fcc246f01e874deae/,5f7f752fcc246f01e874deae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zst94/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zst94/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zst94,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
2bgqs,preprints,2020-10-07,COVID-19 and the Future of US Fertility: What Can We Learn from Google?,"We use data from Google Trends to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on future births in the United States.  First, we show that periods of above-normal search volume for Google keywords relating to conception and pregnancy in US states are associated with higher numbers of births in the following months. Excess searches for unemployment keywords have the opposite effect.  Second, by employing simple statistical learning techniques, we demonstrate that including information on keyword search volumes in prediction models significantly improves forecast accuracy over a number of cross-validation criteria. Third, we use data on Google searches during the COVID-19 pandemic to predict changes in aggregate fertility rates in the United States at the state level through February 2021.  Our analysis suggests that between November 2020 and February 2021, monthly US births will drop sharply by approximately 15%.  For context, this would be a 50% larger decline than that following the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and similar in magnitude to the declines following the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and the Great Depression.  Finally, we find heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across different types of mothers.  Women with less than a college education, as well as Black or African American women, are predicted to have larger declines in fertility due to COVID-19.

re7sn,preprints,2020-10-06,The Swedish paradox explained? Investigating the role of economic inequality and risk perceptions in the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Economic inequality is understood as a country-level risk factor that increases the spread of infectious diseases. The Novel Coronavirus presents somewhat contradictory evidence of this because the most equal countries in the world experienced deaths per capita as high as the most unequal. We label this the ‘Swedish paradox’. We theorize that inequality has a non-linear association with disease spread because of risk perceptions among the public. Risk perceptions that are extreme in either direction – toward nonchalance or outright panic – lead to behaviors that increase infection1. Highly equal countries like Sweden had very low risk perceptions at the beginning of the pandemic and this may have led to individual and public actions that increase infection risk. To test this, we modeled the role of economic inequality on infection through the mediating role of risk perceptions in April, in 74 countries. We measured the intensity of the outbreak and government interventions in March as key predictors of risk perceptions. This lets us identify ‘over’ or ‘under’ concern and whether these extremes in the distribution of risk perceptions predicts infection increase in May, measured as death rates with an 18-day lead. We find that inequality has a large linear association with risk perceptions in April (0.50 as a standardized [beta] coefficient). We find that risk perceptions in April have a moderate association with infection increase in May (0.24 beta) and these effects are non-linear. Societies below a disposable income inequality Gini of around 31 were prone to slightly more infection in May as a function of less inequality, whereas societies above 31 were prone to much more infection as a function of more inequality, all else equal. This offers some clarification of the Swedish paradox; however, the biggest effects of inequality on infection occur at the upper end of the distribution meaning inequality is only a small piece of this puzzle.",TRUE,2020-10-08,2020-10-08,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|COVIDiSTRESS|Economic Inequality|Government Intervention|Income Inequality|Novel Coronavirus Pandemic|Outbreak Severity|Risk Perceptions|Social Inequality,2020-10-08T01:26:20.627512,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-08,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/nbreznau/Ineq_Risk_Covid,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/citation/,re7sn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7c8e94a5e94700631bdc04/,5f7c8e94a5e94700631bdc04,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/re7sn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/re7sn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/re7sn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

37b8f,preprints,2020-10-06,COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction with Machine Learning,"Several outbreak prediction models for COVID-19 are being used by officials around the world to make informed-decisions and enforce relevant control measures. Among the standard models for COVID-19 global pandemic prediction, simple epidemiological and statistical models have received more attention by authorities, and they are popular in the media. Due to a high level of uncertainty and lack of essential data, standard models have shown low accuracy for long-term prediction. Although the literature includes several attempts to address this issue, the essential generalization and robustness abilities of existing models needs to be improved. This paper presents a comparative analysis of machine learning and soft computing models to predict the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to SIR and SEIR models. Among a wide range of machine learning models investigated, two models showed promising results (i.e., multi-layered perceptron, MLP, and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, ANFIS).

jyvk4,preprints,2020-10-03,“Let’s Not Pretend It’s Fun”:  How COVID-19-Related School and Childcare Closures are Damaging Mothers’ Well-Being,"The COVID-19 pandemic closed schools and childcare centers across the U.S., forcing many parents to care for children at home. While parents generally enjoy time with children and want more “family time,” evidence also suggests that substantial, unanticipated increases in parenting time may negatively impact at least some mothers’ well-being. We investigate this possibility using surveys (N=139) and in-depth interviews (N=65) with mothers of young children in Southern Indiana conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic (April-May 2020). We find that mothers who have greatly increased the time they spend caring for their children also disproportionately report increased stress, anxiety, and frustrations with their children. Our qualitative data reveal that disruptions in childcare arrangements, particularly when coupled with intensive work pressures and/or intensive parenting norms, exacerbate the negative impact of increased parenting time on mothers’ well-being. Meanwhile, other mothers are not experiencing increased parenting time as a substantial source of stress, and some are even experiencing increased parenting time as a source of joy in otherwise difficult times.  We discuss the implications of these findings for research on parenting and its impact on women’s health and labor force participation, as well as for policies to support families during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,2020-12-03,2020-10-04,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,childcare|COVID-19|family|interviews|mental health|mixed methods|motherhood|parenthood|qualitative|stress|time use|unemployment|work-family,2020-10-04T15:28:08.703085,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-10-04,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/citation/,jyvk4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f7858531cfe6901d5cfb00e/,5f7858531cfe6901d5cfb00e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jyvk4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jyvk4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jyvk4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
ejpw7,preprints,2020-10-02,From Populism to the ‘Plandemic’: Why populists believe in COVID-19 conspiracies,"Why are COVID-19 conspiracy theories so prevalent? Particularly, why would some citizens ignore scientific evidence and common logic but, instead, be convinced that COVID-19 was a military experiment or spread by 5G signals? Why would they believe that Bill Gates had anything to do with it? In this contribution, we argue that populism is at the centre of these beliefs, as the complex nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it an ideal playground for populists’ opposition to scientific and political elites. We use Structural Equation Models and panel survey data (n = 823) from the Austrian Corona Panel Project to test this argument. We demonstrate a negative correlation of populist attitudes with both trust in political and scientific institutions, which, in return, negatively relate to COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs. This results in an overall positive relationship of populist attitudes and conspiracy beliefs, above and beyond political ideology.

The COVID-19 pandemic has seen the HE sector (including universities, publishers and funding bodies) enter a period of upheaval that risks reversing such progress. This article demonstrates how the unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the professional and personal lives of groups currently under-represented in academic STEMM is likely to widen and reproduce systemic inequalities already present within these fields. Evidence emerging from the streamlined COVID-19 related funding call indicates a backward step in gender equity when compared to most recent UKRI figures. The lack of data on other protected characteristics makes understanding and mitigating the damage a significant challenge.

This study analyzes the surge in support for the prime minister during the first wave of the coronavirus epidemic in Israel within the framework of the rally effect. Israel was chosen as a case study for two reasons. First, the country was repeatedly polled during the first wave of infection. Second, a special policy that met the requirements for natural experimentation—a strict compartmentalized blockade limited to certain areas—had been in place for a while.

These may be provided by either organized services and sources of informal social support. The latter is especially important since a lack of social support is associated with a lower level of psychological and physical well-being. During the Covid-19 pandemic, social support for the elderly has proven to be even more crucial, also due to physical distancing. Therefore, this study aims to identify and describe the various types of personal social support networks of the elderly population during the coronavirus pandemic. To this end, a survey of Slovenians older than 64 years was conducted from April 25 to May 4, 2020 on a probability Web-panel-based sample (n = 605). The ego-networks were clustered by a hierarchical clustering approach for symbolic data. Clustering was performed for different types of social support (socializing, instrumental support, emotional support) and different characteristics of the social support networks (i.e., type of relationship, number of contacts, geographical distance). The results show that most of the elderly population in Slovenia have a satisfactory social support network, while the share of those without any (accessible) source of social support is significant.

For this purpose, we conduct a survey in Germany in which we ask ourselves whether this “time is different” from the willingness to be vaccinated against infection by influenza viruses. Our sample does not only comprise students with and without healthcare background, we also analyze a notable amount of healthcare professionals. We find that healthcare professionals exhibit a considerably greater willingness to vaccinate against flu than healthcare and non-healthcare students. In contrast, the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is quite similar among the populations.

Using administration records - marriage certificates and applications - gathered from settings representing a variety of COVID-19 experiences in the United States, we compare counts of recorded marriages in 2020 against those from the same period in 2019. We find a dramatic decrease in year-to-date cumulative marriages in 2020 compared to 2019 in each case. Similar patterns are observed for the Seattle metropolitan area when we analyze the cumulative number of marriage applications, a leading indicator of marriages in the near future. Year-to-date declines in marriage are unlikely to be solely due to closure of government agencies that administer marriage certification or reporting delays.

Workers’ frustrations demonstrate that challenges remain for work designs in increasingly “hybrid” collaboration, wherein some people work face-to-face with others who work remotely. Fortunately, Buchanan’s four orders of design present a framework for improving virtual forms of collaboration in conjunction with management and information systems scholarship. Here, we review the latest knowledge from these disciplines on virtual collaboration through the lens of the four orders of design.

Many believe that the loss of childcare and homeschooling requirements are key contributors to this trend, but previous work has been unable to test these hypotheses due to data limitations. This study uses novel data from 989 partnered, US parents to empirically examine whether the loss of childcare and new homeschooling demands are associated with employment outcomes early in the pandemic. We also consider whether the division of childcare prior to the pandemic is associated with parents’ employment. For parents with young children, the loss of full-time childcare was associated with an increased risk of unemployment for mothers but not fathers. Yet, father involvement in childcare substantially buffered against negative employment outcomes for mothers of young children. For parents with school-age children, participation in homeschooling was associated with adverse employment outcomes for mothers but not fathers. Overall, this study provides empirical support for the current discourse on gender differences in employment during the pandemic and also highlights the role fathers can play in buffering against reduced labor force participation among mothers.",TRUE,2021-02-10,2020-09-12,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,childcare|COVID19|division of labor|homeschooling|parents' employment,2020-09-12T11:12:40.681539,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-12,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/citation/,gwkzx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f5b7fdc2c735500b5ea19ae/,5f5b7fdc2c735500b5ea19ae,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwkzx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwkzx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwkzx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

k7qe9,preprints,2020-09-10,Countries Embracing Maternal Employment Have Opened Schools Sooner after COVID-19 Lockdowns,"Covid-19 pandemic related school closures have affected the majority of the world’s students and remain a contentious issue. Using data from the UNESCO school data base, the ISSP 2012, and country-level panel regressions, we leverage simultaneous school closures during first-wave Covid-19 lockdowns to estimate the effect of gender ideology on school reopening schedules. We show that societal gender ideology likely has influenced school reopening policies: Societies with more supportive attitudes toward maternal employment have reopened schools significantly sooner, and at higher intensities, than societies with less supportive attitudes toward maternal employment, relative to other reopening measures, and net of infection rates. Our findings suggest a causal effect of gender ideological beliefs on pandemic-related school-closure policies. We test and exclude a variety of potential confounders such as a country’s maternal employment rate, GDP, social spending, and cultural values toward children. We argue that school closures may be perceived as less problematic in countries where more people support the ideal of a stay-at-home mom. Gender attitudes may thus represent a set of ideas that affect policy-makers’ decision-making via a potential gender ideology bias. However, the specific underlying mechanisms via which the gender ideology effect operates at the policy-maker level remain untested for in our study, and should be investigated by future research.",TRUE,2021-04-16,2020-09-11,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,containment measures|COVID-19|gender ideology|gender ideology bias|gender role attitudes|school closures,2020-09-11T12:26:09.301096,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-11,FALSE,NA,no,Details on how to access the data are in the Appendix of the manuscript and in the replication files.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/citation/,k7qe9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xh5zc/,xh5zc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f59dd431e8b9c0020e992f6/,5f59dd431e8b9c0020e992f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k7qe9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k7qe9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k7qe9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
mwd7q,preprints,2020-09-09,Use of Unofficial Newspaper Data for COVID-19 Death Surveillance,"Objective. To highlight the critical importance of unofficially reported newspaper-based deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)–like illness (CLI) together with officially confirmed death counts to support improvements in COVID-19 death surveillance.
Methods. Both hospital-based official COVID-19 and unofficial CLI death counts were collected from daily newspapers between March 8 and August 22, 2020. We performed both exploratory and time-series analyses to understand the influence of combining newspaper-based CLI death counts with confirmed hospital death counts on the trends and forecasting of COVID-19 death counts. An autoregressive integrated moving average–based approach was used to forecast the number of weekly death counts for six weeks ahead.
Results. Between March 8 and August 22, 2020, 2,156 CLI deaths were recorded based on newspaper reporting for a count that was 55% of the officially confirmed death count (n = 3,907). This shows that newspaper reports tend to cover a significant number of COVID-19 related deaths. Our forecast also indicates an approximate total of 406 CLI expected for the six weeks ahead, which could contribute to a total of 2,413 deaths including 2,007 confirmed deaths expected from August 23 to October 3, 2020.
Conclusions. Analyzing existing trends in and forecasting the expected number of newspaper-based CLI deaths indicates yet-unreported COVID-19 death counts, which could be a critical source to estimate provisional COVID-19 death counts and mortality surveillance.

Considering unofficial newspaper-based CLI death counts is essential to identify COVID-19 death severity and surveillance needs to advance public health research efforts to prepare appropriate response strategies for low- and middle-income countries.",TRUE,2020-09-11,2020-09-11,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19-Like-Illness (CLI) Death|Mortality Surveillance|Newspaper-based Surveillance|Official Hospital Data,2020-09-11T09:20:00.916704,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-11,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/mazbahulahamad,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/citation/,mwd7q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f592c779fdada02729eee84/,5f592c779fdada02729eee84,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mwd7q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mwd7q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mwd7q,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
bxm9g,preprints,2020-09-09,Cause for concerns: gender inequality in experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany,"COVID-19 is having a tremendous impact on gender relations, as care needs have been magnified due to schools and day-care closures. Using topic modeling on over 1,100 open reports from a survey fielded during the first four weeks of the lockdown in Germany, we shed light on how personal experiences of the lockdown differ between women and men. Our results show that, in general, people were most concerned about social contacts and childcare. However, we find clear differences among genders: women worried more about childcare while men were more concerned about paid work and the economy. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting women more heavily than men not only at the physical level of work (e.g. women are reducing more paid work hours than men), but also through increasing the division regarding the cognitive level of work (e.g. women are more worried about childcare work while men are about paid work).

Unfortunately, previous research suggests that many Americans plan to refuse a vaccine; thereby jeopardizing collective immunity. We investigate the effectiveness of three different health communication frames hypothesized to increase vaccine intention; emphasizing either (1) personal health risks, (2) economic costs, or (3) collective public health consequences of not vaccinating.

Methods:  In a large (N = 7,064) and demographically representative survey experiment, we randomly assigned respondents to read pro-vaccine communication materials featuring one of the frames listed above. We also randomly varied the message source (ordinary people vs. medical experts) and availability of information designed the “pre-bunk” concerns about expedited clinical trial safety.

Findings: We find that messages emphasizing the personal health risks and collective health consequences of not vaccinating significantly increase Americans’ intentions to vaccinate. These effects are similar in magnitude irrespective of message source, and the inclusion of pre-bunking information. Surprisingly, economic cost frames have no discernible effect on vaccine intention.

nkhef,preprints,2020-09-07,Making Sense of Algorithms: Relational Perception of Contact Tracing and Risk Assessment during COVID-19,"Governments, institutions, and citizens of nearly every nation have been compelled to respond to COVID-19. Many measures have been adopted, including contact tracing and risk assessment, whereby citizen whereabouts are constantly monitored to trace contact with other infectious individuals and isolate contagious parties via algorithmic evaluation of their risk status. This paper investigates how citizens make sense of Health Code (jiankangma), the contact tracing and risk assessment algorithm in China. We probe how people accept or resist the algorithm by examining their ongoing, dynamic, and relational interactions with it over time. By seeking a deeper, iterative understanding of how individuals accept or resist the algorithm, our data unearths three key sites of concern. First, how understandings of algorithmic surveillance shape and are shaped by notions of privacy, including fatalism towards the possibility of true privacy in China and a trade-off narrative between privacy and twin imperatives of public and economic health. Second, how trust in the algorithm is mediated by the perceived competency of the technology, the veracity of input data, and well-publicized failures in both data collection and analysis. Third, how the implementation of Health Code in social life alters beliefs about the algorithm, such as its further role after COVID-19 passes, or contradictory and disorganized enforcement measures upon risk assessment.

Many measures have been adopted, including contact tracing and risk assessment algorithms, whereby citizen whereabouts are monitored to trace contact with other infectious individuals in order to generate a risk status via algorithmic evaluation. Based on 38 in-depth interviews, we investigate how people make sense of Health Code (jiankangma), the Chinese contact tracing and risk assessment algorithmic sociotechnical assemblage. We probe how people accept or resist Health Code by examining their ongoing, dynamic, and relational interactions with it. Participants display a rich variety of attitudes toward privacy and surveillance, ranging from fatalism to the possibility of privacy to trade-offs for surveillance in exchange for public health, which is mediated by the perceived effectiveness of Health Code and changing views on the intentions of institutions who deploy it. We show how perceived competency varies not just on how well the technology works, but on the social and cultural enforcement of various non-technical aspects like quarantine, citizen data inputs, and cell reception.

khtwr,preprints,2020-09-07,Motivated Reasoning and Blame: Responses to Performance Framing and Outgroup Triggers during COVID-19,"To manage citizen evaluations of government performance, public officials use blame avoidance strategies when communicating performance information. We examine two prominent presentational strategies: scapegoating and spinning, while testing how public responses vary depending on whether they are ideologically aligned with the public official. We examine these relationships in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Trump administration sought to shift blame by scapegoating outgroups (by using the term “Chinese virus”), and framing performance information on COVID-19 testing in positive terms. Using a novel pre-registered survey experiment that incorporates open and close-ended items, we offer three main findings. First, there is clear evidence of motivated reasoning: conservatives rate the performance of the Trump administration more positively and are more apt to blame prominent Democrats, Chinese residents and the Chinese Government. Second, performance information framing was found to impact blame attribution among conservatives, but only for open-ended responses. Third, while exposure to the term “Chinese virus” increased blame assigned to Chinese residents among all participants, conservatives exposed to the term appeared to blame President Trump more, suggesting repeated use of divisive blame shifting strategies may alienate even supporters.",TRUE,2020-09-08,2020-09-08,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-09-08T08:07:43.857295,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-08,FALSE,NA,no,Paper is under peer review and will be made public after.

e6msz,preprints,2020-09-01,U.S. Regional Disparities in Physical Distancing: Evaluating Racial and Socioeconomic Divides During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract

Health varies by U.S. region of residence. Despite regional heterogeneity in the outbreak of COVID-19, regional differences in physical distancing behaviors over time are relatively unknown. This study examines regional variation in physical distancing trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigates variation by race and socioeconomic status (SES) within regions.

Data from the 2015-2019 five-year American Community Survey were matched with anonymized location pings data from over 20 million mobile devices (SafeGraph, Inc.) at the Census block group level. We visually present trends in the stay-at-home proportion by Census region, race, and SES throughout 2020 and conduct regression analyses to statistically examine these patterns.

From March to December, the stay-at-home proportion was highest in the Northeast (0.25 in March to 0.35 in December) and lowest in the South (0.24 to 0.30). Across all regions, the stay-at-home proportion was higher in block groups with a higher percentage of Blacks, as Blacks disproportionately live in urban areas where stay-at-home rates were higher (0.009 [CI: 0.008, 0.009]). In the South, West, and Midwest, higher-SES block groups stayed home at the lowest rates pre-pandemic; however, this trend reversed throughout March before converging in the months following. In the Northeast, lower-SES block groups stayed home at comparable rates to higher-SES block groups during the height of the pandemic but diverged in the months following. 

Differences in physical distancing behaviors exist across U.S. regions, with a pronounced Southern and rural disadvantage. Results can be used to guide reopening and COVID-19 mitigation plans.",TRUE,2021-04-30,2020-09-03,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Regional disparities|Social distancing|Socioeconomic Disparities,2020-09-03T08:24:42.117036,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-03,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/citation/,e6msz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4e887a0f9a080171ad92fa/,5f4e887a0f9a080171ad92fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e6msz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e6msz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e6msz,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we used COVID-19 outbreak stages as natural experiments to investigate individual behavioural changes of greenspace use before and during the pandemic. Our case cities are Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We extracted panel data which consisted of longitudinal posts of 100, 232 users, being posted in 1,185 greenspaces in the four Asian cities. Our statistical models found a 5.3% increase in the odds of people using greenspaces for every 100 additional weekly new cases.

adm36,preprints,2020-09-01,Sickness-related Absences During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Occupations,"During the pandemic, work is exposing many workers to extensive health risks, with workplace infections a major source of COVID-19 outbreaks. The experience of work is substantially different by occupation, and “essential” occupations consist of disproportionately low-SES and non-White workers. Documenting occupational health disparities during the pandemic is therefore crucial for understanding COVID-19 health inequalities in the United States. This study uses the Current Population Survey microdata combined with occupational data from multiple sources to estimate occupational differences in sickness-related absences from work in March – June 2020 and their contribution to income, educational, and racial/ethnic differences in health inequalities. We find that there has been an unprecedented rise in absences compared to previous years, highly concentrated in transportation, food-related, and personal-care and service occupations. In areas with a major COVID-19 outbreak, these occupations saw rates of absence 6 times higher than all non-healthcare professional occupations. Occupations with the greatest increase in absences are those that are unsuitable for remote work, require workers to work in close proximity to others, pay low wages and rarely provide health insurance. These occupations are, on average, disproportionately non-White, immigrant, low-SES, and have workers in worse than average health. We show that occupation contributes 41% of the total of Black/White differences in absences, 40% of high-low income differences, and 54% of differences between college graduates and those with at most a high school diploma.",TRUE,2020-09-01,2020-09-01,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|health disparities|inequality|job characteristics|occupations|race and ethnicity|SES|workplace,2020-09-01T09:45:23.151304,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-01,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://cps.ipums.org/cps/,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/citation/,adm36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4dbb340f9a08010dadadab/,5f4dbb340f9a08010dadadab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adm36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adm36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adm36,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

During the COVID-19 pandemic, different population groups may have been adapted to varying levels of screen time, which may have profound implications on their health and wellbeing. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally.

The interdisciplinary nature of how geographic and spatial analysis was used in COVID-19 research was noticeable among the reviewed papers. Although GIS has substantial potential in planning to slow down the spread, surveillance, contact tracing, and identify the trends and hotspots of breakdowns, it was not employed as much as it could have been.

ykc6w,preprints,2020-08-27,Modelling COVID-19 mortality at the regional level in Italy,"Italy was harshly hit by COVID-19, registering more than 35,000 deaths between February and July, 2020. The virus spread unequally across the country, with northern regions witnessing more cases and deaths than those in the centre and south. We investigate demographic and socio-economic factors that contributed to the diverse regional impact of the virus in Italy. Within a smoothing framework, we divide regions into three well-defined groups of High, Middle and Low mortality by cluster analysis. Extending the Poisson regression model to account for regional clusters, we find that COVID-mortality is positively associated with the share of ICU utilization, GDP per capita, proportion of the older population and the number of COVID-19 positive cases, while it is negatively associated with the delay of region-specific outbreaks and the number of tests performed.

9fmj6,preprints,2020-08-27,"New blood donors in times of crisis: Increased donation willingness, particularly among people at high risk for attracting SARS-CoV-2","BACKGROUND
Traditionally, during crises the number of new blood donors increases. However, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created additional barriers to donate due to governmental prevention measures and increased personal health risks. In this report, we examined how the pandemic affected new donor registrations in the Netherlands, especially among groups with higher risk profiles for severe COVID-19. Additionally, we explored the role of media for blood donation and new donor registrations.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS
We analyzed new donor registrations and attention for blood donation in newspapers and on social media from January until May 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2017 to 2019.
RESULTS
After the introduction of nationwide prevention measures, several peaks in new donor registrations occurred, which coincided with peaks in media attention. Interestingly, people with a higher risk profile for COVID-19 (e.g. due to age or region of residence) were overrepresented among new registrants.
DISCUSSION
In sum, the first peak of the current pandemic has led to increased new blood donor registrations, despite the associated increased health risks. Time and future studies will have to tell whether these new donors are one-off ‘pandemic’ donors or if they will become regular, loyal donors.",TRUE,2021-02-16,2020-08-27,NA,10.1111/trf.16334,TRUE,FALSE,blood donation|blood donor|COVID-19|crisis|media|newspaper|pandemic|public goods|SARS-CoV2|social media,2020-08-27T10:57:16.095078,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-27,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/bxmyk/,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,the authors,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/citation/,9fmj6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bxmyk/,bxmyk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f475f75bacde8034933cd05/,5f475f75bacde8034933cd05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fmj6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9fmj6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9fmj6,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16334,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
kxmw7,preprints,2020-08-26,Can a COVID-19 Vaccine Live up to Americans’ Expectations?  A Conjoint Analysis of how Vaccine Characteristics Influence Vaccination Intentions,"Objective: A vaccine for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could prove critical in establishing herd immunity. While past work has documented the prevalence and correlates of vaccine refusal, I assess how a less explored topic --  properties of vaccines themselves (e.g., national origin, efficacy, risk of side effects) -- might influence vaccination intentions. This information can help public health officials preempt differential vaccine demand, and inform health communication campaigns that encourage vaccine uptake. 

Rationale: Previous research suggests that Americans should be more likely to intend to vaccinate if presented with a US-made vaccine that carries a low risk of minor side effects, is highly effective, is administered in just one dose, and has spent significant time in development.

Methods: I administered a conjoint experiment (N = 5,940 trials) in a demographically representative survey (N = 990) of US adults to assess how variation in vaccine properties influence self-reported public vaccination intentions.

Results: I find that respondents prefer vaccines that are US-made, over 90% effective, and carry a less than 1% risk of minor side effects. This is potentially problematic, as some leading vaccine candidates are produced outside the US, and may be less effective and more likely to produce minor side effects than respondents would otherwise prefer. Worryingly, intended vaccine refusal rates exceed 30% for a vaccine meeting these optimal characteristics. Encouragingly, though, Americans show no clear preference for vaccines administered in one dose, or developed in under a year, and do not appear to draw a distinction between weakened viral vs. mRNA-based vaccines.

Conclusion: Americans’ preferences for a novel coronavirus vaccine may be at odds with the vaccine that ultimately hits the market, posing both policy and health communication challenges  for vaccination uptake.",TRUE,2020-12-21,2020-08-27,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-08-27T04:58:41.050910,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-27,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/fjuap/,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/citation/,kxmw7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vgs5u/,vgs5u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f466641d4c60300501fde0e/,5f466641d4c60300501fde0e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxmw7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kxmw7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kxmw7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

rn9xk,preprints,2021-04-29,Statistically Validated Indices for COVID-19 Public Health Policies,"In this paper we present six new indices generated from a Bayesian measurement model that allow us to combine policy data from two of the most comprehensive COVID-19 policy datasets, the CoronaNet COVID-19 Government Response Event Dataset and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. By doing so we can validate both independent sources of data and provide more information than either dataset on its own. We estimate these time-varying indices with summary scores for each day from January 1st, 2020 to January 15th, 2021 for over 180 countries and six policy categories: social distancing policies, school-related policies, business-related policies, health monitoring policies, health resources policies and mask-related policies. We also estimate models that predict these indices with a range of social, public health, political and economic covariates. Our results show that business restrictions and social distancing restrictions are strongly associated with reduced general anxiety while school restrictions much less so. Furthermore, school restrictions are associated with higher rates of personal contact with people outside the home, higher levels of income inequality and bureaucratic corruption.

bu45a,preprints,2020-08-24,The pathway from distrusting Western actors to non-compliance with public health guidance during the COVID-19 crisis in Romania,"Global crises provide a fertile environment for the proliferation of disinformation, rumors, and conspiracy narratives.  
We investigate people's perceptions and beliefs related to COVID-19 in Romania, during the lockdown period (April 2020) and during the state of alert period (July 2020), by fielding two surveys with different modes of collection (CATI and web). Building on measures tested in other countries, we identify the public’s vulnerability to conspiracy narratives and its willingness to comply with public health guidance. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we check if individuals exhibiting pro-Russian or anti-Western attitudes believe more strongly in COVID-19 conspiracy narratives compared to the rest of the population. Then, we check if those believing conspiracy narratives are less susceptible to comply with public health recommendations.
We find in both surveys that holding conspiracy beliefs is a mediator between distrusting Western actors and noncompliance with COVID-19 guidelines. Thus, pro-Russian and anti-EU, U.S. and NATO attitudes are linked to stronger conspiracy beliefs, which relate to lower levels of concern and knowledge regarding the virus, which in turn can reduce compliance with guidelines. This suggests that openness to anti-Western narratives may have behavioral consequences. These findings highlight the potential sources of unsafe behaviors during the pandemic and can inform official communication strategies meant to counter both disinformation and non-compliance with public health policies.",TRUE,2020-08-24,2020-08-24,2020-08-23T21:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-08-24T11:49:40.791499,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-24,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,Vlad Achimescu,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/citation/,bu45a,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f4380daf579150187ea5d5d/,5f4380daf579150187ea5d5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu45a/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bu45a/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bu45a,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
nfm5j,preprints,2020-08-21,Staging Science: Authoritativeness and Fragility of Models and Measurement in the COVID-19 Crisis,"n the COVID‐19 crisis, society pins its hopes on science to play an authoritative role in reducing uncertainty and ambiguity. But is science up to the task? This is far from self‐evident. The demands on science in times of crisis run counter to the values of good, normal science. Crisis science needs to be fast, univocal, personalized, and direct, while normal science is slow, contentious, collective, and sensitive to complexity.

p69sk,preprints,2020-08-20,A mixed-method analysis of Facebook posts on the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The advent of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has renewed the debate about the credibility of health information shared across social network sites, (SNS), such as Facebook. Despite these concerns, empirical studies into the reliability and accuracy of Facebook posts are largely limited. The objective of this study is to judge the accuracy and reliability of COVID-19-related  information shared on Facebook using a mixed methodology. The authors extracted Facebook posts (text and embedded video links) in English from Buzzsumo between March 11, 2020, to April 31, 2020, using predetermined keywords. The first 50 posts pertaining to each keyword were extracted and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, Tukey test for post hoc analysis, and modified DISCERN score. A qualitative content analysis was then conducted to contextualize the data. 196 posts were included in the analysis, with 24,084,564 shares and 3,436,275 comments. Useful posts had higher interactions compared to misleading and irrelevant posts (p &lt; 0.05). The mean mDISCERN score for reliability was 3.2/5 for useful videos. The majority of the posts (56%) comprised positive appeals.

This article analyses the historical and structural reasons behind the relative success of Germany and the problems experienced in Britain and the US during the first wave of the pandemic. It also asks why recent international surveys overestimated Anglo-American preparedness. The article argues that the answer lies in the different evolution of public health systems as well as varying public health capacities at the local level. In Germany, post-1994 reforms of the decentralised public health system managed to overcome decades of political neglect and underinvestment and strengthen federal integration without compromising public health capacity at the state and communal level. This joint strengthening of the centre and hinterland allowed the Robert Koch Institute to function as an effective coordinating hub for locally tailored COVID-19 responses. By contrast, the decades after 1970 saw world-renowned Anglo-American public health systems face increasing challenges posed by funding cuts, privatisation, overambitious reforms, and increasing loss of political autonomy. Both the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health England retained significant prestige, which resulted in an overestimation of capacity by international reviews.

z3v2h,preprints,2020-08-17,Adaptation and resilience of commercial fishers in the Northeastern United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Commercial fisheries globally experienced numerous and significant perturbations during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting the livelihoods of millions of fishers worldwide. In the Northeastern United States, fishers grappled with low prices and disruptions to export and domestic markets, leaving many tied to the dock, while others found ways to adapt to the changing circumstances brought about by the pandemic. This paper investigates the short-term impacts of the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-June 2020) on commercial fishers in the Northeast U.S. to understand the effects of the pandemic on participation in the fishery and fishers’ economic outcomes, using data collected from an online survey of 258 Northeast U.S. commercial fishers. This research also assesses characteristics of those fishers who continued fishing and their adaptive strategies to the changing circumstances. Analysis of survey responses found the majority of fishers continued fishing during the early months of the pandemic, while a significant number had stopped fishing. Nearly all reported a loss of income, largely driven by disruptions of export markets, the loss of restaurant sales, and a resulting decline in seafood prices. Landings data demonstrate that while fishing pressure in 2020 was reduced for some species, it remained on track with previous years for others. Fishers reported engaging in a number of adaptation strategies, including direct sales of seafood, switching species, and supplementing their income with government payments or other sources of income. Many fishers who had stopped fishing indicated plans to return, suggesting refraining from fishing as a short-term adaptation strategy, rather than a plan to permanently stop fishing. Despite economic losses, fishers in the Northeastern U.S. demonstrated resilience in the face of the pandemic by continuing to fish and implementing other adaptation strategies rather than switching to other livelihoods.",TRUE,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|COVID-19|fisheries|livelihoods|resilience,2020-08-18T07:29:41.662176,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18,FALSE,NA,no,"Survey data contain sensitive and confidential data on human subjects.

hg9tq,preprints,2020-08-17,Structural Shockwaves: Consecutive Crises and Professional Mobility Among Judges and Prosecutors,"[PRESENTED AT ECPR GENERAL CONFERENCE, AUG 24-28, 2020] It is almost clichéd to speak of a Europe of crises, in which endless onslaughts (financial, migration, secession, plague) push the continent ever closer to collapse. But why should successive shocks be additive? Can the first shock dampen the second? By empirically investigating the professional mobility of judges and prosecutors in Romania over two consecutive crises – the 2017-2019 judicial reforms, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic – this article shows that a first shock can make a social structure more structurally robust to subsequent blows, while contextually amplifying the effects of secondary shocks. Methodologically, this article introduces the open-source Romanian Judicial Professions (1978-2020) database. Theoretically, it contributes to the study of consecutive crises by proposing a new concept, “structural shockwaves,” and uncovering two emergent phenomena associated with sequential structural shockwaves – undertow and rip-currents.",TRUE,2020-09-18,2020-08-18,2020-08-17T04:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|judicial independence|mobility|professions|Romania|social theory,2020-08-18T07:28:00.995668,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/gfjke/,no,"Exploratory, rapid-response research, preregistration not applicable.",NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/citation/,hg9tq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gfjke/,gfjke,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3aa858d42ad40143cda3f5/,5f3aa858d42ad40143cda3f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hg9tq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hg9tq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hg9tq,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Inequality in Digital Preparedness of Students and Schools before the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disordered the educational process across the globe, as schools suddenly had to provide their teaching in an online environment. One question that raised immediate concern is the potential effects of this forced and rapid digitalization on inequalities in the learning process by social class, migration background and sex. Elaborating on the literature on the digital divide, we study inequalities in digital preparedness of students and schools, before the pandemic took place. Using data from the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) on seven countries, and the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) on 45 countries, both from 2018, we demonstrate that schools and students vary in their preparedness for digital education, but that school variation is not systematically related to the student composition by socioeconomic and migration background. More important drivers for a digital divide in corona-times are the ICT skills students have, which are strongly related to socioeconomic background (known as the second level of the digital divide). We found little evidence for a hypothesized ‘fourth level’ of the digital divide, which would result from social gradients in the preparedness of school environments for digital education.",TRUE,2020-08-18,2020-08-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,country comparisons|COVID-19|Education|inequality|teachers,2020-08-18T07:27:10.069681,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-18,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/icils/2018|http://www.oecd.org/education/talis/,available,NA,https://osf.io/ajfxk/,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/citation/,58d6p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f3a9a2825e5dc0152c9311d/,5f3a9a2825e5dc0152c9311d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/58d6p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/58d6p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/58d6p,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

scqxw,preprints,2020-08-16,Disequilibrium and COVID-19: Effectively Applying Crisis Intervention,"Crisis intervention is widely understood as a response to life-threatening emergencies and therefore often limited in its application to natural disasters, severe physical violence, suicidal ideation, and similarly dangerous incidents. While crisis intervention is appropriate for these scenarios, historical definitions of crisis suggest the term and related interventions have much broader application. The ramifications of the novel coronavirus and related cultural fallout increase vulnerability and impair coping capacity in such a way that individuals are significantly more likely to enter crisis states, demanding a prompt reconsideration of the breadth of this practice technique. Successful application of crisis intervention reduces the long-term psychological implications for individuals encountering sudden loss, unexpected traumas, and other hazards that overwhelm traditional coping strategies, outcomes all made more likely by this pandemic. Crisis intervention is a structured, time-limited, problem-oriented treatment modality that is well suited to a remote practice environment because it is directive in its approach and requires few contacts at a time when client access is potentially limited. This paper examines the course of crisis with or without intervention, assessment and intervention tactics, social work values when applying crisis intervention, and the implications of the use of this modality as it relates to COVID-19.",TRUE,2020-08-17,2020-08-17,2020-08-16T04:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,coping|coronavirus|COVID-19|crisis|crisis intervention|disequilibrium,2020-08-17T03:46:01.160442,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-17,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work,Stephen J.

Using the latest COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we aim to: a) assess one dimension of reporting quality-- data completeness; and b) examine national time-trends in the age pattern of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths overall as well as by race and ethnicity.

4gyxn,preprints,2020-08-10,Mutating mobilisations during the pandemic crisis in Spain,"For a social movement and urban scholar, these are not the best days for 
conducting fieldwork on the streets. Off-line demonstrations, protests with 
gathering bodies and banners, deliberative assemblies and the like have been on 
hold for a long period in countries such as Spain. The coronavirus pandemic and 
the stringent measures taken by the government have set an unprecedented 
situation in terms of social life and politics, especially for the generations who 
did not live under the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1978), where surveillance 
and repression determined daily routines and anti-regime mobilisations. The 
current ruling coalition between the social democratic party, PSOE, and the 
more leftist Unidas Podemos, had opened up a promising term for, at least, 
some progressive policies since they took office in January 2020. However, the 
sudden economic crisis that the pandemic is unfolding has abruptly 
undermined even the least optimistic prospects. 
As a regular online observer of bottom-up organisations, campaigns, and 
collective actions, as well as a follower of the debates that stir and flood the 
political sphere in Spain, I was surprised by some of the innovative ways of 
continuing to protest during these difficult times of home confinement, starting 
March 15, 2020, when the government declared a state of emergency. 
Obviously, online protests are not new at all but, in this short period of time, 
activists explored appealing forms of articulating discourse and campaigns. 
Grassroots mobilisations for social justice have included practices and 
challenges to the authorities previously unforeseen. In particular, the following 
selection of experiences resembles the context of the 2008 global financial 
crisis, although some dimensions have changed too. Hence, this preliminary 
analysis aims at understanding what seems like the first stage of an emerging 
cycle of mutating mobilisations.",TRUE,2020-08-15,2020-08-15,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,covid-19 pandemic|social movements|Spain,2020-08-15T21:40:56.536638,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-15,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/citation/,4gyxn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f31728d75d29f00da17399f/,5f31728d75d29f00da17399f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gyxn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4gyxn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4gyxn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Until the peak of the pandemic, the physical infrastructure of lower-income neighborhoods was the key reason why COVID-19 spread faster in these neighborhoods.

2kfs6,preprints,2020-08-08,Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of COVID-19: A Classification Scheme,"Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear.” Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life.

h9gaw,preprints,2020-08-08,Automation and Labour in India: Policy Implications of Job Polarisation pre and post COVID-19 crisis,"Advancements in ICTs have heightened the potential of such technology to automate jobs and render labour redundant en masse, uniting the concerns of sociologists, policy makers, and economists alike. Realistically, however, concern revolves not around redundancy of labour, but the polarising effect automation exerts on jobs. This polarisation stems from the claim that automation 'hollows out' mid-skill jobs, thereby increasing demand for high- and low- skill jobs. Job polarisation widens wage disparity, lowers the aggregate skill level of labour and exacerbates existing social inequalities. Proponents of laissez-faire automation argue that while automation may exert adverse effects on labour in the short run, it is bound to realise higher net benefits and employment in the long run. Such an understanding which is based on the Schumpterian notion of creative destruction is predicated on the fact that firms would adopt only such technology which bring about substantial strides in productivity. However, world over and in India firms have been merely substituting labour with capital, without any greater efficiency gains. This trend is only set to worsen with the ongoing health crisis due to varied reasons. In such a situation, it becomes imperative to design novel methods of social security.",TRUE,2020-08-11,2020-08-11,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,automation|indian labour market|jobless recovery|job polarisation|labour|social security|technological unemployment,2020-08-11T07:07:08.132188,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-11,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76def|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Other Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/citation/,h9gaw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2e42a8479288006b85f192/,5f2e42a8479288006b85f192,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h9gaw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h9gaw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h9gaw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In doing so, this study develops and uses the SD model that reproduced similar patterns in terms of GDP, poverty, and unemployment. Estimated unemployment and estimated poverty under the COVID-19 are calculated for three different economic scenarios: the optimistic, the mid, and the pessimistic scenarios. This study concludes that Indonesia will experience rising unemployment and poverty in ranges (9-10) and (25-26) million people respectively by the end of this year – depending on projected economy growths.

yxdc5,preprints,2020-08-07,The Economic Consequences of R=1: Towards a Workable Behavioural Epidemiological Model of Pandemics,"This paper reviews the literature on incorporating behavioural elements into epidemiological models of pandemics. While modelling behaviour by forward-looking rational agents can provide some insight into the time paths of pandemics, the non-stationary nature of Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) models of viral spread makes characterisation of resulting equilibria difficult. Here I posit a shortcut that can be deployed to allow for a tractable equilibrium model of pandemics with intuitive comparative statics and also a clear prediction that effective reproduction numbers (that is, R) will tend towards 1 in equilibrium. This motivates taking R=1 as an equilibrium starting point for analyses of pandemics with behavioural agents.

b5hj3,preprints,2020-08-05,Creatures of the state? Metropolitan counties compensated for state inaction in initial U.S. response to COVID-19 pandemic,"Societal responses to crises require coordination at multiple levels of organization. Exploring early efforts to contain COVID-19 in the U.S., we argue that local governments can act to ensure systemic resilience and recovery when higher-level governments fail to do so. Event history analyses show that large, more urban areas experience COVID-19 more intensely due to high population density and denser socioeconomic networks. But metropolitan counties were also among the first to adopt shelter-in-place orders. Analyzing the statistical predictors of when counties moved before their states, we find that the hierarchy of counties by size and economic integration matters for the timing of orders, where both factors predict earlier shelter-in-place orders. In line with sociological theories of urban governance, we also find evidence of an important governance dimension to the timing of orders. Liberal counties in conservative states were more than twice as likely to adopt a policy and implement one earlier in the pandemic, suggesting that tensions about how to resolve collective governance problems are important in the socio-temporal dynamic of responses to COVID-19. We explain this behavior as a substitution effect in which more urban local governments, driven by risk and necessity, step up into the action vacuum left by higher levels of government and become national policy leaders and innovators.",TRUE,2021-01-07,2020-08-06,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Cities|Compensation|Counties|COVID-19|Diffusion|Government response|Local government|Public policy|States|Urban governance|Urban science|USA,2020-08-06T13:32:20.635894,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-08-06,FALSE,NA,available,"Data will be made publicly available after peer-review, contact authors.",https://github.com/mansueto-institute/plosone_covid_counties,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/citation/,b5hj3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f2af7cfb084f602bec9c4f2/,5f2af7cfb084f602bec9c4f2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b5hj3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b5hj3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b5hj3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ten different WhatsApp groups were selected covering demographic and socio-economic profile and ten most important health-related fake news were studied. Different fake news circulation paths like forward, react, multi-forward, reference etc. were analyzed for different groups. It was observed that older generations (boomers) were more susceptible towards fake news and they tended to distribute the fake news in different groups. Male boomers actively circulate pseudo-science information whereas female boomers distribute faith-based information in the WhatsApp group.

f4p2a,preprints,2020-07-30,The COVID-19 Coping Study: A longitudinal mixed-methods study of mental health and well-being among older US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Objective
To describe the methodology and baseline cohort characteristics of the COVID-19
Coping Study, a longitudinal mixed-methods study of US adults aged ≥55.
Methods
Participants were recruited through online multi-frame non-probability sampling in April
and May, 2020. The baseline questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on
daily life and mental health. Monthly follow-ups will be conducted for one year.
Findings
In total, 6,938 adults participated across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and
Puerto Rico (mean [SD] age: 67.3 [7.9]; 64% female). Two in three adults reported
leaving home only for essential purposes in the past week (population-weighted
proportion: 69%; 95% CI: 68%-71%). One-quarter of older adults in work before the
pandemic reported reduced work hours or income (25%; 95% CI: 22%-27%). One in
three screened positive for depression (32%; 95% CI: 30%-34%) and anxiety (29%;
95% CI: 28%-31%).
Conclusions
We observed substantial self-reported effects of COVID-19 on daily life and prevalent
mental health symptoms in this cohort.

Especially during the lockdown period, social media were widely used for information and emotion sharing. This article aims to keep a material trace of these crisis communication trends. To reach this aim, we applied quantitative and qualitative methods on a corpus of 100,000 tweets we collected in the French-speaking part of Belgium. The corpus is divided into three sub-groups: citizens, politicians and the media. We first present the corpus collection and the methodology we followed. We also look at the lexical creativity that resulted from the crisis and the lockdown situation.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views.

sm9q6,preprints,2020-07-29,Perceptions of Inequality During the Coronavirus Outbreak,"It is known that Americans’ preferences for redistribution are generally not very elastic in relation to their perceptions of inequality. Even localized crises such as Hurricane Katrina that lay bare existing inequalities in society seem to do little to nothing in moving public opinion on this matter. However, the coronavirus pandemic presents a new opportunity for social scientists and policy experts to test whether large-scale national crises can lead to changes in people’s opinions. What is the impact of a crisis of this proportion on Americans’ attitudes towards inequality? More specifically, is there an “added value” to being informed about class inequalities in the context of the coronavirus outbreak compared to being informed about such inequalities in general terms without reference to this extraordinary event? This study answers these questions using an online experiment that manipulates the information respondents receive prior to answering survey questions. I find that receiving information about class inequalities specifically in relation to the outbreak tends to be much more effective in moving people’s opinions compared to receiving that information in a way that does not directly relate it to coronavirus.

The results indicate that confirmed cases are more positively correlated with NPIs than deaths, and NPIs show a strong positive correlation with deaths in the short run and a negative correlation in the long run.

uq2pf,preprints,2020-07-21,"Intelligent lockdown, intelligent effects? The impact of the Dutch COVID-19 ‘intelligent lockdown’ on gendered work and family dynamics among parents","This study examines the impact of the Dutch ‘intelligent lockdown’ during the COVID-19 pandemic on work and family dynamics among parents. This ‘intelligent lockdown’ relied on a combination of restrictive measures and an emphasis on individual responsibility as a means of lessening the spread and health impact of the pandemic. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is more than a public health crisis. Lockdown measures had substantial societal effects, including a significant impact on parents with (young) children. Given gender inequality existent prior to the pandemic, the question arises to what extent the consequences of the lockdown varied for mothers and fathers. Using representative survey data gathered among Dutch parents in April 2020, we explore changes in three areas: paid work, the division of care and household work, and quality of life (leisure, work-life balance, relationship dynamics). Our linear probability and multinomial logistic models demonstrate that the way in which families were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic reflects a complex gendered reality. We find that gender inequality patterns in the division of paid work, care work, and housework continue to exist. Moreover, the unique situation created by restrictive lockdown measures magnified some inequalities while others were lessened. We find evidence of increased gender inequality in relation to paid work and quality of life, yet a decrease in gender inequality in the division of care and household tasks. During the lockdown, Dutch fathers reported doing more care and household tasks than before. The insights provided here offer key comparative references for understanding the broader impact of lockdown measures on work and family dynamics, as well as quality of life as we move forward in the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,2020-07-21,2020-07-21,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 pandemic|division of care work|division of household work|gender inequality|gender roles|leisure|Netherlands|relationship dynamics|working from home|working time adaptation|work-life balance|work location,2020-07-21T13:39:05.826326,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-21,FALSE,NA,no,The data will be publicly available in the coming weeks from the LISS data archive: www.lissdata.nl,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Mara A.

Older adults are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection and associated adverse outcomes, whereas they often experience chronic diseases requiring institutional care. Hospital at home (HAH) is a strategic approach that may provide hospital-level care for older adults in their home settings. HAH may potentially minimize the health risks associated with COVID-19, ensure timely care for other health problems, improve health outcomes, reduce costs, increase satisfaction, and make institutional resources available for other patients during this pandemic.

qtgux,preprints,2020-07-10,"How the ‘plates’ of a health system can shift, change and adjust during economic recessions. A qualitative interview study of public and private health providers in Brazil’s São Paulo and Maranhão states","Background. Economic recessions carry an impact on population health and access to care; less is known on how health systems adapt to the conditions brought by a downturn. This particularly matters now that the COVID-19 epidemic is putting health systems under stress. Brazil is one of the world’s most affected countries, and its health system was already living the aftermath of the 2015 recession. 
Methods. Between 2018 and 2019 we conducted 46 semi-structured interviews with health practitioners, managers and policy-makers to explore the impact of the 2015 recession on public and private providers in prosperous (São Paulo) and impoverished (Maranhão) states in Brazil. Thematic analysis was employed to identify drivers and consequences of system adaptation and coping strategies. Nvivo software was used to aid data collection and analysis. We followed the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research to provide an account of the findings.
Results. We found the concept of ‘health sector crisis’ to be politically charged among healthcare providers in São Paulo and Maranhão. Contrary to expectations, the public sector was reported to have found ways to compensate for diminishing federal funding, having outsourced services and adopted flexible – if insecure – working arrangements. Following a drop in employment and health plans, private health insurance companies streamlined their offer, at times at the expenses of coverage. Low-cost walk-in clinics were hit hard by the recession, but also credited for having moved to cater for higher-income customers in Maranhão.
Conclusions. The ‘plates’ of a health system may shift and adjust in unexpected ways in response to recessions, and some of these changes might outlast the crisis. As low-income countries enter post-COVID recessions, it will be important to monitor the adjustments taking place in health systems, to ensure that past gains in access to care and job security are not eroded.",TRUE,2020-07-13,2020-07-12,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Brazil health system;|covid-19 and health systems;|economic recession and health;|health services in LMICs;,2020-07-12T19:49:44.038896,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-12,FALSE,NA,no,Interview transcripts can be obtained from the authors upon request,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Industrial Organization|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",Giuliano Russo,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/citation/,qtgux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f08775a58a9e700847e3e03/,5f08775a58a9e700847e3e03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qtgux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qtgux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qtgux,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
tdf8c,preprints,2020-07-08,Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work,"The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers.

83f9g,preprints,2021-04-25,The Impact of COVID-19 on Conspiracy Attitudes and Risk Perception in Italy: an Infodemiological Survey through Google Trends.,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused the worst international crisis since World War II. Italy was one of the countries most affected by both the pandemic and the related infodemic. The success of anti-COVID-19 strategies and future public health policies in Italy cannot prescind from containment of fake news and divulgation of correct information.
Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on conspiracy attitudes and risk perception of Italian web users.
Methods: Google Trends was used to monitor users' web interest in specific topics, such as conspiracy hypotheses, vaccine side effects, and pollution/climate change. The keywords adopted to represent these topics were mined from Bufale.net – an Italian website specialized in detecting online hoaxes – and Google Trends suggestions (i.e., related topics and related queries). Relative search volumes of the timelapse 2016-2020 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020-2021 (post-COVID-19) were compared through percentage difference (∆_%) and Welch’s t-test (t). When data series were not stationary, other ad-hoc criteria were used. The trend slopes were assessed through Sen's Slope (SS). The significance thresholds have been indicatively set at P=.05 and t=1.9.
Results: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically enforced Italian netizens' conspiracy attitudes (Δ_%∈[60,288],t∈[6,12]). The regional web interest towards conspiracy-related queries has increased and become more homogeneous compared to the pre-COVID-19 period ((RSV) ̅=80±2.8,t_min=1.8,Δ_(min%)=+12.4,min ∆_(SD%)=-25.8). Besides, a growing trend in web interest in the infodemic YouTube channel ""ByoBlu"" has been highlighted. The web interest in fake news has increased more than that in anti-hoax services (t_1=11.3  vs  t_2=4.5,Δ_1=+157.6  vs  Δ_2=+84.7). Equivalently, the web interest in vaccine side effects exceeded that in pollution/climate change (SS_vac=0.22,P&lt;.001  vs  SS_pol=0.05,P&lt;.001,∆_%=+296.4).
Conclusions: COVID-19 has given a significant boost to online conspiracy attitudes in Italy. In particular, the average web interest in conspiracy hypotheses has increased and become more uniform across regions. The pandemic accelerated an already growing trend in users' interest towards some fake news sources, including the 500,000 subscribers YouTube channel ""ByoBlu"" (canceled for disinformation in March 2021). The risk perception related to COVID-19 vaccines has been so distorted that vaccine side effects-related queries outweighed those relating to pollution and climate change, which are much more urgent issues. Based on these findings, it is necessary that the Italian authorities implement more effective infoveillance systems and communication by the mass media is less sensationalistic and more consistent with the available scientific evidence. In this context, Google Trends can be used to monitor the users' response to specific infodemiological countermeasures. Further research is needed to understand the psychological mechanisms that regulate risk perception

vndqr,preprints,2020-07-07,Optimistically biased economic growth forecasts and negatively skewed annual variation,"Authoritative economic growth forecasts are often optimistically biased. Negatively skewed variation--negative shocks being larger than positive shocks--could contribute to bias by making long-run average growth smaller than typical-year (median) growth. This positively biases forecasts based on typical years. We compare medians and means in real per-capita GDP growth across countries, regions, and time windows from 1820-2016. Over decadal periods, we find mean growth rates &lt;1%/y smaller than median growth rates in most countries and regions (median 0.23%/y across countries). Surprisingly, we find both large- and medium-magnitude shocks contribute to these differences, rather than only large ‘black swan’ events. We find negative skewness correlated with high levels and slow growth of per-capita GDP and population, and high per-capita GDP growth volatility, building on previous studies. We find negative skewness alone insufficient to explain recent growth over-projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",TRUE,2021-01-06,2020-07-09,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,business cycle|climate change|COVID-19|growth|recessions|sustainability,2020-07-09T05:04:51.272352,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-09,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth|https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-growth|https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/SPROLLs/world-economic-outlook-databases#sort=%40imfdate%20descending|https://www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget-economic-data#1|https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&amp;page=about,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/citation/,vndqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f04f5831484ac00b266cda9/,5f04f5831484ac00b266cda9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vndqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vndqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vndqr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
75d6m,preprints,2020-07-07,Linking excess mortality to mobility data during the COVID-19 pandemic in England and Wales,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented worldwide to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, the effectiveness of such governmental measures in reducing the mortality burden remains a key question of scientific interest and public debate. In this study, we leverage digital mobility data to assess the effects of reduced human mobility on excess mortality, focusing on regional data in England and Wales between February and August 2020. We estimate a robust association between mobility reductions and lower excess mortality, after adjusting for time trends and regional differences in a mixed-effects regression framework and considering a five-week lag between the two measures. We predict that, in the absence of mobility reductions, the number of excess deaths could have more than doubled in England and Wales during this period, especially in the London area.

4sfv9,preprints,2020-07-06,"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives. Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. 
To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics.
We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). 
In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.",TRUE,2020-07-07,2020-07-07,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,consequences of covid-19|coronavirus|covid-19|mental health|physical distancing|sars-cov-2|social relationships,2020-07-07T13:06:02.169813,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-07-07,FALSE,NA,no,https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/citation/,4sfv9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5f039fe43e1846004ac9157e/,5f039fe43e1846004ac9157e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4sfv9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4sfv9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4sfv9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aims to explain public opinion toward cell phone contact tracing using a survey experiment conducted with a representative sample of Canadian respondents. We build upon an established theory in evolutionary psychology—disease avoidance—to predict how media coverage of the pandemic affects public support for containment measures. We report three key findings. First, exposure to a news item that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps. And third, while a majority of respondents approve the reliance on cell phone contact tracing, many of them hold ambivalent thoughts about the technology.

Little is known about park use during the pandemic, how local features (e.g, park availability) influence use, and whether park visits accelerate COVID-19 spread. Using weekly panel data for 620 U.S. counties, we show park visits decreased by 10% beginning March 15, and by 17-35% through May 9, 2020. Net of weekly sample trends, park visits decreased by 2.3% when stay-at-home orders were in effect, yet increased by 8.3% after school closures and 4.1% after business closures. Park visits decreased less during the pandemic in metropolitan counties or where park availability was high.

p6mws,preprints,2020-07-02,EDUCATION DURING A PANDEMIC: A feasibility study of online classes in Bangladesh to counteract potential study gaps caused by COVID-19 related lockdowns,"The universities of Bangladesh used to suffer greatly from the so-called 'session jams' but most public and private universities overcome those difficulties and have mostly eliminated the session jams. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting lockdown, students are at risk of losing months or in certain cases missing sessions in the next step in their education. The situation is so dire that UNESCO has called it a worldwide unprecedented education emergency. 

Universities in Bangladesh and the university students in Bangladesh are also facing the same emergency. Online learning can be a potential solution to this problem. Such online learning requires facilities and infrastructure at the universities, a robust data infrastructure at the national level, and adequate computing devices and sufficient and affordable data services for the students.

However, very little concrete data exists to understand whether the universities and the students have the technical and financial means to make such online classes effective and successful.  

This study is one of  the first in Bangladesh that attempts to gauge the need and readiness of various stakeholders to implement successful fully online education. This paper suggests a process for measuring the readiness.

ug2c8,preprints,2020-06-29,Age Structure and Living Arrangements Shape the Vulnerability of Spanish Provinces to Outbreaks of Covid-19,"Background
Previous research has documented how age structures and co-residence patterns shape the vulnerability of populations to outbreaks of covid-19, with Spain being among the most vulnerable countries.
Objective
To document the role of age-specific co-residence patterns in shaping the vulnerability of Spanish provinces to mortality arising from within-household transmission of covid-19.
Method
We use data from the Spanish Population Registry 2018 on 10% of the population residing in private households in Spain. We combine information on the age and number of household members with infection fatality ratios related to covid-19 to estimate the average number of deaths per infection if a person becomes infected and transmits the virus to other household members. 
Results
Children live in the largest households of all age groups on average. However, the age profile of the persons that children live with reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of mortality arising due to within-household transmission of the virus.
Provinces with aged populations face a double challenge. Not only do they have large numbers of vulnerable persons due to their age, older persons are also more likely to share the same households in aged provinces.

We show how the vulnerability of Spanish provinces to covid-19 varies due to age structure and co-residence patterns and document the role of specific age-based co-residence arrangements in this result.",TRUE,2020-06-30,2020-06-30,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,coresidence|covid-19|family|households|mortality,2020-06-30T07:37:00.791783,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-30,FALSE,NA,no,The data of this artilce has been provided to the institution of the researchers by the national office for statistics through a bilateral agreement.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/citation/,ug2c8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5efa055f761b2c015f5ca6ff/,5efa055f761b2c015f5ca6ff,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ug2c8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ug2c8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ug2c8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
96fd2,preprints,2020-06-29,The Welfare State and Risk Perceptions: The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic and Public Concern in 70 Countries,"The novel coronavirus pandemic led individuals to experience heightened social risks, particularly financial and health related. The strength of a welfare state shapes individual risk perceptions under normal circumstances. My research question is whether it also shapes risk perceptions in abnormal disaster scenarios, for example amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. I test this using the data from the global COVIDiSTRESS survey to compare 70 countries in April of 2020, a month where deaths resulting from Covid-19 affected three-quarters of the world’s societies. Controlling for local timing and severity of the pandemic, welfare state strength predicts lower risk perceptions. However, this it is not a universal effect as I expected. The welfare state impact depends on how quickly a government introduced strong ‘lock down’ measures. The longer it took a government to respond the more the welfare state reduces risk perceptions. Governments that took lock down measures in advance of the virus show no variation in risk perceptions, whereas governments that took 30 days to respond have up to a 1.5 standard deviation range of risk perceptions depending on the strength of the welfare state.

Although MHLW provides a summary statistics about the COVID-19 cases and deaths on their webpage,  the distribution broken down by age and sex is not available, that leads many volunteering organizations to collect COVID-19 information based on prefectural/municipality reports.

We find that this narrative had significant consequences: in localities with higher Fox News viewership---exogenous due to random variation in channel positioning---people were less likely to adopt behaviors geared toward social distancing (e.g., staying at home) and consumed less goods in preparation (e.g., cleaning products, hand sanitizers, masks).

The seafood sector provides important sources of employment and nutrition, especially in low-income countries, and is highly globalized, allowing shocks to propagate internationally. We use a resilience ‘action cycle’ framework to study the first five months of COVID-19-related disruptions, impacts, and responses to the seafood sector. Looking across high- and low-income countries, we find that some supply chains, market segments, companies, small-scale actors and civil society have shown initial signs of greater resilience than others. For example, frozen Ecuadorian shrimp and Chinese tilapia exports were diverted to alternative markets, while live-fresh supply chains were more impacted. COVID-19 has also highlighted the vulnerability of certain groups working in- or dependent on the seafood sector.

962dy,preprints,2020-06-23,Older and ‘staying at home’ during lockdown: informal care receipt during the COVID-19 pandemic amongst people aged 70 and over in the UK,"On 23 March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented step to attempt to limit
the spread of coronavirus. Government advice at that time was that all older people aged 70
and over should stay at home and avoid any contact with non-household members. This study
uses new data from the Understanding Society COVID 19 survey collected in April 2020,
linked to Understanding Society Wave 9 data collected in 2018/19, in order to examine the
extent of support received by individuals aged 70 and over in the first four weeks of
lockdown from family, neighbours or friends not living in the same household, and how that
support had changed prior to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The research
distinguishes between different types of households as, given with guidance not to leave
home and not to let others into the household, those older people living alone or living only
with a partner also aged 70 and above are more likely to be particularly vulnerable. The
results highlight both positive news alongside causes for concern. The receipt of assistance
with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs), especially shopping, has increased
particularly among those living alone or with an older partner, reflecting the rise of
volunteering and community action during this period. However, not all older people reported
a rise, and the majority reported ‘no change’, in the support received. Moreover, amongst
those older people reporting that they required support with at least one Activity of Daily
Living (ADL) task prior to the pandemic, around one-quarter reported receiving no care from
outside the household and one-in-ten of those with two or more ADL care needs reported
receiving less help than previously. Although formal home care visits have continued during
the pandemic to those who have been assessed by the local government to be in need, it is
important to acknowledge that some older people risk not having the support they need.",TRUE,2020-06-24,2020-06-24,2020-06-22T23:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-109; pandemic; social care; unmet needs; older people,2020-06-24T18:36:02.910719,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-24,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-8644-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/citation/,962dy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ef26254659828024acf0e08/,5ef26254659828024acf0e08,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962dy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/962dy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/962dy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

5ypb2,preprints,2021-04-22,"Home, sweet home? The impact of working from home on the division of unpaid work during the COVID-19 lockdown","A lockdown implies a shift from the public to the private sphere, and from market to non-market production, thereby increasing the volume of unpaid work. Already before the pandemic, unpaid work was disproportionately borne by women. This paper studies the effect of working from home for pay (WFH), due to a lockdown, on the change in the division of housework and childcare within couple households. While previous studies on the effect of WFH on the reconciliation of work and family life and the division of labour within the household suffered from selection bias, we are able to identify this effect by drawing upon the shock of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The corresponding legal measures left little choice over WFH. In any case, WFH is exogenous, conditional on a small set of individual and household characteristics we control for. We employ data from a survey on the gendered aspects of the lockdown. The dataset includes detailed information on time use during the lockdown and on the quality and experience of WFH. Uniquely, this survey data also includes information on the division, and not only magnitude, of unpaid work within households. Austria is an interesting case in this respect as it is characterized by very conservative gender norms. The results reveal that the probability of men taking on a larger share of housework increases if men are WFH alone or together with their female partner. By contrast, the involvement of men in childcare increased only in the event that the female partner was not able to WFH. Overall, the burden of childcare, and particularly homeschooling, was disproportionately borne by women.",TRUE,2021-04-22,2021-04-22,2021-04-21T22:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Division of Labour|Feminist Economics|Gender|Homeschooling|Time use|Unpaid Work|Work from Home,2021-04-22T10:36:21.057190,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-22,FALSE,NA,no,The dataset and code files are available upon request,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,Judith Derndorfer|Franziska Disslbacher|Vanessa Lechinger|Katharina Mader|Eva Six,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/citation/,5ypb2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/608149222952d8006e8d8511/,608149222952d8006e8d8511,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ypb2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ypb2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ypb2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
w6c9b,preprints,2020-06-21,Applications of artificial intelligence technologies on mental health research during COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted mental health globally. It is essential to deploy advanced research methodologies that may use complex data to draw meaningful inferences facilitating mental health research and policymaking during this pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a wide range of opportunities to leverage advancements in data sciences in analyzing health records, behavioral data, social media contents, and outcomes data on mental health.

67ptf,preprints,2020-06-20,When Motivation Becomes Desperation: Online Freelancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study combines market-level data about changes in jobs offered via online labor platforms and interviews with online freelance workers to highlight how freelancers are responding to the novel coronavirus’s presence. We pursue this work recognizing that as the scope and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grow, the implications to workers and labor markets are profound. Our focus on online labor markets and workers reflects our enduring interest in knowledge work, with a particular attention to precarious work. Market data show the dramatic shifts in work availability (supply) and the changes in worker availability (demand) as the United States’ economy struggles with the initial burst of effects of a pandemic. Interview data reveal that freelance workers are aware of these shifts. These changes to already- precarious and market-driven work arrangements are magnified by the realities of balancing family members’ changes in job status, working around children who are home from school, and re-organizing work and lives to account for the rapid onset and confusion of stay-at-home requirements and the uncertainty that is the core of the pandemic. Findings suggest work flexibility, which seems central to freelancer’s motivation to pursue such work, is diminishing and instead freelancers are being driven by desperation rooted in the acknowledged precarity of their situation, magnified by the constellation of events reshaping their working arrangements. We further observe that these effects vary by occupation and are more keenly experienced by women freelancers, both of which warrant additional attention.",TRUE,2020-06-23,2020-06-23,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Freelance work|Motivation|Occupations|Online labor markets|Online Labour Index,2020-06-23T04:03:54.213366,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-23,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/citation/,67ptf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eedf3096598280127cf3d41/,5eedf3096598280127cf3d41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/67ptf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/67ptf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/67ptf,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

mrv69,preprints,2020-06-18,Studying the prominence effect amid the COVID-19 crisis: implications for public health policy decision-making.,"Background: The novel COVID-19 has brought upon crucial policy- and decision-
making situations, especially when making judgments between economic and health
concerns. One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence
effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of
the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together.
This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In
this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two
decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates
heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.’s classic
experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming
condition. Methods and Findings: Four hundred twenty participants from the UK were
recruited via a crowd-working platform. They were presented with two casualty-
minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100
lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at
the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose
between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of
program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally
attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a)
economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that
in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are
more prominent (only under economic priming was there a significant preference for
program Y, p&lt;0.001). In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of
health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all “preferred” the cheaper
option. Conclusions: These results add further support to the practical relevance of
using the proper decision-making modes in times of consequential crises where
multiple concerns, interests, and parties are involve",TRUE,2020-06-21,2020-06-21,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-06-21T03:27:20.761854,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-21,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/vh2r6/?view_only=42c180392c5c4e0c959141d214d844a0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/citation/,mrv69,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vh2r6/,vh2r6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eeb07a576ebd80022cd93ad/,5eeb07a576ebd80022cd93ad,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrv69/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrv69/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrv69,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Approaches based on complexity science taking into account that interdependence and its associated systemic risks must be mainstreamed in current policy making, in general. However, at present, that could result in failure for three main reasons: (1) those approaches might be too sophisticated for current policy making pursuing sustainable development; (2) the reductionist views from conventional economics still deeply influence economic and environmental policy making; (3) it is unlikely that far-reaching policies aimed at stimulating post-pandemic economic development can be steered through radically innovative approaches that remain untested.

p25nh,preprints,2020-06-12,The Political Scar of Epidemics,"What will be political legacy of the Coronavirus pandemic? We find that epidemic exposure in an individual's impressionable years (ages 18 to 25) has a persistent negative effect on confidence in political institutions and leaders. We find similar negative effects on confidence in public health systems, suggesting that the loss of confidence in political leadership and institutions is associated with healthcare related policies at the time of the epidemic. In line with this argument, our results are mostly driven by individuals who experienced epidemics under weak governments with less capacity to act against the epidemic, disappointing their citizens. We provide evidence of this mechanism by showing that weak governments took longer to introduce policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These results imply that the Coronavirus may leave behind a long-lasting political scar on the current young generation (""Generation Z"").",TRUE,2020-06-16,2020-06-16,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|democracy|epidemics|government approval|political trust,2020-06-16T07:40:01.523477,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-16,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/citation/,p25nh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee35dab44eab5004051eee7/,5ee35dab44eab5004051eee7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p25nh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p25nh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p25nh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
sd3h6,preprints,2020-06-12,The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos.

mdjsn,preprints,2020-06-11,Year 10 and 12 school students' opinions on returning to partial schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: an action research prospective survey,"Objective
Educational provision changed during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK (20th March to 31st May 2020) with schooling moving online. The Prime Minister announced a timetable for partial reopening of school on 10th May. With the return to partial schooling imminent, the views of year 10 and year 12 students were surveyed.
Design 
Cross-sectional web-based survey disseminated via closed social media fora.
Setting 
A structured questionnaire hosted on Google Forms™ and disseminated via two Facebook™ fora in the week prior to the original stated date of return to partial schooling for year 10 and year 12 students (20th  to 27th May 2020).
Participants 
United Kingdom school students in year 10 (age 14 to 15 years old) and year 12 (age 16 to 17 years old).
Main outcome measures 
Views of year 10 and year 12 students on returning to schools with a focus on their opinions on government guidance, impact on their future, and how remote learning has impacted on their education.
Results 	
1534 students (yr10 n= 1007 66%, yr12 n=527 34%) completed the questionnaire.
Students were equally divided in opinion with 781 (51%) preferring to return to partial schooling with limited educational contact and 753 (49%) preferring to remain isolated at home with remote schooling, when an unsure option was removed.
A majority (73%, n=1111) of students feel unsafe or unsure that Government guidelines will be enough to protect them from COVID-19 in a school environment. 79% (n=1205) of students felt that COVID-19 has impacted on their future. 15% (n=231) of students said they have had no additional support or guidance from their school during remote learning.
Conclusions
Year 10 and 12 school students were divided equally in their preferences about returning to partial school. Exploration of their uncertainty by thematic analysis revealed the source to be anxieties around safety. Students feel they are being put at risk and because guidelines will be impossible to enforce in a school environment. Some students recognised a need to return to education despite this perceived risk. An inequity in the standard of education was identified with 15% (n=231) of students reporting that they did not receive any support during the 87 days of lock down.  School students expressed desire that their concerns be heard by the Government. Better consideration needs to be taken of the concerns of these year groups in the future.",TRUE,2020-06-12,2020-06-12,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|education|impact of COVID-19 on future|lockdown|lockdown impact on education|online learning|partial schooling|preferences to returning to school after pandemic|remote schooling|return to school|school|student attitude towards returning to school|student perception on government guidelines|student voice|year 10|year 12,2020-06-12T11:39:03.843915,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-12,FALSE,NA,no,Data available subject to a data sharing agreement,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/citation/,mdjsn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee2995ea777b70018ab5c8d/,5ee2995ea777b70018ab5c8d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mdjsn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mdjsn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mdjsn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prolonged Covid-19-related school closures in the UK raised concerns that science teaching and learning at primary level would be negatively impacted. This paper reports the findings of phase 1 of a study that the authors are conducting with teachers and parents to explore this issue. We found that a significant proportion of teachers were providing less science during lockdown than in the normal school week. Teachers, particularly those working in more deprived areas, reported that translating the science curriculum for home learning had been difficult, with concerns around resources, internet access and parental ability to help. Some areas of the curriculum posed particular difficulties, leading to a narrowing of topics being taught. Both teachers and parents felt that schools prioritised English and maths above science. Meanwhile some parents reported that their children had engaged in sophisticated extracurricular activities, bolstered by resources available at home and knowledgeable adult help, but others said that their children had done no science at all.  Parents who had studied science at post-compulsory level were much more comfortable in helping their children with science home learning. These factors combine to create conditions which may exacerbate existing inequalities as to who can access science education and careers.",TRUE,2021-05-06,2020-06-11,2021-05-05T23:00:00,10.1007/s43545-021-00122-9,TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|education|primary education|science education|widening participation,2020-06-11T00:57:20.788617,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-11,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/citation/,98rd5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/j7e5v/,j7e5v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ee101f59e163700648fb2a0/,5ee101f59e163700648fb2a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98rd5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/98rd5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/98rd5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43545-021-00122-9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,"We use party-identifying language – like “Liberal Media” and “MAGA”– to identify Republican users on the investor social platform StockTwits. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the beliefs of partisan Republicans about equities remain relatively unfazed during the COVID-19 pandemic, while other users become considerably more pessimistic. In cross-sectional tests, we find Republicans become relatively more optimistic about stocks that suffered the most from COVID-19, but more pessimistic about Chinese stocks.

exym8,preprints,2020-06-07,Intergenerational contacts and Covid-19 spread: Omnipresent grannies or bowling together?,"Many scientists are currently contributing research on SARS-CoV2, with social scientists focusing on demographic and behavioral aspects when it comes to the diffusion of the virus. Recent publications include valid contributions about the importance of population’s demographic composition to understand country-differences in fatalities, and some speculations about the origins of different pace and patterns of diffusion. Among them the idea that intergenerational contacts would contribute to explain the fast spread and high fatality among the elderly population in some countries. We argument that in order to contribute to the scientific knowledge speculation is not enough and acknowledge that in the absence of solid, comparable data it is difficult to bring these ideas to an empirical test. Further, we present a simulation experiment shedding serious doubts on the importance of intergenerational contacts to spread the virus on the elderly population but underlining, instead, the importance of the high connectedness within the elderly population. That southern Europeans are not bowling alone seems to be more relevant to explain high diffusion among elderly than their contact to their (grand-)children.",TRUE,2020-06-18,2020-06-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Elderly|Intergenerational Relations|Intergenerational Ties,2020-06-18T01:40:21.486635,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-18,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/citation/,exym8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fjyh3/,fjyh3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5edd19acc67d3000fa1f38e4/,5edd19acc67d3000fa1f38e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/exym8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/exym8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exym8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For archives, many institutions are on an unforgiving precipice of irrelevancy. The focus of this paper is not to iterate the necessity of archival theory but to examine the position of appraisal within a technologically-driven, internet society. Of significance to this evaluation is that organization, retrieval, and use of information have evolved, and users are central players in curation cycles. Also, of importance are those archives shifting to, and innovating, decentralized digital models - and thriving. A historical overview of both fields shows that appraisal falters in technical maturation and in response to changes in how society generates, captures, and retrieves information. There exist alternate paradigms for archival roles and appraisal, however, including recognizing that users derive the interpretation of information and that transdisciplinary archivists are vital.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was through social networks that many state leaders have informed the public about their actions. I examine how many leaders used Twitter, in what way, and the impact they had on the public. In the context of Twitter, the impact on the public refers to the growth in followers as it signifies the increased interest of the public about information. In this article, I collected 50,872 tweets from 143 state leaders and created an original dataset containing information on the growth of followers. I used ordinary least square regression models. This led to the finding that 64.8% of UN member states had a leader that tweeted about COVID-19. Furthermore, a significant increase in the number of followers during the pandemic compared to months prior was noted. Since March, the pandemic has been a dominant topic on Twitter. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the highest percentage increase in gaining Twitter followers was experienced by politicians who frequently tweeted and those who had a lower ratio of the number of followers to internet users.

2p3xt,preprints,2020-06-04,"“Saving lives, protecting livelihoods, and safeguarding nature”: risk-based wildlife trade policy for sustainable development outcomes post-COVID-19","The COVID‐19 pandemic has caused huge loss of life, and immense social and economic harm. Wildlife trade has become central to discourse on COVID-19, zoonotic pandemics, and related policy responses, which must focus on “saving lives, protecting livelihoods, and safeguarding nature”. Proposed policy responses have included extreme measures such as banning all use and trade of wildlife, or blanket measures for entire Classes. However, different trades pose varying degrees of risk for zoonotic pandemics, while some trades also play critical roles in delivering other aspects of sustainable development, particularly related to poverty, hunger, decent work, responsible consumption and production, and life on land and below water. Here we describe how wildlife trade contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in diverse ways, with synergies and trade-offs within and between the SDGs. In doing so, we show that prohibitions could result in severe trade-offs against some SDGs, with limited benefits for public health via pandemic prevention. This complexity necessitates context-specific policies, with multi-sector decision-making that goes beyond simple top-down solutions. We encourage decision-makers to adopt a risk-based approach to wildlife trade policy post-COVID-19, with policies formulate via participatory, evidence-based approaches, which explicitly acknowledge uncertainty, complexity and conflicting values across different components of the SDGs. This could help to ensure that future use and trade of wildlife is safe, environmentally-sustainable and socially-just.",TRUE,2021-02-24,2020-06-04,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,conservation|COVID19|ecosystems|environmental policy|human well-being|livelihoods|multi-sector|pandemics|public health|SDGs|sustainable development goals|trade-offs|zoonotic diseases,2020-06-04T17:18:01.564958,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-04,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/citation/,2p3xt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/58ms9/,58ms9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed8f580fabc45004f639790/,5ed8f580fabc45004f639790,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2p3xt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2p3xt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2p3xt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
kxajh,preprints,2020-06-03,Dynamics of Behavior Change in the COVID World,"All of the policies adopted or proposed so far to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus require immediate and extensive behavioral change. However, even when the benefit of the behavior change is supported by solid science, actually changing behavior is difficult. Doing so effectively requires an appreciation for how people learn behaviors, and translate information into action. Insights from the evolutionary human sciences can improve the behavioral change toolkit for researchers and policy makers. Specifically, effective  behavior change policy should be based on an understanding of humans as a cultural and cooperative species. Socially transmitted information and culturally-informed motivations shape behavior change. The structure of social networks and how group identities map onto those networks in turn influence transmission dynamics.

gfnep,preprints,2020-06-03,China Experience in Controlling COVID-19,"At present, the epidemic situation of COVID-19 is raging rampantly in the whole world, affecting the hearts of billions of people. In less than half a year, COVID-19 swept the world, seriously threatening the safety of all mankind. At the beginning, the epidemic was most serious in China.  Under the strong command of the highest level of the Chinese government, the whole Chinese people United as one, and achieved initial results in the struggle against covid-19 with scientific prevention and control. Summarizing China's experience and lessons in combating the epidemic is undoubtedly very beneficial to the people of the world in jointly combating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. The most important experience is: strong organizational leadership, enhanced cooperation with the WHO, the establishment of a national anti-epidemic headquarters, responsible for the command and control of human, financial and material resources throughout the country, and local officials at all levels in the front line of the epidemic. Heart to heart with the people, breathe together and share a common destiny. Prevention is the first, prevention and treatment are combined. The treatment emphasizes the combination of Chinese and Western medicine. The “Four Anti and Two Balances” advocated by Academician Li Lanjuan’s team, and the “Three Drugs and Three Formulas” recommended by Chinese medicine experts of the National and Health Commission, played a key role in improving the success rate of treatment. Establish fever clinics and establish square cabin hospital to eliminate infections in hospitals, emphasizing the protection of medical staff and avoiding cross-infection. Control the source of infection, try to achieve ""four early"", early detection, early isolation, early diagnosis and early treatment. ""Four concentration"", focus on patients, experts, resources and treatment. Take all measures to cut off the spread. Take all measures to protect susceptible people. Wearing masks, washing hands frequently, hot bathing, individual serving, home office, going out to maintain a social distance of more than one meter, eating nutritious foods rich in protein and vitamins, strengthening physical exercise and improving physical fitness are all effective ways to prevent COVID-19.",TRUE,2020-06-10,2020-06-03,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,China|COVID-19|COVID-19 prevention|COVID-19 treatment|Experience and lessons learned|mask|Mobile square cabin hospital|prevention|prevention of medical staff infection|Traditional Chinese medicine|treatment,2020-06-03T16:26:40.960056,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-03,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d60|Education|Health and Physical Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/citation/,gfnep,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y9j72/,y9j72,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed7abc5237cd3008354b579/,5ed7abc5237cd3008354b579,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gfnep/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gfnep/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gfnep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has created an unanticipated global public health crisis. The virus is spreading rapidly in India which poses serious threat to 135 crore population. Population density poses some unforeseen challenges to control the COVID-19 contagion. In times of crisis, data is crucial to understand the spatial relationship between density and the infection. The article study the district wise transmissions of the novel coronavirus in five south Indian states until 6th June 2020 and its relationship with the respective population density. The five states are purposefully selected for better healthcare infrastructure vis-à-vis other states in India. We observed that corona virus spread depends on the spatial distribution of population density in three states especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana. The results indicate that the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to differ with demographic density.

It is based on a virtual town hall hosted by the Community Innovation and Action Center (CIAC) at the University of Missouri, St. Louis on April 18, 2020. Based on these initial public discussions, we use St. Louis as a lens for arguing that that government’s attenuated impact is not due to a natural disaster itself, but the inevitable result of race-based policies that had worked against African Americans over generations.

In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and its academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, have been working to conduct a study that can offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the United States. Through three phases of survey-based data collection, ranging from April 9th to May 21st, 2020, a longitudinal perspective of how outdoor recreationists are reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed from this research. The timing of this research was purposeful, as it intended to capture self-reported information related to outdoor recreation and COVID-19 during periods of time when the virus had been officially documented as a pandemic, resulting federal and state stay-at-home orders were implemented across the U.S., and many parks and protected closed or discontinued regular operations. Phases 1 and 2 of this assessment were detailed by previous reports. This report details the findings across all three phases of research. These findings track behaviors, psychosocial determinants of outdoor recreation decision-making, and future intentions across the study period. This report is intended to provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world.

Earlier studies on the topic are based on cross-sectional data with different survey designs and sample selections. 

-	Women undertake the major share of housework and childcare and form 80% of the health and social care workers who are more exposed to the virus, among people aged between 20 to 49. 

-	There was a 30% reduction in paid work time for both women and men, and the percentage was 45% among non-key workers. Women and men experienced a similar amount (3-4 hours) of an increase in weekly housework hours. We also note a comparable reduction in monthly labour income for women and men. 

-	Women, especially mothers experienced a more dramatic decline in well-being amid the COVID pandemic.

-	Single mothers fare the worst in the labour market, are the least likely to own a house, have a car in the household, and have the highest risk of depression, which makes them particularly vulnerable in the current circumstances. Single parents experience the largest 7% increase in the non-working rates during the lockdown period.

User-generated content by non-professionals, or netizens, has shed light on issues they deem important by capturing and sharing footage appealing to their inner digital network and mainstream media. However, the influence that digital testimonials exerts on activism and indexing has been restricted to those possessing some media training. This paper aims to fill this gap by providing a framework to guide vulnerable people experiencing harsh conditions to leverage the power of social media. The expectation is that such a guideline would help the most vulnerable draw the attention of other members of the community, authorities and mainstream media to the conditions they are in. The proposal of this framework is based on the theory of mediatized conflict and analysis of the hashtag #FallecidosCovid19Ec on Twitter.

This article takes the UN-Habitat report as the premise to carry out an empirical investigation in the four major metro cities of India. The report's concern with the urban character of the pandemic has underlined the role of cities in disease transmission. In that wake, the study demarcates factors at the sub-city level that tend to jeopardize the two mandatory precautionary measures during COVID-19 – Social Distancing and Lockdown. It investigates those factors through a Covid Vulnerability Index. The Index devised with the help of Analytic Hierarchy Process demarcates the low, moderate, high, and very high vulnerable city sub-units. Secondly, UN- Habitat's one of the major action areas is evidence-based knowledge creation through mapping and its analysis. In our study, we do it at a granular scale for arriving at a more nuanced understanding. Thus, in harmony with the UN-habitat's we take the urban seriously and identify the gaps that need to be plugged for the pandemic cities of now and of the future.",TRUE,2020-08-11,2020-06-02,NA,10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102230,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Covid Vulnerability Index|Lockdown|Metro Cities|Social Distancing|UN-Habitat,2020-06-02T05:13:11.780785,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-02,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/citation/,523r8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed5c400aeeb6d044e08464b/,5ed5c400aeeb6d044e08464b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/523r8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/523r8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/523r8,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102230,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
qhkf9,preprints,2020-06-02,Negative shocks predict change in cognitive function and preferences: Assessing the negative affect and stress hypothesis,"In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, households throughout the world have to cope with negative shocks, either because of the disease or the various mitigation strategies that have caused massive unemployment and financial insecurity. Previous research has shown that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=1,652), Spain (N=1,660) and the United Kingdom (N=1,578). We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences.
Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity). Data do not support the hypotheses that the result is driven by stress or by negative emotions.",TRUE,2021-02-02,2020-06-02,2020-06-01T05:00:00,10.1038/s41598-021-83089-0,TRUE,FALSE,altruism|cognitive reflection test|COVID-19|negative economic shock|reciprocity|risk preferences|time preferences|trust,2020-06-02T05:24:22.615801,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-02,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/xrzv4,available,NA,https://osf.io/xrzv4,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/citation/,qhkf9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tbys6/,tbys6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed59e4daeeb6d043b08c3f7/,5ed59e4daeeb6d043b08c3f7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qhkf9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qhkf9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qhkf9,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83089-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

9vp7x,preprints,2020-06-01,Financial Incentives for Downloading COVID–19 Digital Contact Tracing Apps,"Contact tracing is a key approach for controlling the COVID–19 pandemic. Traditional tracing methods might however miss a number of contacts between infected and susceptible persons. Digital contact tracing apps have been developed to assist health departments in notifying individuals of recent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. These apps are used in several countries throughout the world, and some US states have either launched or are planning to launch such apps. The potential effects of digital contact tracing apps depend however on their widespread adoption. Most investigations of the determinants of adoption among potential users have focused on issues related to privacy features (e.g., who can access data, whether location is recorded) and the accuracy of the app in notifying users of exposures to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., false notifications). In this paper, we investigate whether financial incentives might help further accelerate the adoption of digital contact tracing apps. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with an online sample of 394 US residents aged 18–69 years old. We asked participants to make a series of choices between two hypothetical versions of a digital contact tracing app characterized by several randomly selected attributes, including varying levels of financial cost or incentives to download. In this experiment, financial incentives were more than twice as important in the decision-making process about DCT app downloads than privacy and accuracy. In order to accelerate adoption, US States planning to launch digital contact tracing apps should consider offering financial incentives for download to potential users.",TRUE,2020-06-18,2020-06-01,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Contact tracing|Coronavirus|COVID-19|Digital apps|Discrete choice experiment|Financial incentives|Innovation in healthcare|Stated preferences,2020-06-01T18:51:43.368508,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-06-01,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dea|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Policy Design, Analysis, and Evaluation",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/citation/,9vp7x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed486adc7568603ce2d2e17/,5ed486adc7568603ce2d2e17,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9vp7x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9vp7x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9vp7x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

qyjtm,preprints,2020-05-30,Popular Reactions to Coordination Problems under External Threats,"Exogenous threats pose a formidable coordination challenge to federations, as they compel governments at all levels to cooperate to prevent a collective risk. As the vertical fragmentation of powers complicates a coordinated response, we here argue that the central government becomes the focal point of the solution. In search of a more effective response against the threat, citizens coordinate their preferences around the centralization of authority boundaries in the federation. We test this argument using an on-line survey experiment in Spain, a country where the threat caused by COVID-19 has operated on top of non-negligible internal threats. The empirical analysis shows that exposure to vertical coordination failures prompt citizens to support a centralized redrawing of authority boundaries, though this effect is importantly conditioned by respondents’ ideology and territorial preferences. Our findings suggest that shocks may represent turning points for the stability of federations, as citizens demands for a redrawing of authority might be followed by beneficial or opportunistic adjustments of authority.",TRUE,2021-02-19,2020-05-30,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,covid-19,2020-06-01T16:26:55.893508,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/citation/,qyjtm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wvr5k/,wvr5k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed2475ec7568603842d5932/,5ed2475ec7568603842d5932,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qyjtm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qyjtm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qyjtm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

All three networks are “small worlds” characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths, and multiple independent paths connecting students. Students from different majors cluster together, but gateway courses and distributional requirements create cross-major integration. Connectivity declines when large courses of 100 students or more are removed from the network, as might be the case if some courses are taught online, but moderately sized courses must also be removed before less than half of student-pairs are connected in three steps and less than two-thirds in four steps.

8fzay,preprints,2020-05-29,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Sexual Behavior among Gay and Bisexual Men in the United States,"After decades of navigating HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, gay and bisexual men are again responding to new and uncertain risks presented by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by adapting aspects of their sexual behavior. We fielded a survey of LGBTQ Americans’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic collected from April 10 to May 10, 2020, an important time period during which most states issued stay-at-home orders (April 10 to April 30) and also began implementing phased reopening (May 1 to May 10). In this paper, we limit analyses to a subsample of 728 gay and bisexual men and focus on changes to sexual behavior in response to the pandemic. We find that many gay and bisexual men made significant changes to their sexual behavior and partner selection. Nine out of 10 men in our sample reported having either one sexual partner or no sexual partner in the last 30 days, which, for many, was a substantial decrease compared to just before the pandemic. Men also made changes to the kinds of partners they had and their sexual activities with partners (e.g., more virtual sex), engaged in new strategies to reduce their risks of infection from partners, and expressed high levels of concern about how HIV may affect COVID-19 risk, treatment, and recovery. We expect these changes to be important not only for reducing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but also for reducing new sexually transmitted infections. Despite substantial changes in sexual behavior for most men in our sample, we note concerns around the sustainability of sexual behavior change over time and nondisclosure of COVID-19 symptoms to partners.",TRUE,2020-06-17,2020-05-30,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|gay men|HIV|MSM|sex|sexual behavior|US,2020-06-01T16:26:30.534805,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/citation/,8fzay,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pvgya/,pvgya,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed18880aeeb6d039108c16e/,5ed18880aeeb6d039108c16e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8fzay/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8fzay/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8fzay,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

f73u4,preprints,2020-05-29,Models and methods to analyse the interaction of evidence and policy in the first 100 days of the UK government's response to COVID-19 (v1.1),"BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK.  With currently no vaccine and no treatment, there is no medical solution. Consequently, the questions for evidence and policy are complex, draw on multiple streams, and are about management rather than medicine.  This working paper sets out models and methods for a forthcoming study to analyse the interaction of evidence and policy in the first 100 days of the UK government’s response to COVID-19.
MODELS
Drawing on chaos theory and insights from the policy sciences, three models of evidence-based policy are discussed: a linear cipher model, a multiple streams model, and a melee model.  The nonlinear melee model is adopted for the forthcoming study, in which multiple forms of evidence (science, economic, political, social) and actors interact in real time, and supposedly independent evidence streams concomitantly consider evidence from other streams, creating an apparently chaotic melee in which it is unclear where, how and by whom decisions originate or are made.  This is normal, and much closer to how policy decisions emerge than the process represented by rational, ideal-type, linear models.
METHODS
DESIGN: An analysis of evidence in and of the policy response to COVID-19 by the UK government for the 100 days from 1st February 2020 to 11th May 2020 will be undertaken.
DATA: Three data sources will be accessed: papers from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and its feeder groups and committees; formal government statements, information and guidance; BBC News coverage of government press briefings and further documents and/or coverage snowballing from them.
ANALYSIS: A thematic content analysis, pre-structured by the four evidence streams in the melee model, will be undertaken to identify critical incidents for a strict contemporaneous analysis using only information available at the time of the incident, and referring only to the contemporaneous context for the incident.  
ASSUMPTIONS: Illustrative critical incidents will be sufficient to provide evidence for the explanatory utility of the melee model. Comprehensive coverage of all incidents would unnecessarily super-saturate the analysis.",TRUE,2020-06-17,2020-05-30,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Evidence; policy; melee model; COVID-19; chaos theory; policy sciences,2020-06-01T16:26:45.205417,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/citation/,f73u4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed147b817ac9e03826243d4/,5ed147b817ac9e03826243d4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f73u4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f73u4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f73u4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
5ym9n,preprints,2020-05-29,Revenge of the Experts: Will COVID-19 Renew or Diminish Public Trust in Science?,"An effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is sometimes suggested, will be to reverse the secular trend toward questioning the value of scientific research and expertise. We analyze this hypothesis by examining how exposure to previous epidemics affected the confidence of individuals in science and scientists. Consistent with theory and evidence that attitudes are durably formed when individuals are in their impressionable years between the ages of 18 and 25, we focus on people who were exposed to epidemics in their country of residence at this stage of the life course. Combining data from a 2018 Wellcome Trust survey of more than 70,000 individuals in 160 countries with data on global epidemics since 1970, we show that such exposure has no impact on views of science as an endeavor or on opinions of whether the study of disease is properly an aspect of science, but that it significantly reduces confidence in scientists and the benefits of their work. These findings are robust to a variety of controls, empirical methods and sensitivity checks. We suggest some implications for how scientific findings are communicated and for how scientists seeking to inform and influence public opinion should position themselves in the public sphere.",TRUE,2020-06-17,2020-05-30,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|formative years|science|scientist|trust,2020-06-01T16:26:30.648967,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/citation/,5ym9n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed0cfb517ac9e033362143b/,5ed0cfb517ac9e033362143b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5ym9n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5ym9n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5ym9n,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
x9m36,preprints,2020-05-28,"Assessing concerns for the economic consequence of the COVID-19 response and mental health problems associated with economic vulnerability and negative economic shock in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom","Currently, many different countries are under lockdown or extreme social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=3,504), Spain (N=3,524) and the United Kingdom (N=3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizens’ concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to estimate the consequences of the economic lockdown in terms of mental health, by predicting the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for “the way out” of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lockdown and extreme social distancing in the three countries has had an enormous impact on individuals’ mental health and this should be taken into account for future decisions made on regulations concerning the pandemic.",TRUE,2021-01-03,2020-05-30,2020-10-27T05:00:00,10.1371/journal.pone.0240876,TRUE,FALSE,anxiety|COVID-19|depression|random forest|social desirability bias|stress|vulnerability,2020-06-01T16:26:31.019589,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-30,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/citation/,x9m36,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tbys6/,tbys6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ed01cfdc7568602ea2d1ea3/,5ed01cfdc7568602ea2d1ea3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x9m36/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x9m36/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x9m36,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240876,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

xphe9,preprints,2020-05-28,The French public’s attitudes to a future COVID-19 vaccine: the politicization of a public health issue,"As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 flu illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N=5,018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis but oppose people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party.

je7vt,preprints,2020-05-26,The association of UV with rates of COVID-19 transmission and deaths in Mexico: the possible mediating role of vitamin D.,"The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927.  However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city.  We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths.   The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors).  Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample.  We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect.  UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself.  We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance.   We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body.  This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present.  In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.",TRUE,2020-05-26,2020-05-26,2020-05-21T05:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,elevation|immunity|pandemia|Transmission rates;|Ultraviolet radiation,2020-05-26T21:52:24.082499,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-26,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/citation/,je7vt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4w2tb/,4w2tb,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ecd61bac7568601f42d2c0e/,5ecd61bac7568601f42d2c0e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/je7vt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/je7vt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/je7vt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the study, a simulated client called and described a list of symptoms experienced by her brother, and asked the pharmacist for a recommendation. In our ""common"" condition, the symptoms were headache, sore throat, and fever. In our COVID condition, we added anosmia (i.e., the loss of smell) as a fourth symptom, allowing better discrimination with respect to other diseases. We find that mentioning anosmia induced a more cautious behavior among pharmacists. The probability that pharmacists recommend to register the case in the dedicated emergency line increased from 19.7 to 32.2 percent, whereas the probability that pharmacists make a prescription decreased from 69.7 to 51.5 percent.

725dv,preprints,2020-05-22,Could Ramadan catalyze SARS-CoV-2 spread? Preliminary results,"Around 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide celebrate in some extent the holy month of Ramadan during COVID-19 pandemic. Some increase their attendance worship sites and traditional dining in extended families, so infectious contact rates could increase. Moreover, fasting could increase the probability of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are mitigation measures (e.g. Healthy Ramadan by WHO) applied to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 spread, however their real impact is still unknown. Multiple studies assessed observed effects of contact rates increase during holidays as Chinese New Year in January and Passover and Easter in April and their short-time effects on COVID-19 transmission dynamics. However, there are any quantitative attempts considering epidemiological consequences of the holy Ramadan (at least up to our knowledge and keywords search in various databases until the submission day). We analyze the fractions of Muslims and time series of COVID-19 daily incidence and cases numbers for 197 countries and territories. We found statistically significant positive link with proportion of Islam adherents with increase in normalized new cases of COVID-19 during 1-18 May 2020.

In the latter, four variables explain 72% of the variance in log COVID-19 mortality rate: log cumulative confirmed cases rate, log % black or Asian, average household size, and the deprivation index.

wr9jb,preprints,2020-05-21,"The impact of COVID-19 on fertility plans in Italy, Germany, France, Spain and UK","This study offers an overview on changes in fertility plan during the COVID-19 crisis of a representative sample of the young population (18-34) in Italy, France, Germany, Spain and UK. Data were collected between March 27 and April 7, 2020.  Our results show that fertility plans have been negatively revised in all countries, but not in the same way. In Germany and France fertility plans changed moderately, with many people still planning or postponing their decision to have a child during the 2020. In Italy, instead, the proportion of abandoners is much higher than in other countries, while comparatively it shows a lower proportion of those deciding to postpone their plans. Moreover, the demographic characteristics of the individuals seem to be associated with fertility plans in different ways across countries. In Italy, abandoners are common among individuals younger than 30 and those without a tertiary education. In Germany, abandoners are slightly more prevalent in the regions most affected by the COVID-19. In UK, fertility plans have been most frequently abandoned by individuals that expect the worse impact of the crisis on their future income. Finally, in France and Spain we did not observe a clear pattern for revision of fertility plans. These results suggest that different mechanisms are at work, due to the different economic, demographic and policy pre-crisis background and post-crisis prospects. Low-fertility contexts, in particular, appear to be more at risk of a fertility loss due to the crisis.",TRUE,2021-04-06,2020-05-22,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|covid|covid-19|crisis|fertility|fertility intentions|France|Germany|Italy|pandemic|sars-cov-2|Spain|UK|young people,2020-05-22T17:51:22.116013,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-22,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Francesca Luppi|Bruno Arpino|Alessandro Rosina,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/citation/,wr9jb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec6bf2217ac9e0047621812/,5ec6bf2217ac9e0047621812,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wr9jb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wr9jb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wr9jb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
8duvx,preprints,2020-05-20,Effects of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on Social Behaviours: From a Social Dilemma Perspective,"The health crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak has global impacts on humanity and the
economy. Such pandemic effects also influence human behaviour; issues of panic buying
(overbuying) and noncompliance with government orders and law among individuals are
evident. However, the underlying understanding of such behaviours due to the pandemic remains
unclear. Therefore, this perspective paper adopts the social dilemma theory and microeconomics
concepts to analyse and explain the effects of COVID-19 on social behavioural reactions. It
attempts to address the questions of what and why are the behaviours of individuals shown during
the coronavirus pandemic and showcase how the theory is associated with the current social
phenomena. Real scenarios based on media reporting from the sociodemographic context of
Malaysia, concerning the following issues; (i) competition over daily essentials; (ii) self-honesty
of individuals; and (iii) adherence to government policies and measures enforcement
(governance) were discussed. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate
interrelationships between social dilemma concepts and the phenomena. In essence, due to fear,
uncertainty, and greed, self-interest and opportunistic (defective/unethical) behaviours of most
individuals prevailing over societal collective interest amid the pandemic have been prevalently
observed in the above instances, although a cooperative choice can eventually result in a better
outcome for everyone. Not only do these non-cooperative behaviours of individuals create
inconveniences, dissatisfactions, and other forms of negative externalities, they also incentivise
others to act selfishly, if no restrictions are imposed, which may eventually cause government
intervention failures. This paper demonstrates the relevancy of the social dilemmas theory in
better understanding fundamental human behavioural reactions amid the health crisis and the
importance of incorporating the findings into government policymaking. These
sociopsychological considerations help the government formulate holistic measures, namely
stringent sanctions and monitoring enforcement, as well as incentivising cooperative and
compliant behaviours of the public, which then contribute to curbing the COVID-19 pandemic
more effectively.",TRUE,2020-05-21,2020-05-21,2020-04-25T16:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,effects of covd-19|Malaysia|Pandemic|Self-interest and opportunism|Social behaviours|Social Dilemma,2020-05-21T03:04:25.425670,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-21,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/citation/,8duvx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec56636c7d4ab00ea21bf26/,5ec56636c7d4ab00ea21bf26,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8duvx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8duvx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8duvx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
5jgzy,preprints,2020-05-20,"Socioeconomic inequality and COVID-19 prevalence across municipalities in Catalonia, Spain","This study provides preliminary evidence regarding associations between socioeconomic inequalities and variations in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases across 923 municipalities in Catalonia, Spain, as of the 14th of May, 2020. We consider three types of inequalities at municipality-level: 1) economic development, i.e., unemployment rate, average income, immigrants proportion, and the prevalence of small residence; 2) health vulnerability, i.e., crude death rate and the proportion of elderly (aged 65 +) population; and 3) information communication, i.e., the proportion of people with tertiary education. In addition to the static analysis with the total sum of COVID-19 cases, the dynamic analysis with daily moving weekly sum of cases is conducted. The result draws a rather complex picture of relationships between contextual socioeconomic inequalities and the spread of COVID-19. Many indicators of economic inequalities imply the opposite relationship as intuitively suggested: economically disadvantaged municipalities tend to have less cases of confirmed infection than economically advantaged counterparts. The implications from health inequality indicators show mixed patterns: crude death rate is positively associated, but elderly population is negatively associated, with the number of confirmed cases. The indicator of information inequality shows a consistent tendency, i.e., municipalities with more university educated have less confirmed cases, but this tendency transforms across time: the negative association is particularly strong during the first month of Spanish “state of alarm” measure (mid-March to mid-April). Our evidence suggests the need for more careful consideration regarding the association between socioeconomic inequalities and the regional progression of COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,2020-05-20,2020-05-20,2020-05-19T22:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Catalonia|COVID-19|Socioeconomic inequality,2020-05-20T12:02:22.290255,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-20,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/citation/,5jgzy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7z2da/,7z2da,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ec4d098c7d4ab009821dfe5/,5ec4d098c7d4ab009821dfe5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5jgzy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5jgzy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5jgzy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The pedagogical movement towards active learning has always found a friend in the natural sciences, with laboratory and field components being standard to many programs. For instructors of ecology and evolution, the shift to online-only learning planned for autumn 2020 imposes limitations. As a first-time instructor teaching a course on evolutionary processes at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, concurrent with being a student of a mentored teaching course and doctoral student in evolutionary ecology, I offer my perspective as a learner and an educator to guide decision-making by instructors. I emphasize the need to consider accessibility, equity, and compassion and the importance of building trust and a safe learning environment in the absence of face-to-face instruction. I describe some evolution-related resources and approaches to assessment I applied in the pivot-to-online context of March 2020, including COVID-19 teaching tools.

In our survey experiment (N=4,618), we randomize information provision on economic and health costs to assess public preferences over this trade-off in the UK and the US. People strongly prioritize health over wealth, but the treatment effects suggest these priorities will change as experience of COVID-19 deaths and income losses evolves.

hzj7a,preprints,2020-05-19,The Causal Effect of Social Distancing on the Spread of SARS-CoV-2,"To what degree does social distancing have a causal effect on the spread of SARS-CoV-2? To generate causal evidence, we show that week to week changes in weather conditions provided a natural experiment that altered daily travel and movement outside the home, and thus affected social distancing in the first several weeks when Covid-19 began to spread in many U.S. counties. Using aggregated mobile phone location data and leveraging changes in social distancing driven by weekly weather conditions, we provide the first causal evidence on the effect of social distancing on the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Results show that a 1 percent increase in distance traveled leads to an 8.1 percent increase in new cases per capita in the following week, and a 1 percent increase in non-essential visits leads to a 6.9 percent increase in new cases per capita in the following week.

nrjd3,preprints,2020-05-18,Sociodemographic Determinants of Occupational Risks of Exposure to COVID-19 in Canada,"The activities performed by Canadian workers in some occupations may increase the risk of exposure to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This research note explores how occupational exposure risks vary by labour force characteristics using publicly available Canadian data in combination with a dataset providing information on the level of physical proximity and frequency of exposure to infections or diseases faced by workers in different occupations. I find important sociodemographic differences. First, women work in occupations associated with significantly higher average risks of exposure to COVID-19 than men. This is driven by their over-representation in high-risk broad occupational categories such as health occupations. Second, older workers (65 years old or more), a group vulnerable to COVID-19, appear to work in occupations requiring performing activities that require a lower level of physical proximity than their younger colleagues, with minimal differences in the frequency of exposure to diseases or infections. Finally, workers in low-income occupations are employed in occupations that put them at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 than other workers. This is especially the case for women, immigrants and members of visible minority groups in low-income occupations.

People in the US, UK, and India are extremely concerned about the pandemic – both its health effects and economic repercussions – and they become even more concerned when primed with information about the repercussions of the virus. Yet, we find no evidence that these worries translate into changes in political behavior.

In an effort to quantify these changes, Google released an open-source dataset pertaining to regional mobility trends—including park visitation trends. This dataset offers vast application potential, containing aggregated information from location data collected via smartphones around the world. However, empirical analysis of these data is limited. Namely, the factors causing reported changes in mobility and the degree to which these changes can be directly attributable to COVID-19 remain unknown. The goal of this study is to address these gaps in our understanding of both the changes in park visitation and the causes of these changes. Results suggest that seasonality, not the COVID-19 pandemic, serves as the primary driver of reported changes in park visitation. Specifically, latitude-driven seasonal changes significantly influence visitation trends.

Reported case rates vary across counties from zero to 126 per thousand population (around a state prison in the rural county of Trousdale, Tennessee). Overall, rural counties are underrepresented relative to their share of the population, but a growing proportion of all daily cases and deaths have been reported in rural counties. This analysis uses daily reports for all counties to present the trends and distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural counties, from late March to May 21, 2020. I describe the relationship between population density and case rates in rural and non-rural counties. Then I focus on noteworthy outbreaks linked to prisons, meat and poultry plants, and nursing homes, many of which are linked to high concentrations of Hispanic, American Indian, and Black populations. The growing epidemic in rural counties is apparently driven by outbreaks concentrated in these institutional settings, which are conducive to transmission. The impact of the epidemic in rural areas may be heightened due to their weaker health infrastructure and more vulnerable populations, especially due to age, socioeconomic status, and health conditions.

In addition to physical health problems, COVID-19 is increasingly reported to be associated with mental health problems across populations. Evidence from the current pandemic and earlier infectious disease outbreaks suggests that several psychosocial factors, including fear and susceptibility of infection, stigma, lack of awareness, pre-existing health problems, and poor social support affect the mental health status among the vulnerable individuals and populations. Moreover, social determinants of mental health are disproportionately distributed across populations, which also affect coping with adverse psychosocial conditions.

z4m8t,preprints,2020-05-13,COVID-19 and Social Distancing Measures in Queensland Australia Are Associated with Short-Term Decreases in Recorded Violent Crime,"Since first diagnosed in late 2019, there have been more than 4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than a quarter of a million deaths worldwide. Not since the Spanish Flu in 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic and this has motivated many countries across globe to take a series of unprecedented actions in an effort to curb the spread and impact of the virus through the adoption of unprecedented domestic and international travel restrictions as well as stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. Whether these policies have altered criminal activity is an important question. In this study, we examine officially recorded violent crime rates for the month of March and April, 2020, as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute six-month-ahead forecasts of common assault, serious assault, sexual offense and domestic violence order breach rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95\% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March and April 2020. We conclude that by the end of April, rates of common, serious and sexual assault had declined to their lowest level in a number of years, and for serious assault and sexual assault the decline was beyond statistical expectations. The rate at which domestic violence orders were breached in Queensland has remained unchanged throughout the first two months of the pandemic.",TRUE,2020-05-13,2020-05-13,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Australia|COVID-19|Crime|Pandemic|Queensland|Routine Activities|Social Distancing|Violence,2020-05-13T12:11:01.058620,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-13,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Jason Payne,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/citation/,z4m8t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebbe1160238a90073336a3a/,5ebbe1160238a90073336a3a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4m8t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z4m8t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z4m8t,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
nbv79,preprints,2020-05-13,Modeling Reading Ability Gain in Kindergarten Children during COVID-19 School Closures,"By 15 April 2020, more than 1.5 billion students worldwide experienced school closures in an effort to slow the spread of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during the worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These interruptions in formal in-person educational experiences caused adverse consequences on school-age children’s academic outcomes. Using a pre-existing database, we calculated changes in children’s reading ability without formal education (i.e., the summer months). The resultant models predicted that the rate of reading ability gain in kindergarten children during COVID-19 school closures without formal in-person education will decrease 66% (2.46 vs. 7.17 points/100 days), compared to the business-as-usual scenario, resulting in a 31% less reading ability gain from 1 January 2020 to 1 September 2020. Additionally, the model predicted that kindergarten children who have books read to them daily would have 2.3 points less loss (42%) compared to those who do not, who are predicted to have a 5.6-point loss during the same time period. Even though reading books to children will not substitute the critical role of formal education in teaching children how to read, families, educators, and policy makers can promote this simple strategy to facilitate and maintain reading ability gain during school closures, which may be a common occurrence as nations see the public health benefits of physical distancing for the current and future pandemic outbreaks.",TRUE,2020-09-01,2020-05-13,2020-09-01T04:00:00,10.3390/ijerph17176371,TRUE,FALSE,book|children|closure|covid-19|education|literacy|loss|pandemic|parent|reading|school|student,2020-05-13T11:57:13.654097,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-13,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://nces.ed.gov/ecls/dataproducts.asp,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d54|Education|Elementary Education,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/citation/,nbv79,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ebb6642ec5a98005f23fc6f/,5ebb6642ec5a98005f23fc6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nbv79/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nbv79/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nbv79,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176371,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Several contingency plans warned police to expect a large and potentially overwhelming increase in demand from the public during a pandemic, but (to the author's knowledge) there is no empirical work on police demand during a major public-health emergency. This study used calls-for-service data from ten large cities in the United States to analyse how calls for service changed during the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, compared to forecasts of call volume based on data from previous years. Contrary to previous warnings, overall the number of calls went down during the early weeks of the pandemic. There were substantial reductions in specific call types, such as traffic collisions, and significant increases others, such as calls to dead bodies. Other types of call, particularly those relating to crime and order maintenance, continued largely as before. Changes in the frequency of different call types present challenges to law enforcement agencies, particularly since many will themselves be suffering from reduced staffing due to the pandemic.

vb5q3,preprints,2020-05-12,Jevons' paradox and a tax on aviation to prevent the next pandemic,"How is it possible that, in an era of unprecedented medical progress, humanity is once again caught in a major pandemic? Several lines of evidence suggest that advances in infectious diseases control facilitate the development of major urban centers, global high-speed transportation, industrial animal farming and ecosystem destruction. In turn, all of these are well known to favor such diseases, thus reproducing the same kind of dynamic observed in resource consumption and known as Jevons’ paradox. Such economic developments compel health systems to develop continuously just to maintain what had already been achieved, which, furthermore, becomes more difficult under neoliberal policies. The process involves massive cost-shifting to society from firms in, e.g., the aviation or meat sector, which materializes intermittently in disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A proposal is presented to prevent comparable events in the future, with two parts. First, a global fund with base funding from an internationally-agreed tax on aviation, devoted to upgrading health systems and to programs to tackle sources of emerging infectious diseases, especially wild animal trade. Second and no less important, a global agreement to fundamentally transform agri-food systems.

kbdum,preprints,2020-05-09,"Urban nature in a time of crisis: recreational use of green space increases during the COVID-19 outbreak in Oslo, Norway","The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it significant changes to human mobility patterns. We aimed to explore how social distancing measures affected recreational use of urban green space during the partial lockdown in Oslo, Norway. Mobile tracking data from thousands of recreationists were used to analyze high resolution spatio-temporal changes in activity. We estimated that outdoor recreational activity increased by 291% during lockdown relative to a 3-yr average for the same days. This increase was significantly greater than expected after adjusting for the prevailing weather and time of year and equates to approx. 86,000 extra activities per day over the municipality (population of 690,000). Both pedestrians (walking, running, hiking) and cyclists appeared to intensify activity on trails with higher greenviews and tree canopy cover, but with differences in response modulated by trail accessibility and social distancing preferences. The magnitude of increase was positively associated with trail remoteness, suggesting that green spaces facilitated social distancing and indirectly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Finally, pedestrian activity increased in city parks, peri-urban forest, as well as protected areas, highlighting the importance of access to green open spaces that are interwoven within the built-up matrix. These findings shed new light on the value of urban nature as resilience infrastructure during a time of crisis.

5tch8,preprints,2020-05-09,Trust in science and experts during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy,"Trust in science and experts is extremely important in times of epidemics to ensure compliance with public health measures. Yet little is known about how this trust evolves while an epidemic is underway. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of trust in science and experts in real-time as the high-impact epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) unfolds in Italy, by drawing on digital trace data from Twitter and survey data collected online via Telegram and Facebook. Both Twitter and Telegram data point to initial increases in reliance on and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities with the diffusion of the disease. Consistent with these increases, using a separately fielded online survey we find that knowledge about health information linked to COVID-19 and support for containment measures was fairly widespread. Trust in science, relative to trust in institutions (e.g. local or national government), emerges as a consistent predictor of both knowledge and containment outcomes. However, over time and as the epidemic peaks, we detect a slowdown and turnaround in reliance and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities, which we interpret as signs of an erosion in trust. This is supported by a novel survey experiment, which finds that those holding incorrect beliefs about COVID-19 give no or  lower importance to information about the virus when the source of such information is known to be scientific.",TRUE,2020-11-25,2020-05-11,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|digital traces|experts|pandemic|science|survey experiment|trust,2020-05-11T02:11:24.818548,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-11,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/citation/,5tch8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8bhn4/,8bhn4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb6b2d2a21995013f5d5d81/,5eb6b2d2a21995013f5d5d81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5tch8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5tch8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5tch8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
de9nc,preprints,2020-05-08,"Property Crime during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A comparison of recorded offence rates and dynamic forecasts (ARIMA) for March 2020 in Queensland, Australia","At the time of writing, there was 3.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 300,000 deaths worldwide. Not since the Spanish Flu in 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic and this has motivated many countries across globe to take unprecedented actions in an effort to curb the spread and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Among these government and regulatory interventions includes stringent domestic and international travel restrictions as well as a raft of stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. The scale of these containment measures has left criminologists wondering what impact this will have on crime in both the short- and long-term. In this study, we examine officially recorded property crime rates for March, 2020, as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute six-month-ahead forecasts of property damage, shop theft, other theft, burglary, fraud, and motor vehicle theft rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March 2020. We conclude that the observed rates of reported property offending across Queensland were significantly lower than expected for shop theft, other theft and credit-card fraud but statistically unchanged for property damage, burglary, and motor-vehicle theft.",TRUE,2020-05-11,2020-05-09,2020-05-07T14:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,arima|covid-19|forecast|property crime,2020-05-09T20:00:21.944057,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-09,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,Jason Payne and Anthony Morgan,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/citation/,de9nc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb5546ba2199501035da41a/,5eb5546ba2199501035da41a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/de9nc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/de9nc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/de9nc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Workers in these industries are hardest hit because few of them had continuous employment contracts before the pandemic, instead relying on non-standard and contingent arrangements including self-employment, subcontracting, and casual work. Non-standard workers typically lack entitlements such as annual, sick and carers leave. Of all hospitality workers, 65% are non-standard workers.

yatjc,preprints,2020-05-07,Concern About COVID-19 &amp; Support for Universal Vote by Mail,"With public health dangers of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) unlikely to subside by the Fall 2020, several states are considering implementing universal vote by mail systems in advance of the General Election. Studying Americans' demand for these policies is important, as support for universal vote by mail could place pressure on policymakers to implement policies that encourage turnout, without jeopardizing public health. Drawing on insights from social and political psychology, we theorize that -- while self-identified liberals are typically more likely to support vote-by-mail policies than conservatives  -- anxiety about COVID-19's health risks could erase these differences. In a demographically representative survey of U.S. adults conducted in late April 2020 (N = 1,015), we find strong ideological asymmetries in vote-by-mail support among individuals who are not concerned about COVID-19's health effects. However, and consistent with our theory, we find that highly-concerned liberals and conservatives alike are highly supportive of universal vote-by-mail. The results suggest that anxiety about the pandemic may play an important role in shaping demand for universal vote-by-mail policies, across the ideological spectrum.",TRUE,2020-05-08,2020-05-08,2020-05-07T05:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Political Psychology|Political Science|Public Opinion|Vote by mail|Voting,2020-05-08T12:00:00.671279,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-08,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/citation/,yatjc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nku47/,nku47,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb3f70da2199500a15d5aaa/,5eb3f70da2199500a15d5aaa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yatjc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yatjc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yatjc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study leverages this exogenous event to test key theoretical explanations of couples’ divisions of domestic labor. Using novel data from 1,025 partnered, different-sex US parents, our analysis shows an overall increase in domestic responsibilities for mothers, who were already doing most of the household labor, as well as an increase in fathers’ contributions. Driven by increases in fathers’ time spent on housework and childcare, we find that both mothers and fathers report a general shift toward more egalitarian divisions of household labor. Consistent with a time availability perspective, the findings indicate the relevance of increased time at home —due to unemployment, reduced work hours, and telecommuting— as a fundamental factor underlying change in parents’ division of domestic responsibilities.",TRUE,2020-10-10,2020-05-06,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,childcare|COVID-19|division of labor|gender|housework,2020-05-06T17:53:44.306754,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-06,FALSE,NA,no,Please contact authors directly to inquire about data access.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/citation/,jy8fn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb2e49f877c5e00523a1e10/,5eb2e49f877c5e00523a1e10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jy8fn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jy8fn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jy8fn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
y8hpr,preprints,2020-05-06,No clear association emerges between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 fatality rates from macro-level analyses,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, originated in Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019, rapidly spread in more than 100 countries. Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus, and deaths from the associated disease (COVID-19), in different geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists, have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. The goal of this article is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 cases in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support such a link. In fact, at the country-level higher prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and contacts is broadly positively associated with number of COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 persons), but the opposite is generally true at the sub-national level. While this inconsistent evidence neither demonstrates the existence nor the inexistence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data which suffer from many shortcomings. Only retrospective individual level data will provide robust evidence on the role of intergenerational ties. We conclude arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. From a theoretical point of view, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies devoted at fighting the spread of COVID-19 should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and “phase-2” restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.",TRUE,2020-08-03,2020-05-06,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,contacts|coresidence|coronavirus|covid|COVID_19|grandchild care|Intergenerational relationships|intergenerational ties|SARS-CoV-2,2020-05-06T18:33:17.086609,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-06,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/citation/,y8hpr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb298b5a2199500305d184e/,5eb298b5a2199500305d184e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/y8hpr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/y8hpr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8hpr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

6m85q,preprints,2020-05-06,Voluntary adoption of social welfare-enhancing behavior: Mask-wearing in Spain during the COVID-19 outbreak,"With the spread of COVID-19, more countries now recommend their citizens to wear facemasks in public. The uptake of facemasks, however, remains far from universal in countries where this practice lacks cultural roots. In this paper, we aim to identify the barriers to mask-wearing in Spain, a country with no mask-wearing culture. We conduct one of the first nationally representative surveys (n = 4,000) about this unprecedented public health emergency and identify the profile of citizens who are more resistant to face-masking: young, educated, unconcerned with being infected, and with an introverted personality. Our results further indicate a positive correlation between a social norm of mask-wearing and mask uptake and demonstrate that uptake of facemasks is especially high among the elderly living in localities where mask-wearing behavior is popular. These results are robust when controlling for respondents' demographics, time spent at home, and occupation fixed effects.

dghba,preprints,2020-05-05,The COVID-19 pandemic continues to change the way people recreate outdoors: A second preliminary report on a national survey of outdoor enthusiasts amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to alter daily life and lead to changes in the way we spend time outside. In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns before, during, and after the pandemic, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and its academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, have been working to conduct a study that can offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the United States. Phase 1 of this assessment was conducted April 9th – 11th, 2020 (Rice et al., 2020). Phase 2 of this assessment was conducted April 30th – May 2nd. This second phase of research—discussed in this preliminary report— was designed to provide additional information regarding changes in recreation trends since April 9th, which provides valuable information for managing dynamic recreational use on public lands. In total, 823 outdoor recreationists were surveyed through the Leave No Trace community in a 48-hour window beginning on the morning of April 30th. The results of this second rapid assessment—complete with comparisons to Phase 1 data—will provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world.

jb7gq,preprints,2020-05-04,Ethical Guidelines for Deliberately Infecting Volunteers with COVID-19,"Global fatalities related to COVID-19 are expected to be high in 2020-21. Developing and delivering a vaccine may be the most likely way to end the pandemic. If it were possible to shorten this development time by weeks or months, this may have a significant effect on reducing deaths. Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials could take less long to conduct if they used human challenge methods – that is, deliberately infecting participants with COVID-19 following inoculation.

This article analyses arguments for and against such methods and provides suggested broad guidelines for regulators, researchers and ethics committees when considering these matters. It concludes that it may be possible to maintain current ethical standards yet still permit human challenge trials in a context where delay is critical. The implications are that regulators and researchers need to work together now to design robust but short trials and streamline ethics approvals processes so that they are in place when applications for trials are made.",TRUE,2020-05-28,2020-05-05,2020-05-27T23:00:00,10.1136/medethics-2020-106322,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|human challenge trials|medical ethics|vaccine,2020-05-05T02:19:53.263406,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-05,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c15|Law|Science and Technology Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/citation/,jb7gq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eb0269a0ffc05010e6f6e4f/,5eb0269a0ffc05010e6f6e4f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb7gq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jb7gq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jb7gq,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106322,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Whilst the majority of cases in most states around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated amongst younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group.  This is despite the population’s rapidly ageing structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong Kong’s Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April, 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong Kong’s high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city.

8edbj,preprints,2020-05-02,Non-compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures among young adults: Insights from a longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Do young adults have low compliance rates with public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? This paper leverages a prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to examine this question.
Methods: Data came from an ongoing cohort study (n=737). Non-compliance with public health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20.
Findings: Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2 meters apart) was relatively lower. Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures, was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a non- migrant background. Non-compliance was associated with “antisocial potential,” including pre-pandemic low acceptance of moral rules, legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control, engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with low trust, including in the government’s measures for fighting the virus, also complied less.
Interpretation: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information. For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or nudging may increase compliance. Long-term investments into integrating antisocial youth into society may decrease rule-breaking behaviors, including during pandemics when compliance saves lives.",TRUE,2020-05-04,2020-05-02,2020-05-01T22:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,antisocial behavior|compliance|COVID-19|public health|social distancing,2020-05-04T15:04:51.485589,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/citation/,8edbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ead308869d3e10055de979f/,5ead308869d3e10055de979f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8edbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8edbj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8edbj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
4wtz8,preprints,2020-05-01,Household level health and socio-economic vulnerabilities and the COVID-19 crisis: An analysis from the UK,"Objectives. To investigate how COVID-19-related health and socio-economic vulnerabilities occur at the household level, and how they are distributed across household types and geographical areas in the United Kingdom. 
Design. Cross-sectional, nationally representative study. 
Setting.  The United Kingdom. 
Participants.  ~19,500 households. 
Main outcome measures. Using multiple household-level indicators and principal components analysis, we derive summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital. 
Results. Our analysis highlights three key findings. First, although COVID-19 health risks are concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with working-age households more likely to face financial, housing and employment precarities, and retirement-age households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution of vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. 
Conclusions. The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to vary by household type. Policy measures that aim to mitigate the health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider how vulnerabilities cluster together across different household types, and how these may exacerbate already existing inequalities.",TRUE,2020-05-10,2020-05-02,2020-04-30T23:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Health inequalities|Household|Principal Components Analysis|Socio-economic inequalities|United Kingdom|Vulnerability,2020-05-04T15:04:21.229802,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-05-02,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/citation/,4wtz8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eac3e9f69d3e10018de7d57/,5eac3e9f69d3e10018de7d57,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4wtz8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4wtz8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4wtz8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
w7gka,preprints,2020-04-30,"Minor covid-19 association with crime in Sweden, a ten week follow up","The covid-19 disease has a large impact on life across the globe, and this could potentially include impacts on crime. The present short report describes how crime has changed in Sweden during ten weeks after the government started to implement interventions to reduce spread of the disease. The first major interventions in Sweden were implemented in the end of week 11 in the year 2020, and we analyze police reported crimes through week 21. Descriptive statistics are provided relative to expected levels with 95 % confidence intervals for eight crime types.

hf32q,preprints,2020-04-30,Inequality in homeschooling during the Corona crisis in the Netherlands. First results from the LISS Panel.,"The outbreak of the Corona virus has led to unprecedented measures in education. 
From March 16, all schools in the Netherlands are closed, and children must keep up with their schoolwork from home. Parents are expected to take a crucial role in this “homeschooling”: they are primarily responsible for ensuring that their children follow the curriculum. In this article I report the first results of a module in the LISS Panel that was designed to map how parents school their children in primary and secondary education. Data on a nationally representative sample of 1,318 children in primary and secondary education were gathered in April. The results show marked differences between social groups. Whereas all parents find it important that their children keep up with the schoolwork, children from advantaged backgrounds receive much more parental support and have more resources (e.g., own computer) to study from home. Differences in parental support are driven by the ability to help: parents with a higher education degree feels themselves much capable to help their children with schoolwork than lower educated parents. Parents also report that schools provide more extensive distant schooling for children in the academic track in secondary education (vwo) than for children in the pre-vocational track (vmbo). Finally, there is a clear gender gap: parents feel much more capable to support their daughters than their sons.	These initial findings provide clear indications that the school shutdown in the Netherlands is likely to have strong effects on the inequality in educational opportunities.",TRUE,2020-05-04,2020-04-30,2020-04-29T22:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,corona|covid-19|education|homeschooling|inequality|netherlands|opportunity,2020-05-04T15:03:16.468200,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-30,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d82|Education|Online and Distance Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/citation/,hf32q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/k4r9w/,k4r9w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5eaa699be4f081026b0778f8/,5eaa699be4f081026b0778f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hf32q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hf32q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hf32q,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Not since the Spanish Flu in 1918 has the world experienced such a widespread pandemic and this has motivated many countries across globe to take a series of unprecedented actions in an effort to curb the spread and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Among these government and regulatory interventions includes unprecedented domestic and international travel restrictions as well as a raft of stay-at-home and social distancing regulations. Each has left criminologists wondering what impact this will have on crime in both the short- and long-term. In this study, we examine officially recorded violent crime rates for the month of March, 2020, as reported for the state of Queensland, Australia. We use ARIMA modeling techniques to compute six-month-ahead forecasts of common assault, serious assault, sexual offence and domestic violence order breach rates and then compare these forecasts (and their 95\% confidence intervals) with the observed data for March 2020.

Using three survey experiments, we examine the efficacy of different “face-saving” questions that aim to reduce social desirability in the measurement of compliance with public health measures. Our treatments soften the social norm of compliance by way of a short preamble in combination with a guilty-free answer choice making it easier for respondents to admit non-compliance.

ksefy,preprints,2020-04-27,Social inequality and the risk of being in a nursing home during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND
All available evidence suggests that the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 among those living in nursing homes is extremely high. Yet, it remains unknown to what extent there are socio-economic differences among nursing home residents, which can lead, in turn, to social inequality in mortality linked to COVID.

OBJECTIVE
We investigate whether there are educational differences in the likelihood of living in a nursing home across 13 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

METHODS
We use SHARE data (waves 5-7). We compute logistic regression models for rare events.

RESULTS
We find that there are sizeable differences in the probability of being in a nursing home, with low-educated individuals more likely to live in this kind of arrangement. This general pattern holds in all the European countries considered. There is considerable uncertainty in our estimates due to small Ns problems and firm conclusions on how the effect of education varies across countries cannot be drawn. Still, there is some indication that the largest educational differences are found in the Scandinavian countries and the smaller ones, even close to zero, in Southern European Countries, with countries in Continental Europe and Eastern Europe laying in between. 


CONTRIBUTION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides country specific evidence of educational differences in the probability of being in a nursing home in recent years. In this way, we also provide indirect evidence on social inequality in mortality linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.",TRUE,2020-05-04,2020-04-28,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Nursing homes|Social Inequalities,2020-05-04T15:01:09.124995,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-28,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/citation/,ksefy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea6d1a83854e200f569e15d/,5ea6d1a83854e200f569e15d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ksefy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ksefy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ksefy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

ep87s,preprints,2020-04-26,Initial evidence on the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial changes in the daily activities of millions of Americans, with many businesses and schools closed, public events cancelled and states introducing stay-at-home orders. This article used police-recorded open crime data to understand how the frequency of common types of crime changed in 16 large cities across the United States in the early months of 2020. Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of crime in previous years were used to forecast the expected frequency of crime in 2020 in the absence of the pandemic. The forecasts from these models were then compared to the actual frequency of crime during the early months of the pandemic. There were no significant changes in the frequency of serious assaults in public or (contrary to the concerns of policy makers) any change to the frequency of serious assaults in residences. In many cities, there were reductions in residential burglary but little change in non-residential burglary. In most cities, thefts of motor vehicles decreased while there were diverging patterns of thefts from motor vehicles.

The limits to growth elucidates that more symptomatic and asymptomatic patients owing to infected droplets may be bounded by self-healing and isolated treatments.

Many authors attributed the successful policies to the lessons learned by these countries during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2002.(Ohara, 2004) This manuscript provides a summary of recent early-stage policies that were successful in mitigating the spread and creating resilience against the negative consequences of COVID-19 in Taiwan and Vietnam. Crucially, these policies go beyond and complement social isolation. As social isolation is expected to have a negative socio-economic impact on the population and adherence is likely to decrease with time(Armitage and Nellums, 2020; Weems et al., 2020), it is important to consider a broad range of policies to promote a steady control of the COVID-19 spread.

zgbkr,preprints,2020-04-24,Head Start and Families’ Recovery from Economic Recession: Policy Recommendations for COVID-19,"Objective: This article examines whether the availability of Head Start during the Great Recession mitigated the impact of this crisis on poverty rates among families with young children.
Background: The first two decades of the 21st century have witnessed two major economic crises: the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Poverty rates among families with young children grew substantially during the Great Recession. Families with young children are also more vulnerable to instability during the COVID-19 pandemic as job losses have been steeper and childcare availability has been significantly curtailed. Programs like Head Start that support at-risk families may mitigate such negative consequences.
Method: This study uses data from the American Community Survey from 2006 through 2016 and state-level data on Head Start availability from Program Information Reports. Growth curve modeling is used to examine how the availability of Head Start predicted poverty growth during the Great Recession and the speed of recovery post-recession.
Results: States with higher rates of Head Start enrollment had a smaller increase in family poverty during the Great Recession and a more stable recovery than states with lower Head Start enrollment.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that greater access to Head Start programs prevented many families from falling into poverty and helped others exit poverty during the Great Recession.
Implications: The findings provide clear, evidence-based policy recommendations. Increased federal funding for Head Start is needed to support families during a COVID-19 recession. States should supplement these allocations to expand Head Start enrollment for all eligible families.",TRUE,2020-12-06,2020-04-25,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-04-25T00:47:40.676927,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://usa.ipums.org/usa/,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/citation/,zgbkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea2428441327c001bc81e81/,5ea2428441327c001bc81e81,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zgbkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zgbkr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zgbkr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
fudzq,preprints,2020-04-22,"Faith in Trump, Moral Foundations, and Social Distancing  Defiance During the Coronavirus Pandemic","Purpose: Over the past several months, the coronavirus has infected nearly 2 million Americans and killed more than 100,000. Governors have issued stay-at-home orders, and prosecutors have filed criminal charges against individuals for defying those orders. And yet, many Americans have still refused to keep their distance from their fellow citizens, even if they had symptoms of infection. This study explores the underlying causes for those who intend to defy these norms.
Methods: Using national-level data from a March 2020 survey of 989 Americans, we explore intentions to defy social distancing norms by testing an interactionist theory of foundation-based moral behavior in combination with faith in President Trump.  The analysis controls for a range of variables, including measures of low self-control and deterrence. 
Results: Low self-control is the strongest predictor of defiance intentions. Consistent with interactionist theory, defiance intentions are significantly higher for those holding a specific faith in Trump and those endorsing binding foundation.  Furthermore, the interaction of these two variables is significant and in the predicted direction. The results hold for two different measures of faith in Trump. 
Conclusions: Even with a strong effect for low self-control, faith in President Trump is a strong predictor of refusal to social distance, and its effect is largest among individuals high in binding foundations.",TRUE,2020-06-06,2020-04-25,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|moral foundations|pandemic|President Trump|social distancing,2020-04-25T00:39:43.730539,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-25,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/citation/,fudzq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ea059579fd598007956f12e/,5ea059579fd598007956f12e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fudzq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fudzq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fudzq,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

wdr5v,preprints,2020-04-20,Fake news in the time of environmental disaster: Preparing framework for COVID-19,"The increasing trend of environmental disaster due to changing climate has escalated the occurrence of Tsunami, Forest fire, Flood, Epidemics and other extreme health and environmental and hazardous events across the globe. Establishment of effective and transparent communication during the crisis phase is extremely important to reduce the after-effects of the events. In recent times, fake news or news with fabricated content have emerged as major threats of communications during and and post -disaster phase. The present study critically evaluates the nature and consequences of fake news spread during the four major environmental disasters in recent era (Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Keralan Flood, Amazon Forest Fire and African Ebola Epidemic) and prepared a framework for present COVID-19 Pandemic. The criticality and potential threat created by the fake news have been quantified and analyzed through the timeline of news spreading. It has been  observed that the adverse impact related to the African Ebola Epidemic was highest due to its multiple fake news origin sites, both online and offline propagation methods, well fabricated content and relatively low effort on containment. However the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing disaster expected to have a long- drawn impact covering most countries in the world with combined consequences hence it tends to overtake all other events.

The Changing Livelihood of US Online Workers in Times of COVID-19,"We draw on data from the Online Labour Index and interviews with freelancers in the United States securing work on online platforms, to illuminate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic’s global economic upheaval is shuttering shops and offices. Those able to do so are now working remotely from their homes. They join workers who have always been working remotely: freelancers who earn some or all of their income from projects secured via online labour platforms. Data allow us to sketch a first picture of how the initial month of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the livelihoods of online freelancers. The data shows online labour demand falling rapidly in early March 2020, but with an equally rapid recovery. We also find significant differences between countries and occupations.

arw7c,preprints,2020-04-20,Transforming Economies and Generating Sustainable “Green” Economic Growth After the COVID-19 Pandemic through General Collective Intelligence,"The lockdown of economic activity in many countries as a measure to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of unemployment and other indicators of a potentially upcoming economic crisis. As a gauge of the seriousness of these concerns some have suggested that current levels of some of these indicators have not been seen in the US since the time of the great depression. This paper explores how General Collective Intelligence, a recent innovation in group decision-making systems, might reliably generate the economic growth needed to avert such a crisis where not reliably achievable otherwise. Current group decision-making systems, whether choosing a human decision-maker, consensus voting on decisions, or automated decision-systems such as conventional collective intelligence, have been suggested to lack the capacity to maximize more than a very few group outcomes simultaneously due to specific limitations. Since impact on collective well-being is determined by impact on an open (unbounded) set of outcomes, this implies lack of the capacity to maximize the necessary range of impacts on well-being for groups if that range is too broad. If so, the breadth of impact required to achieve sustainable “green” economic development while simultaneously solving hunger, solving the environmental degradation that consensus has linked to climate change, as well as providing maximal access to healthcare, education, and other resources, may not be reliably possible with current decision systems. General Collective Intelligence or GCI replicates the adaptive problem solving mechanisms by which nature has demonstrated the ability to optimally respond to an unlimited set of problems, and by which nature has demonstrated the ability to potentially increase sustainability per unit of resources by orders of magnitude so that life is reliably self-sustaining. This paper explores why GCI can potentially be used to reliably drive self-sustaining economic growth to revive economies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and why GCI has the potential to reliably drive a transformation to sustainable green economies while doing so.",TRUE,2020-04-21,2020-04-20,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,economic development|GCI|General Collective Intelligence|green growth|sustainable development,2020-04-21T05:03:24.280023,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/citation/,arw7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9d50a8f1353506b3d599c3/,5e9d50a8f1353506b3d599c3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/arw7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/arw7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/arw7c,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
scnza,preprints,2020-04-20,COVID-19 and The Hidden Cost of Reduced Civil Liberties,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak that emerged from Wuhan, China in 2020 has seen unprecedented restrictions on civilian populations in many countries in the attempt to curtail the spread of the pandemic. A recently developed model of general collective intelligence predicts the properties of group decision-making systems that are required to optimize collective outcomes, along with predicting that authoritarian systems of decision-making might tend to be restricted to non-optimal group outcomes in ways that are somewhat hidden in that they require an understanding of this new and relatively unknown model of general collective intelligence. In light of this model of general collective intelligence, the economic restrictions imposed to combat the pandemic take on a new light, since these restrictions have not only resulted in economic lockdowns for some countries, but in some cases have also effectively imposed martial law. The hidden cost of this reduction in civil liberties is explored from the perspective of the cost of an authoritarian decision-making system resulting in non-optimal group outcomes as theorized by this model of general collective intelligence, using models of government inefficiency to assess the cost of those non-optimal group outcomes, and therefore the hidden cost of reduced civil liberties.",TRUE,2020-04-21,2020-04-20,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Civil Liberties|coronavirus|COVID-19|GCI|General Collective Intelligence,2020-04-21T05:03:22.518737,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dee|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Emergency and Disaster Management",Andy E.

a8r3p,preprints,2020-04-17,How Right-Leaning Media Coverage of COVID-19 Facilitated the Spread of Misinformation in the Early Stages of the Pandemic,"In recent weeks, several academic and journalistic outlets have documented widespread misinformation about the origins and potential treatment for COVID-19. This misinformation could have important public health consequences if misinformed people are less likely to heed the advice of public health experts. While some have anecdotally tied the prevalence of misinformation to misleading or inaccurate media coverage of the pandemic in its early stages, few have rigorously tested this claim empirically. In this paper, we report the results of an automated content analysis showing that right-leaning news outlets (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart) were more than 2.5 times more likely than mainstream outlets to discuss COVID-19 misinformation during the early stages of the U.S. pandemic response. In a nationally representative survey (N = 8,914) conducted from 3/10-3/16, we then show that people who consumed more right-leaning news during this timeframe were more than twice as likely to endorse COVID-related misinformation. Alarmingly, survey data further suggest that misinformation endorsement has negative public health consequences, as misinformed people are more likely to believe that the CDC is exaggerating COVID-related health risks.",TRUE,2020-04-19,2020-04-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,conspiracy theories|content analysis|coronavirus|COVID|COVID-19|media effects|misinformation|partisan media|political communication|political science|science communication|survey research,2020-04-19T05:03:21.485641,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/citation/,a8r3p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/4hdgw/,4hdgw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e9a1183f1353505c2d54f85/,5e9a1183f1353505c2d54f85,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a8r3p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a8r3p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a8r3p,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
7pykj,preprints,2020-04-17,Prospect Theory in Times of a Pandemic: The Effects of Gain versus Loss Framing on Policy Preferences and Emotional Responses During the 2020 Coronavirus Outbreak,"During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, citizens and governments across the globe relied heavily on the legacy media: Not only to inform people about fast-paced developments in the midst of a crisis, but also to stimulate compliance with strict interventions. Prospect theory postulates that gain versus loss framing may affect preferences for different interventions. In a conceptual replication of Tversky and Kahneman’s seminal prospect theory, findings from surveys in the US and the Netherlands (N = 1,121) demonstrate that gain frames of the coronavirus promote support for risk-aversive interventions, whereas loss frames result in more support for risk-seeking alternatives. Beyond these preferences, gain frames yield slightly more support for strict interventions such as a lockdown than loss frames. Loss frames elicit stronger negative emotions, such as frustration and powerlessness. The experience of powerlessness, in turn, mediates the effects of loss versus gain frames on support for stricter interventions. Together, these findings indicate that framing the pandemic in terms of gains may be most effective in promoting support for the strict preventative measures that have been taken throughout the globe.",TRUE,2020-04-19,2020-04-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|discrete emotions|equivalency framing|gain framing|loss framing|policy support|prospect theory,2020-04-19T05:04:47.120072,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,Michael Hameleers,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/citation/,7pykj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e999fa7f135350574d539c5/,5e999fa7f135350574d539c5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pykj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pykj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pykj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

xcm7y,preprints,2020-04-16,Out of the lockdown: democratic trust in the management of epidemic crises,"This paper presents a preliminary inquiry into the democratic role of trust in the management of epidemic crises, by shedding some light on one dimension political theory has systematically neglected, which is trust of elites in citizens. The paper proceeds as follows. After an introduction, the first section distinguishes two dimensions of political trust.

65pgr,preprints,2020-04-16,COVID-19: Insights from Innovation Economists (with French executive summary),"The present document provides the take of innovation economists on the current pandemic. It is addressed to the general public and focuses on questions related to the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) ecosystem. It does not present new research findings. Instead, it provides a reading of current real-world developments using economic reasoning and relying on existing economic research.

The first part of the report explains the root causes for a general underinvestment in Research and Development (R&amp;D), with a particular focus on vaccines. These causes include an insufficient demand for vaccines in normal times and the very characteristics of R&amp;D. Governments can intervene to mitigate these problems, but government intervention comes with its own set of issues. We discuss three of them, namely free riding, setting research priorities, and acting on scientific knowledge.

The second part discusses several aspects related to current STI policy reactions. First, we observe a sizable shift of funds towards research on SARS-CoV-2. Aren’t we wasting money by allocating so much of it on one single scientific problem? Using the concept of the ‘elasticity of science,’ we argue that we are far from a situation where additional funding would represent a waste of money.

Second, we also observe an unprecedented level of cooperation among researchers but also an intense competition to find therapeutic solutions and vaccines. We seek to make sense of this apparent antonymy, highlighting how both cooperative and competitive forces might accelerate research.

Third, we focus on one policy tool, namely patents, and we discuss whether the existence of patents hampers the search for a solution. We argue that it might, but we provide ways in which patents can be beneficial. They can accelerate research (such as through patent pools) or ensure greater access to innovations (such as with compulsory licensing).

Fourth, we notice that the whole STI ecosystem has been rapidly refocusing on SARS-CoV-2 in a way similar to mission-oriented R&amp;D (MOR) programs such as the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. We highlight the fundamental differences between MOR and the present situation. Today’s response is characterized by a proliferation of a wide range of innovative solutions offered by a complex set of institutions and actors with great intellectual freedom and decentralized competition.

The third part of the report assesses some potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly discuss its impact on R&amp;D investment. We explain how innovation might be negatively affected by a prolonged economic downturn and highlight the crucial role of stimulus packages in confronting the recession. We also address the influence of the crisis on ICT, arguing that it has been a formidable catalyst for ICT adoption. Next, we focus on clean technologies, another major societal challenge besides the pandemic. There are strong reasons for why cleantech investment may suffer. However, the crisis also offers significant opportunities to accelerate the green transition. Finally, we focus on open science, in particular on open access and open data. The current crisis could be a catalyst for the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Practices.

The last part of the report offers some concluding thoughts. The STI policy response cannot be limited to the urgent need for ‘technological fixes.’ A second line of response involves the production of new knowledge to prevent outbreaks (ex-ante) or mitigate their effects (ex-post). Furthermore, the current crisis is a reminder that all branches of science matter. The pandemic has many facets, and a significant number of scientific disciplines can contribute to dealing with it. We conclude with a forward-looking note, arguing that the most substantial impact of the pandemic may lie outside of the public health realm or the science system.

bfvxt,preprints,2020-04-16,The COVID-19 pandemic in an aging world,"Since death rates from the COVID-19 are highest among the oldest, the impact of the current pandemic in a given society depends to a large extent on the share of elderly persons and their living arrangements. Whereas the former is well known, the latter is not. Arguably, contagion itself and the severity of its symptoms are likely to vary among elderly persons living alone, co-residing with family members or dwelling in institutions. Arguments in favour and against the premise that single-living elderly are better able to self-isolate can be made. Long-term care facilities have worsened the effects of the epidemic because they have often become death traps in some but not all countries. Once contagion takes place, living arrangements can make a huge difference in the way the disease can be managed by the individual, his family and society.

We performed an exploratory study to examine how travellers perceive the risk-related to COVID-19 and how the outbreak has affected their commuting and non-commuting travel activities. Building on previous studies, we propose a working hypothesis of personal risk perception and trip adjustment decision and collect information to preliminary check our hypothesis. We report on our work, and the results of an online survey carried out between March 12-19, 2020, which collected 71 responds from countries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Middle East in this working paper. 
Our results illustrate how the respondents altered their travel, their rationales, the precautionary actions they took, their foremost concerns, the sources of information they based their decisions on, and how useful they found teleconference as an alternative. Also, we observed their risk-related perception concerning the proposed model.

sb8xn,preprints,2020-04-13,The influence of social and economic ties to the spread of COVID-19 in Europe,"Background: By late January 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) had reached Europe and most European countries had registered cases by March 1. However, the spread of the virus has been uneven in both prevalence and speed of its propagation. Given the role of social factors in the spread of contagious diseases and the known demographic, economic and cultural differences in Europe, we analyse the contribution of such factors in the coronavirus disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Methods: Diagnosed COVID-19 cases from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and the European Social Survey for 20 European countries were used to estimate bivariate associations between cumulative reported case numbers ten-day intervals during March 2020 and ten social, demographic and economic variables. To avoid overfitting, we first reduce these variables to three factors (labelled “socially and economically vibrant”, “high-educated and not aged”, and “densely populated and traditional”) by means of factor analysis before conducting a multiple regression analysis. We also perform a sensitivity analyses using rates and new cases between two time periods.
Findings: The socially and economically vibrant factor has a strong and positive association with COVID-19 throughout the study period. The association with the densely populated and traditional factor was initially low but by mid-March similar to the socially and economically vibrant factor.
Conclusions: For future influenza-like pandemics where a vaccine is not yet available, early movement restrictions will be especially crucial to curb the spread of such diseases in economically, socially, and culturally vibrant and densely populated countries.",TRUE,2021-04-07,2020-04-14,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID19|Europe|Social tie,2020-04-14T05:03:50.469704,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/citation/,sb8xn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ea248/,ea248,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e947916430166037ba07fa9/,5e947916430166037ba07fa9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sb8xn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sb8xn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sb8xn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
e2hfa,preprints,2020-04-13,Do socio-economic indicators associate with COVID-2019 cases? Findings from a Philippine study,"Background: A wide spectrum of indicators has been postulated to associate with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-2019) cases. Among which were demographic profile, latitude, humidity, temperature, and ozone concentration. Despite obtaining significant results, there is still a dearth of research exploring other substantial determinants of Covid-2019 cases. The Philippine government is currently challenged to address issues pertaining to poverty and substinence. Empirical evidence of these studies suggests how identification of potential indicators could aid in the formulation of targeted strategies to mitigate future health problems. In this study, seven socio-economic indicators were associated with Covid-2019 cases across 17 regions in the Philippines. This is a retrospective study utilizing readily accessible public data in the analysis. Socio-economic indicators used were poverty incidence, magnitude of poor families, substinence incidence, and magnitude of substinence poor population. In addition, the income, expenditure, and savings recorded per Philippine region were taken for the analysis. A single Philippine region was the sampling unit; hence, a total of 17 regions were assessed. Covid-2019 cases as of April 7, 2020 were considered for the analysis. Descriptive statistics, Kendall rank correlation, and stepwise regression were used to determine if the seven socio-economic indicators were associated with Covid-2019 cases. Substinence incidence and income were retained for the regression model, which explained 87.2 percent of the variance in the Covid-2019 cases (R2 = .872). The results indicated that for every 1,000 PhP increase in income, there was a decrease of 3.99 Covid-2019 cases in each Philippine region. Meanwhile, for every 1.0 percent increase in substinence incidence, there was an increase of 3.34 Covid-2019 cases in each Philippine region. High income and low substinence incidence are associated with significant reductions in Covid-2019 cases across the 17 regions of the Philippines. This provides additional knowledge to policy makers and health officials in formulating targeted strategies to regions that could potentially record high number of Covid-2019 cases in the future. Early identification of these high-risk regions would warrant prompt preventive measures. Given the seasonal and recurring nature of Covid-2019 with respect to previous outbreaks, it is essential for the Philippine government to formulate directed policies and innovate programs that would decrease substinence and increase income. Concerted multi-region efforts should be made to prepare for possible infection outbreaks in the future. Additional studies could be explored in the future to capture significant changes in the socio-economic indicators.",TRUE,2020-04-14,2020-04-14,2020-04-08T16:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Covid-2019|expenditure|income|novel coronavirus|poverty|SARS-CoV-2|savings|socio-economic|substinence,2020-04-14T05:03:32.200080,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/citation/,e2hfa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e946466d69735038ebd9e4d/,5e946466d69735038ebd9e4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e2hfa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e2hfa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e2hfa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
uwdr6,preprints,2020-04-10,A review of infectious disease surveillance to inform public health action against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic exposed the inadequacy of infectious disease surveillance throughout the US and other countries. Isolation and contact tracing to identify all infected people are key public health interventions necessary to control infectious disease outbreaks. However, these activities are dependent upon the surveillance platform to identify infections quickly. A robust surveillance platform can also reinforce community adherence to behavioral interventions such as social distancing. In situations where contact tracing is feasible, all suspected cases and contacts of confirmed cases must be tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectively isolated. At the community level wastewater surveillance can identify areas where transmission is or is not occurring, and genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can help to elucidate the intensity of transmission independent of the number of known cases and hospitalizations. State and county public health departments should improve the infectious disease surveillance platform whilst the public is practicing social distancing. These enhanced surveillance activities are necessary to contain the epidemic once the curve has been sufficiently flattened in highly burdened areas, and to prevent escalation in areas where transmission is minimal.",TRUE,2020-04-12,2020-04-12,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,control|Coronavirus|COVID-19|infectious disease|SARS-CoV-2|surveillance,2020-04-12T03:27:50.093913,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/citation/,uwdr6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e90dd11d6973502d5bdad19/,5e90dd11d6973502d5bdad19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uwdr6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uwdr6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uwdr6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizens’ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential “explosion” in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on Canadians’ views about the crisis. We report results from a survey experiment conducted in April 2020 with a sample of 2500 respondents.

a32r7,preprints,2020-04-10,Voting at the dawn of a global pandemic,"What is the impact of a global health crisis on political behavior? We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on electoral choice based on the case of Germany, one of the countries most heavily affected by the crisis. Our data come from the German state of Bavaria, where local elections were held right at the beginning of the pandemic. The elections took place early during the outbreak when there was still substantial variation in the extent to which individual counties and municipalities were affected by the outbreak. This variation provides a unique opportunity to study the causal impact of an event that would shortly after grow into an all-encompassing epidemic. We provide evidence that shows that the disease spread across the state in a mostly haphazard fashion. This lack of a discernible pattern coupled with within-county estimation of effects and a difference-in-differences strategy allow us to causally asses the effect of the spreading of the virus on electoral outcomes. Our results show that the crisis strongly and consistently benefited the dominant regional party, the CSU, and its candidates. For 3 known cases per 100,000 inhabitants, vote shares increased by about 4 percent.

9pn27,preprints,2020-04-09,Policing the Pandemic: Tracking the Policing of Covid-19 across Canada,"The Policing the Pandemic Mapping Project was launched
on 4 April, 2020 to track and visualize these massive and
extraordinary expansions of police power and the unequal
patterns of enforcement they are likely to produce. In doing
so, we hope that we can bring to light patterns of police
intervention, to help understand who is being targeted, what
justifications are being used by police, and how marginalized
people are being impacted. More broadly, we hope the
project will inform a larger conversation about the role of
policing in society, to scrutinize public health and police
collaboration, and to focus attention toward the harms of
criminalization. Having an understanding of these patterns in
coming weeks will help inform approaches to actively resist
the logic and practices of policing crisis and disease, rather
than allow them to become widespread and normalized.
Through the acts of identifying, reporting, and visualizing
events related to the policing of COVID-19, the project
offers a living repository of publicly accessible data that can
be used by activists, academics, journalists, and community
members to analyze, discuss, and challenge the policing of
disease. We encourage all people to use the data available

yndb7,preprints,2020-04-08,"Digital Pathways, Pandemic Trajectories. Using Google Trends to Track Social Responses to COVID-19","We already know which countries have controlled the spread of COVID-19 better and what “good practices” have enabled them to do so. Eventually, some of these policies could be replicated in other countries. But it is not enough to make a well-informed public intervention. We also need quickly available indicators of how actively populations are responding to the virus threat because current changes in social behaviour could mean significant differences in the spread of the COVID-19 in two weeks (after the incubation period). In this article, Pablo Beytía Reyes and Carlos Cruz Infante explore the potential of Google Trends to quickly track social responses to the pandemic. In all the countries that have reached a downward changepoint in the COVID-19 contagion, an “information saturation peak” preceded it: people were massively searching for information on the subject over 2 to 5 days, and about a week after the peak of searches was reached, a decline in the growth trend of coronavirus confirmed cases could be observed. Does it make sense to associate a Google search boom with a decrease in transmission trends? The authors propose that the frequency of searches is a quick indicator of 1) people’ concerns on the virus, 2) the development of a more informed citizenry on how to avoid transmission and 3) active social response to the virus spread, which generally lead to a downward change in the contagion trend.",TRUE,2020-04-27,2020-04-08,2020-04-07T22:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,coronavirus|COVID-19|crisis management|digital methods|digital trace analysis|epidemic|healthcare policy|public policy|social indicators,2020-04-08T13:31:45.652362,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-08,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e24|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/citation/,yndb7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8dc333d697350194bda664/,5e8dc333d697350194bda664,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yndb7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yndb7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yndb7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet, in the United States, one fifth of individuals say they wear masks at most some of the time, and a majority say that people in their community wear masks at most some of the time. What strategies most effectively encourage compliance with this critical covid-19 prevention measure? Relying on social identity theory, we experimentally assess two possible mechanisms of compliance, elite endorsement and social norms, among a representative sample of White U.S.–born Evangelicals, a group that has shown resistance to prevention measures. We find evidence for both mechanisms, but social norms play a remarkably important role – increasing support for mask-wearing by 6% with spillover effects on other prevention guidelines.

tzm9n,preprints,2021-04-19,"Bereavement from COVID-19, Gender, and Reports of Depression among Older Adults in Europe","Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has left older adults around the world bereaved by the sudden death of relatives and friends. We examine if COVID-19 bereavement corresponds with older adults’ reporting depression in 27 countries, and test for variation by gender and country context.
Methods: We analyze SHARE COVID-19 data collected between June-August 2020 from N=51,383 older adults (age 50–104) living in 27 countries, of whom 1,363 reported the death of a relative or friend from COVID-19. We estimate pooled-multilevel logit regression models to examine if COVID-19 bereavement was associated with self-reported depression and worsening depression, and we test whether national COVID-19 mortality rates moderate these assocations. 
Results: COVID-19 bereavement is associated with significantly higher probabilities of both reporting depression and reporting worsened depression among older adults. Net of one’s own personal loss, living in a country with the highest COVID-19 mortality rate is associated with women’s reports of worsened depression but not men’s. However, the country’s COVID-19 mortality rate does not moderate associations between COVID-19 bereavement and depression.

Os dados apresentados neste documento mostram que o primeiro caso foi confirmado na capital Manaus em 13 de março de 2020. Apenas 10 dias depois, em 23 de março, enquanto Manaus registrou 31 casos, era confirmado o primeiro caso no interior, em Parintins. No dia seguinte, Amazonas apresentou o primeiro óbito, justamente em Parintins. Ao que se sabe no momento, o atual coronavírus (SARS-COV-2) provoca uma síndrome respiratória aguda grave (covid-19) e é transmitido de humano para humano sendo capaz de causar doença respiratória grave (Croda; Garcia, 2020). O que mais chama atenção e causa preocupação é que a covid-19 se distingue pela capacidade de transmissão a partir de casos assintomáticos (Munster et al, 2020). A seguir, são apresentados dados e também as informações sobre como foram gerados estes mapas e informações nas seções de fonte de dados e metodologia de trabalho. Uma breve apresentação e discussão dos resultados também é apresentada com enfoque na rápida dispersão e difusão espacial do vírus apresentada no país e no Estado do Amazonas.

Despite the global scale of the problem, the response has been mainly national, and global coordination has been so far extremely weak.

Relief packages to mitigate the economic consequences of the lockdowns are being discussed, and there is little doubt that the forthcoming recession will have important distributive consequences. In this paper we study citizens' responses to these democratic dilemmas. We present results from a set of survey experiments run in Spain from March 20 to March 28, together with longitudinal evidence from a panel survey fielded right before and after the virus outbreak. Our findings reveal a strong preference for a national as opposed to a European/international response. The national bias is much stronger for the COVID-19 crisis than for other global problems, such as climate change or international terrorism. We also find widespread demand for strong leadership, willingness to give up individual freedom, and a sharp increase in support for technocratic governance. As such, we document the initial switch in mass public preferences towards technocratic and authoritarian government caused by the pandemic. We discuss to what extent this crisis may contribute to a shift towards a new, self-enforcing political equilibrium.",TRUE,2020-04-06,2020-04-06,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Covid-19; Democratic preferences; Technocracy; Authoritarianism; Pandemics,2020-04-06T03:08:02.334360,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-06,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/citation/,dkusw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8a5155f13535005bd5bc7f/,5e8a5155f13535005bd5bc7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dkusw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dkusw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dkusw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

5kdbx,preprints,2020-04-04,What can scholars learn from Open Source software communities during pandemics,"When the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began on January 31, 2020, no-one could have anticipated the impact that it would have on our scholarly communication and publishing systems. That is, perhaps, unless you work on open source software. Right now, global research communities are united to collaborate on solving the threat of the pandemic, sharing resources and knowledge more efficiently and effective than ever before, a process broadly described as ‘open scholarship’ (Dunleavy, 2020). This is essentially akin to how free and open source software (FOSS) communities have been operating now for decades (Willinsky, 2005). Recently, we participated in a “massively open online paper”, or MOOP, that explored the intersections between FOSS and open scholarship (Tennant, Agarwal, et al., 2020). Here, we want to summarise our key findings from that project, and place them in the context of the current outbreak. Critically, this pandemic shows us that many of the pervasive and systemic issues surrounding the evaluation, valuation, use and operationalisation of “openness” in scholarship can be extremely easily bypassed when the social demand and urgency is there, thus showing that the primary barriers towards open scholarship are inherently political and not technical.",TRUE,2020-04-04,2020-04-04,2020-04-03T16:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Communities|Coronavirus|FOSS|Free Software|Global Health|Open Data|Open Research|Open Scholarship|Open Science|Open Source|Pandemic|Peer review|Preprints|Public Health|Research evaluation|SARS-CoV-2|Software,2020-04-04T17:42:40.654364,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Publishing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Scholarly Communication,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/citation/,5kdbx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e8818f9d69735000cbe17b7/,5e8818f9d69735000cbe17b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kdbx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kdbx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kdbx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

gtw2x,preprints,2020-04-02,"Public actors without public values: legitimacy, domination and the regulation of the technology sector","The scale and asymmetry of commercial technology firms’ power over people through data, combined with the increasing involvement of the private sector in public governance, means that increasingly people do not have the ability to opt out of engaging with technology firms. At the same time, those firms are increasingly intervening on the population level in ways that have implications for social and political life. This creates the potential for power relations of domination, and demands that we decide what constitutes the legitimacy to act on the public. Business ethics and private law are not designed to answer these questions, which are primarily political. If people have lost the right to disengage with commercial technologies, we may need to hold the companies that offer them to the same standards to which we hold the public sector. This paper therefore argues for the development of an overarching normative framework for what constitutes non-domination with regard to digital technologies. Such a framework must involve a nuanced idea of political power and accountability that can respond not only to the legality of corporate behaviour, but to its legitimacy.",TRUE,2020-11-06,2020-04-03,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,big data|coronavirus|data protection|governance|legitimacy|non-domination|privacy|public administration,2020-04-03T19:01:53.247473,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-03,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy",NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/citation/,gtw2x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e858c3ed0e35401e9b49152/,5e858c3ed0e35401e9b49152,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gtw2x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gtw2x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gtw2x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
jp4wk,preprints,2020-04-01,"Fear, Partisanship and the Spread of COVID-19 in the United States","In this paper we argue that the sociopolitical context of the COVID-19 pandemic is as important for understanding the spread of the disease as more conventional factors like social distancing policies and the capacity of the health care system. To do so, we analyze COVID-19 case and test data from the fifty United States during the first seven months on the pandemic. We also devise a Bayesian modeling approach for semi-parametric identification of the infection rate that permits us to undertake more sophisticated covariate adjustment than previous studies, incorporating mediation analysis to better understand why and how sociopolitical, economic and demographic factors affected different channels of transmission.

j4a3d,preprints,2020-03-31,Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality,"The population-level case-fatality rate (CFR) associated with COVID-19 varies substantially, both across countries time and within countries over time. We analyze the contribution of two key determinants of the variation in the observed CFR: the age-structure of diagnosed infection cases and age-specific case-fatality rates. We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late April 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 13.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 13.0% between March 9 and April 22, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.",TRUE,2021-04-27,2020-04-01,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Age structure|Case fatality rate|COVID-19|Decomposition,2020-04-01T14:02:02.537149,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-04-01,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,NA,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/citation/,j4a3d,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/vdgwt/,vdgwt,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e82fe468140b40118429cac/,5e82fe468140b40118429cac,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j4a3d/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j4a3d/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j4a3d,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

zus5h,preprints,2020-03-23,the Butterfly Effect: Coronavirus may Redefine the Global Currency Landscape,"In Trump’s political viewpoint, all problems within the U.S. were caused by external problems, such as the rise of China, and thus Trump has rejected globalism and took on the policy of ‘America First’. Trump’s policy inevitably leads to the decoupling between the U.S. and China, and the recent coronavirus outbreak may catalyze the decoupling process.

hqt65,preprints,2021-04-19,Rumors and the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The issue of rumors associated with COVID-19 has gained importance in Punjab in North India. This is associated with a surge in numbers of patients, reluctance of people to cooperate with health care personnel and the arrest of people for rumor mongering. 
Methods: We accessed messages with content pertaining to rumors about COVID-19 being forwarded through WhatsApp (a popular messaging app in India). 
Findings: A content analysis of the messages suggests that they are brief, easily understandable, forwarded in text, audio and video formats. The messages pertain to the nature of COVID-19, the motivations of the government and health care agencies, and that people should avoid getting tested and getting admitted. 
Interpretation: Messages spread via WhatsApp represent an anonymous, efficient and encrypted vehicle for spreading rumors. There is a need to counter this phenomenon.

aqhe5,preprints,2021-04-18,LET'S SPEND THE NIGHT TOGETHER: A Challenge for Medically Optimal Coronavirus Social Distancing Policies,"Public health efforts to slow the COVID-19 epidemic and protect the vulnerable have focused on reducing interpersonal contact and increasing interpersonal physical distance. They have achieved considerable success, with over three-quarters of Americans reporting that they follow all the recommended precautionary practices of social distancing, so it is likely that, at least, they follow most of them most of the time. But there is an elephant in the room: Overnighting – staying overnight at someone else’s home or having them stay overnight at your place is rarely, if ever, mentioned publicly. But we will show that this is a widespread practice in American society, throughout the epidemic thus far. In the past month, over half of all Americans had at least one overnight guest and about the same number (but not always the same people) spent at least one night in the past month at somebody else's home. The consequences are striking:  People who overnight are more than twice as likely to report that they have had COVID-19. Who overnights? The practice is much more common among young adults (over 60% for those 25-34) than among their seniors (dipping below 30% for those age 65 and over). Moreover, risk seekers are hugely more likely to overnight than are their otherwise similar risk averse peers.

q9uzx,preprints,2021-04-18,Public opinion on coronavirus vaccination:  Health Implications of Americans' surprisingly widespread acceptance of early Russian and Chinese vaccines,"In the US, new vaccines are banned until accepted as safe and effective by the FDA. But the approval process is slow and cautious. The faster, but perhaps riskier, Russian system (like the Chinese) produced an approved coronavirus vaccine months more quickly, leaving Americans at risk of dying for months longer than Russians. Despite widespread fears that many would be hesitant to accept vaccination at all, and understandable doubts about vaccine approval processes outside the US, data from two national surveys in September 2020 show, very surprisingly, that a majority of Americans at that time would have willingly taken the Russian  vaccine. Moreover a two-to-one majority of Americans – rich and poor, young and old, Democrat and Republican alike  –  believed that they ought to be allowed to buy it. Based on those figures, we estimate that making the Russian vaccine (or the Chinese) immediately available would have saved 70 or more American lives each day in the autumn of 2020 and the beginning of 2021. To put that in context, US government prohibitions on Russian and Chinese vaccines cost more lives each day than the roughly 45 people killed daily by all American murderers combined.

However, as of 4 April 2020, in comparison to attempts to containing the disease around the world, responses from Vietnam are seen as prompt and effective in protecting the interests of its citizens, with 239 confirmed cases and no fatalities. This study analyzes the situation in terms of Vietnam’s policy response, social media and science journalism. A self-made web crawl engine was used to scan and collect official media news related to COVID-19 between the beginning of January and April 4, yielding a comprehensive dataset of 14,952 news items. The findings shed light on how Vietnam—despite being under-resourced—has demonstrated political readiness to combat the emerging pandemic since the earliest days. Timely communication on any developments of the outbreak from the government and the media, combined with up-to-date research on the new virus by the Vietnamese science community, have altogether provided reliable sources of information.

qnjwg,preprints,2021-04-18,"A Scale for Measuring Social Distancing Behavior:  Survey Questions and  National Norms, USA 2020","""Social distancing"",  a set of ""nonpharmaceutical interventions"" or NPIs in the medical literature, is a primary defence, perhaps the primary defence, against infectious disease, universally advocated by medical authorities in the US and throughout the world during the current coronavirus pandemic. The idea is not new. Perhaps the first government-directed quarantine system was mid-fourteenth-century Venice's  “quaranta giorni"",  forty days of mandated isolation for incoming ships. We propose a 5-item primary scale of ""social distancing"" behavior (KEK-3) and a slightly extended variant  (KEK-3m), developed for use during the COVID-19 epidemic (and, potentially, beyond). The candidate items all had 7 answer categories. Assessment aligns very well with the classical measurement model for multi-item scales: interitem correlations are high; alpha reliability is 0.86; correlations with criterion variables are similar across the candidate items; factor analysis (oblimin rotation) finds a single dimension with an eigenvalue over 1 and loadings around .7. We provide behavioral norms for America during the 2020 pandemic and describe KEK-3's links to demographic and socioeconomic factors. Developing a replicable scale  is especially important now, because many researchers are making erroneous comparisons using the same terminology to describe aspects of the epidemic which have been measured differently. To successfully assess the ""...meaning of social change related to COVID-19, the newly emerging social practices due to lockdown measures...""

ahsxw,preprints,2020-02-18,IPCC baseline scenarios have over-projected CO2 emissions and economic growth,"Scenarios used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are central to climate science and policy. Recent studies find that observed trends and International Energy Agency (IEA) projections of global CO2 emissions have diverged from emission scenario outlooks widely employed in climate research. Here, we quantify the bases for this divergence, focusing on Kaya Identity factors: population, per-capita GDP, energy intensity (energy consumption/GDP), and carbon intensity (CO2 emissions/energy consumption). We compare 2005-2017 observations and IEA projections to 2040 of these variables, to “baseline” scenario projections from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), and from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) used in the upcoming Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We find that the historical divergence of observed CO2 emissions from baseline scenario projections can be explained largely by slower-than-projected per-capita GDP growth—predating the COVID-19 crisis. We also find carbon intensity divergence from baselines in IEA’s projections to 2040. IEA projects less coal energy expansion than the baseline scenarios, with divergence expected to continue to 2100. Future economic growth is uncertain, but we show that past divergence from observations makes it unlikely that per-capita GDP growth will catch up to baselines before mid-century. Some experts hypothesize high enough economic growth rates to allow per-capita GDP growth to catch up to or exceed baseline scenarios by 2100. However, we argue that this magnitude of catch-up may be unlikely, in light of: headwinds such as aging and debt, the likelihood of unanticipated economic crises, the fact that past economic forecasts have tended to over-project, the aftermath of the current pandemic, and economic impacts of climate change unaccounted-for in the baseline scenarios.

dm2ae,preprints,2021-04-15,Gender role attitudes cannot explain how British couples responded to increased housework demands during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Previous research has shown that gender role attitudes can predict changes in couples’ housework division over critical life events, but these studies might have suffered from endogeneity because the occurrence of such life events is anticipated and may be affected by gender role attitudes. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic was a truly exogenous shock that hit couples unexpectedly. This study examines the role of gender ideologies in how couples adjusted their division of housework during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to a pre-pandemic baseline observation. The data cover 3,219 couples from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, with a baseline wave and four COVID-19 panel waves between April and September 2020. We found no evidence that individuals’ or couples’ pre-crisis gender role attitudes affected changes in men's and women's absolute or relative contributions to housework at any time during the lockdown. However, both partners spent substantially more time on housework throughout the COVID-19 crisis than before, especially in the early stages, and in relative terms, the pandemic seems to have contributed to at least a temporary, modest increase in gender equality in housework. We discuss our results against the background of previous research whose results may have suffered from endogeneity problems and argue that the COVID-19 ‘shock’ was likely perceived as a merely temporary disruption of couples' established housework arrangements.",TRUE,2021-04-15,2021-04-15,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Corona|COVID-19|Gender ideology|Gender inequality|Gender relations|Gender role attitudes|Sociology|Understanding society,2021-04-15T09:35:03.310216,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-15,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/citation/,dm2ae,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wz86q/,wz86q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6077f510c29ca80068eb1cf2/,6077f510c29ca80068eb1cf2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dm2ae/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dm2ae/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dm2ae,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
4sjvm,preprints,2021-04-14,Changes in fertility plans during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: the role of occupation and income vulnerability,"The health and economic crisis generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented in recent human history. We investigate the role of objective and subjective indicators of economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 crisis in young Italians’ fertility plans during the year 2020. We use unique repeated cross-sectional data, collected at different time points during the pandemic (March and October/November 2020) together with pre-COVID data (2016). The data offer a standard fertility intention question pre- and during-COVID, and also a direct question on whether pre-COVID fertility plans have been confirmed, postponed or abandoned. We find that individuals with more vulnerable occupations show a lower probability of definitely intending to have a(nother) child in the short-term and a higher probability of having abandoned their pre-COVID fertility plan in March 2020, while in October 2020 changes in fertility plans did not vary by occupation. Instead, those who suffered from a negative income shock and those with negative expectations on their future income and occupation are more likely to abandon their pre-pandemic fertility plan compared to their better off counterparts, and these differences hold both in March and October. Overall, economic uncertainty generated by the pandemic seems to have similarly affected men and women’s fertility intentions.

We rely on large, nationally representative surveys conducted in July of 2020 in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, to begin to understand who shares conspiracies on social media and what motivates them.

atg8p,preprints,2021-04-08,Getting Closer by Moving Apart? Strategic Interdependence and Preferences for Debt Mutualization in the Eurozone,"Existing research suggests that a “democratic constraint” blocks progress towards debt mutualization in the eurozone: voters in creditor countries fiercely oppose debt sharing, while voters in debtor countries strongly support remaining in the euro, which limits their governments’ bargaining power. However, this literature neglects that preferences depend on expectations about what other countries will do. We document this strategic interdependence with a novel survey experiment in Germany and Italy, conducted at a crucial moment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Italian voters vastly discount the costs of a disorderly exit, while they strongly reduce their support for the euro if austerity is a condition for continued euro membership. Faced with the possibility of Italexit, German voters weigh the costs of a possible breakup of the euro more heavily than the costs of debt mutualization. A majority thus accepts debt mutualization. These results suggest that voters take strategic interdependence into account when formulating their preferences and that public opinion is not (or no longer) a binding constrain for increasing fiscal risk-sharing in the eurozone. Moreover, we reconstruct the debate about the pandemic recovery fund in Germany and Italy and show that the German change of position was aimed at defusing a threat to the integrity of the eurozone.",TRUE,2021-04-09,2021-04-09,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|debt mutualization|eurozone|public opinion|survey experiments,2021-04-09T19:30:43.664373,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-04-09,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,available,NA,https://osf.io/e5g37,prereg_both,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/citation/,atg8p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/606f66de51f7ae035cf52f5c/,606f66de51f7ae035cf52f5c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/atg8p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/atg8p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/atg8p,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The COVID-19 pandemic caused unprecedented closures of this critical resource in spring 2020. In the fall of 2020, school districts across the country reopened under varied instructional modes. Some school districts returned to in-person instruction; some operated remotely. Others reopened under hybrid models, wherein students alternated times, days, or weeks of in-person instruction. To capture this variation, we developed the Elementary School Operating Status (ESOS) database. ESOS provides data on elementary school districts’ primary operating status in the first grading period of the 2020-2021 school year, covering 25 million students in over 9,000 school districts in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. In this research note, we introduce these data and show extensive variation in school operating status at the state and school district levels. We show that school districts with greater representation of Black and Hispanic students were less likely to offer in-person instruction. We also show that fewer in-person elementary school instruction days was associated with reductions in maternal employment.

6wvg7,preprints,2021-04-06,"Calling in ""Sick"": COVID-19, Opportunism, Pretext, and Subnational Democracy","As governments sought to manage the Coronavirus pandemic, many pursed a temporary increase in centralized authority, a general tactic of crisis management. However, in some countries, centralization in the name of public health was not the only motive. The COVID-19 response coincided with broader worldwide trends towards democratic backsliding and authoritarian consolidation. Some of these efforts happened while the world was preoccupied with responding to the pandemic without concretely referencing Coronavirus; however, in other cases, public health rationales are clearly and explicitly invoked as a pretext for actions that instead aid the consolidation of regime authority. This has been especially pernicious in subnational democracy, where efforts have been made to undermine the ability of opposition parties to fairly contest in local and regional politics. This paper looks at four cases in which political actors either opportunistically used worldwide distraction from the COVID-19 pandemic or explicitly invoked public health while seeking to undermine long-term domestic contestation in their jurisdictions: Hong Kong, Hungary, Uganda, and the United States.

Recent progress has slowed, however, and the economic damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic imperils progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of eradicating extreme poverty and alleviating inequality by the year 2030. To track progress towards the SDGs, we collated—to the best of our knowledge—the largest collection of poverty and inequality related data and developed novel methods to construct comprehensive and comparable estimates of poverty and inequality from 1980 to 2019 in 204 countries and territories, across urban and rural settings, and by age; further, we forecast the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on poverty out to 2021. We find that over the past four decades, the number of individuals living in extreme poverty declined dramatically, however, extreme poverty counts were rising in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era corresponded to the fastest observed reduction in extreme poverty and a period of more equitable growth. Progress made is jeopardized by the economic shock resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The concept comes from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) report (p.18), where the curve renders the daily number of COVID-19 infections on the Y-axis and the day these are counted on X-axis of a line chart. A flatter curve visually depicts when the illness is under control, while a higher peak curve emerges when the health case system becomes overwhelmed and instances of the virus are high. Together we work to “flatten the curve” by following the recommendations of our Chief Medical Officers of Health.

This is not the only visual metaphor used to refer to COVID-19, however; the “second wave” has also been used to describe the spread of COVID-19. This term refers to another peak in the line chart that may appear as restrictions are lifted and cases spike as a result.

b9f2w,preprints,2021-03-27,Factors Influencing Asia-Pacific Countries’ Success Level in Curbing COVID-19: A Review Using a Social–Ecological System (SES) Framework,"Little attention has been paid to the impacts of institutional–human–environment dimen-
sions on the outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) abatement. Through the diagnostic
social–ecological system (SES) framework, this review paper aimed to investigate what and how
the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affected the success level of seven selected
Asia-Pacific countries (namely, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and
New Zealand) in combatting COVID-19. Drawing on statistical data from the Our World In Data web-
site, we measured the COVID-19 severity or abatement success level of the countries on the basis of
cumulative positive cases, average daily cases, and mortality rates for the period of 1 February 2020
to 30 June 2020. A qualitative content analysis using three codes, i.e., present (P), partially present
(PP), and absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as score calculation and rank ordering for govern-
ment response effectiveness and the abatement success level across the countries, was undertaken.
Not only did the standard coding process ensure data comparability but the data were deemed
substantially reliable with Cohen’s kappa of 0.76. Among 13 attributes of the SES factors, high
facility adequacy, comprehensive COVID-19 testing policies, strict lockdown measures, imposition of
penalty, and the high trust level towards the government seemed to be significant in determining
the COVID-19 severity in a country. The results show that Vietnam (ranked first) and New Zealand
(ranked second), with a high presence of attributes/design principles contributing to high-level
government stringency and health and containment indices, successfully controlled the virus, while
Indonesia (ranked seventh) and Japan (ranked sixth), associated with the low presence of design
principles, were deemed least successful. Two lessons can be drawn: (i) having high number of P for
SES attributes does not always mean a panacea for the pandemic; however, it would be detrimental
to a country if it lacked them severely, and (ii) some attributes (mostly from the governance factor)
may carry higher weightage towards explaining the success level. This comparative study providing
an overview of critical SES attributes in relation to COVID-19 offers novel policy insights, thus
helping policymakers devise more strategic, coordinated measures, particularly for effective country
preparedness and response in addressing the current and the future health crisis.",TRUE,2021-03-30,2021-03-30,2021-02-09T16:00:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Coronavirus|COVID-19|Design principles|Institutional-social-ecological system|SES framework,2021-03-30T09:48:21.066817,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-30,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/citation/,b9f2w,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605eef4d229503010d6ef76a/,605eef4d229503010d6ef76a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b9f2w/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b9f2w/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b9f2w,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
m5pnu,preprints,2021-03-26,"The `greed ́ and `nationalism ́ in vaccination against Covid-19 lead to the Tragedy of the Commons, Nash equilibrium and Giffen's goods, giving SARS-CoV-2 more opportunities to escape mutants.","It is possible to follow an ideal vaccination global strategy, that will reduce to the minimum the number of infected and dead by COVID-19 as well as the likelihood of an escape mutant. This ideal vaccination strategy needs of a high degree of international cooperation among different countries. International initiatives as COVAX, advocated by the WHO, try to achieve such goal. However, in the present scenario with limited number of vaccine doses, Game Theory model also predicts that they are becoming goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons. Countries with the capability to control vaccine dose distribution will desert from the international agreements, vaccinating first to their own nationals. If such behaviour is known by other countries (as is happening now) more countries will be tempted to desert as well. Eventually it will end in a Nash equilibrium, which stops the ideal vaccination strategy. Furthermore, in poorer countries, with great difficulties to get access to vaccine doses, these will be transformed into Giffen goods. Vaccination data available to date, show that we are in a scenario where vaccine doses have transformed into goods subject to the Tragedy of the Commons, countries desert from cooperation reaching a Nash equilibrium and vaccine doses are close to become a Giffen good for the poorer countries. This dynamic will not only rise the number of infected and dead by COVID-19, but also the likelihood of an escape mutant (in the SARS-CoV-2 populations) will be increased. If, eventually, this turns out to be the new scenario new vaccines could be developed for those new escape mutant strains, going back to a very similar setting as the starting one. Most likely, the world will reach a Pareto optimality (equilibrium between desertion and cooperation) due the pressure of those who seek high levels of cooperation to attain a global vaccination strategy.",TRUE,2021-03-29,2021-03-29,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,|COVID-19 vaccines|Giffen goods|Nash equilibrium|Tragedy of the Commons,2021-03-29T19:30:27.084792,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-29,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Javier García y García de Alcañíz|Julia Romero-López|Victoria López-Rodas y Eduardo Costas,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/citation/,m5pnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605ddf51229503009d6eb5fa/,605ddf51229503009d6eb5fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/m5pnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m5pnu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m5pnu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
uyrck,preprints,2021-03-25,"Precarious Parental Employment, Economic Hardship, and Parenting and Child Happiness Amidst Pandemic","As labor markets in recent decades have become increasingly volatile and precarious, more workers are susceptible to working conditions threatening their economic security. We examined the association between precarious parental employment, income or job loss, and parenting and child happiness during COVID-19 pandemic. We collected an online cross-sectional dataset collected in May 2020 in the United States to examine parental views on childrearing and child happiness, controlling for a rich set of sociodemographic characteristics. Our multivariate regression analysis indicate that two aspects of job precarity related to feeling vulnerable at work and receiving low material rewards from work, and losing job or income due to COVID-19 were significantly associated with a less positive view on childrearing and lower degree of child happiness reported by parents.

mvy62,preprints,2021-03-23,Baby bust in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic? First results from the new STFF data series,"Past evidence on fertility responses to external shocks, including economic recessions and the outbreaks of infectious diseases, show that people often put their childbearing plans on hold in uncertain times. We study the most recent data on monthly birth trends to analyse the initial fertility responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research, based on new Short-Term Fertility Fluctuations (STFF) data series (https://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/stff.php), embedded in the Human Fertility Database (HFD), shows the initial signs of the expected “birth recession”. Monthly number of births in many countries fell sharply between October 2020 and the most recent month observed, often bringing about a clear reversal of the previous trend. Across 17 countries with lower fluctuations in births, the number of births fell on average by 5.1% in November 2020, 6.5% in December 2020 and 8.9% in January 2021 when compared with the same month of the previous year. Spain sustained the sharpest drop in the number of births among the analysed countries, with the number of births plummeting by 20% in December 2020 and January 2021. The combined effect of rising mortality and falling birth rates is disrupting the balance of births and deaths in many countries, pushing natural population increase to record low levels in 2020 and 2021.",TRUE,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Births|COVID-19|Data|East Asia|Europe|Fertility|Highly developed countries|Human Fertility Database|Monthly data|Short-term fluctuations|Trends|United States,2021-03-24T15:10:40.957545,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.humanfertility.org/cgi-bin/stff.php,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/citation/,mvy62,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605a70c37d552b00911b22c6/,605a70c37d552b00911b22c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mvy62/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mvy62/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mvy62,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
28m6n,preprints,2021-03-23,The influence of mass media on Italian web users during COVID-19: an infodemiological analysis.,"Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has had to face a growing infodemic, which has caused severe damage to economic and health systems and has often compromised the effectiveness of infection containment regulations. Although this has spread mainly through social media, there are numerous occasions in which the mass media have shared dangerous information, giving resonance to statements without a scientific basis. For these reasons, infoveillance and infodemiology methods are increasingly exploited to monitor online information traffic. However, these tools have also been used to make epidemiological predictions. In particular, the “Google Trends” tool by GoogleTM has often been adopted by the scientific community to carry out this type of analysis. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to estimate the impact of Italian mass media on users' web searches in order to understand the role of the media in the infodemic and in the interest of Italian web users towards COVID-19. In particular, our results suggest that the Italian mass media have played a decisive role both in the spread of the infodemic and in addressing netizens' web interest, favoring the adoption of terms unsuitable for identifying the novel coronavirus (COVID- 19 disease). Therefore, we suggest greater caution and attention by the directors of news channels and newspapers and greater control of the latter by government dissemination agencies.",TRUE,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,covid-19|Google Trends|media|media influence|novel coronavirus|risk perception|sars-cov-2,2021-03-24T21:45:44.695156,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24,FALSE,NA,no,All the necessary data can be found in the paper or in the sources listed therein.,NA,no,No preregistration has been made.,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/citation/,28m6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605a3cc85717460086e634d2/,605a3cc85717460086e634d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/28m6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/28m6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/28m6n,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
vsdq4,preprints,2021-03-23,Explaining Inequalities of Homeschooling in Germany during the first COVID-19 Lockdown,"Current studies suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening existing social inequalities in the field of education worldwide. We argue that the pandemic is especially challenging for students from socially disadvantaged and educationally deprived homes as parental engagement and resources are hugely important to guide and support the learning process during the school closure period.
To examine how well parents were able to help their children with schoolwork during the homeschooling period in Germany, we used data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) collected during the first homeschooling period in May/June 2020. Taking known mechanisms of inequality of educational opportunity into account, we explore the effects of parents’ aspirations and cultural, social, and economic capital on the ability to help their children.
Our results show that although the majority of parents were able to provide good support with schoolwork, we found the expected inequalities due to social background. Low educated parents are twice as likely to be unable to provide sufficient support compared to highly educated parents. In our multivariate analyses, family resources show a significant positive effect on the likelihood that parents were able to help.
Moreover, regardless of the social or cultural capital endowment of the parents, good technical equipment in the household is associated with a higher probability of support. Thus, ensuring technical home equipment could be a way to promote an educationally supportive learning environment across all social groups.",TRUE,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|educational inequality|Germany|homeschooling|learning environment|social background,2021-03-24T15:12:15.641727,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://dx.doi.org/10.5157/NEPS:SC2:9.0.0|https://www.neps-data.de,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d50|Education|Secondary Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/citation/,vsdq4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6059dc67818bde00663af7ea/,6059dc67818bde00663af7ea,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vsdq4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vsdq4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vsdq4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
ey36d,preprints,2021-03-23,"Measuring the direct population impact of COVID-19 in Scotland, 2020: estimating disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) during the first full calendar year","Background: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) combine the impact of morbidity and mortality and can enable comprehensive, and comparable, assessments of direct and indirect health harms due to COVID-19. Our aim was to estimate DALYs directly due to COVID-19 in Scotland, during 2020; and contextualise its population impact relative to other causes of disease and injury.

Methods: National deaths and daily case data were used. Deaths were based on underlying and contributory causes recorded on death certificates. We calculated DALYs based on the COVID-19 consensus model and methods outlined by the European Burden of Disease Network. DALYs were presented as a range, using a sensitivity based on Years of Life Lost estimates using: cause-specific; and COVID-19 related deaths. All estimates were for 2020.

Findings: In 2020, estimates of COVID-19 DALYs in Scotland ranged from 96,500 to 108,200. Direct COVID-19 DALYs were substantial enough to be framed as the second leading cause of disease and injury, with only ischaemic heart disease having a larger impact on population health. Mortality contributed 98% of total DALYs.

Interpretation: The direct population health impact of COVID-19 has been very substantial. Despite unprecedented mitigation efforts, COVID-19 developed from a single identified case in early 2020 to a condition with an impact in Scotland second only to ischaemic heart disease. Periodic estimation of DALYs during 2021, and beyond, will provide indications of the impact of DALYs averted due to the national roll-out of the vaccination programme and other continued mitigation efforts, although new variants may pose significant challenges.",TRUE,2021-03-24,2021-03-24,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,burden of disease|coronavirus|COVID-19|DALY|disability-adjusted life year|European Burden of Disease Network|population health|Scottish Burden of Disease|YLD|YLL,2021-03-24T21:48:24.841202,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-24,FALSE,NA,no,"Summary data from the datasets supporting the conclusions of this article that were used to estimate COVID-19 morbidity in Scotland are available online in the Supplementary Material section.

Methods: We included studies conducted in any population, describing either the impact of the closure or reopening of hospitality venues, or exposure to these venues, on the incidence or mortality from COVID-19. We used a snowball sampling approach with backward and forward citation search along with co-citations. 
Results: We found 20 articles examining the role of hospitality venues in the epidemiology of COVID-19. Modeling studies showed that interventions reducing social contacts in indoor venues can reduce COVID-19 transmission. Studies using statistical models showed similar results, including that the closure of hospitality venues is amongst the most effective measures in reducing incidence or mortality. Case studies highlighted the role of hospitality venues in generating super-spreading events, along with the importance of air flow and ventilation inside these venues.

tv8zw,preprints,2021-03-18,“I’m Not Gonna Put That On My Kids”: Gendered Opposition to New Public Health Initiatives,"Our individualistic, consumeristic medical system pushes women to act as family health managers. As a result, women are generally more likely than men to follow expert medical recommendations for avoiding health risks. In the context of rampant misinformation, however, the pressure women face to control risks may lead them to disproportionately oppose some new efforts to promote public health. We investigate this possibility using a novel mixed-methods study examining gendered opposition to two school-based public health initiatives related to COVID-19. Nationally representative surveys of 1,946 parents reveal that mothers are significantly more likely than other parents to oppose school-required immunizations against COVID-19 and significantly more likely to report planning not to vaccinate their children. This opposition is particularly pronounced among white Republican/Republican-leaning mothers (54% opposed). Simultaneously, however, mothers are significantly less likely than other parents to oppose school mask mandates, with white Democrat/Democrat-leaning fathers being most opposed (45%). In-depth interviews with a socioeconomically, politically, and racially/ethnically diverse group of mothers (N=64) link these patterns to mothers’ beliefs that they can control the risks of COVID-19 (including through use of masks) but not the risks of COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, we conclude that, in the context of rampant misinformation, gendered pressures lead mothers to disproportionately support initiatives they perceive as useful for controlling health risks and disproportionately oppose initiatives they perceive as introducing uncontrollable risks. Given high rates of parental opposition to COVID-related public health initiatives, we suggest that a consumeristic model of medicine, coupled with widespread misinformation, may lead to a crisis of confidence that undermines public health.",TRUE,2021-04-03,2021-03-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,children|COVID-19|gender|health|immunizations|masks|misinformation|motherhood|politics|schools|vaccines,2021-03-18T20:23:03.103457,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18,FALSE,NA,no,Data used in the quantitative portion of this analysis are available from the authors upon request.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/citation/,tv8zw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6053a27cc402cc00ae975a19/,6053a27cc402cc00ae975a19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tv8zw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tv8zw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tv8zw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

En segundo lugar, la entidad federativa en donde el impacto fue mayor fue la Ciudad de México, lo que provocó una reducción en la desigualdad entre estados.

tzma5,preprints,2021-03-18,Is the Recession a ‘Shecession’? Gender Inequality in the Employment Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany,"This paper evaluates gender inequality in employment risks during the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. We use individual-level panel data collected weekly between 20 March and 9 July 2020, and again in January 2021, to examine the risks of short-time work, job loss and unpaid furlough, as well as having to work on-site by means of growth curve modelling. The results reveal gender inequality in employment risks and gendered use of governmental support schemes. During the early phase of the pandemic, women had a higher probability of being temporarily exempted from work, but a lower probability of being in short-time work and receiving the associated state benefits. Compared to men, women also continuously had a higher probability of working on-site rather that from home. Consequently, women’s employment during the pandemic is more polarized between job loss or working on-site with the associated infection risk. Gender inequalities are rooted in the long-term gendered dualization of the German labour market with the low-wage sector and marginal employment being female dominated. The results call for close monitoring of long-term gendered effects of the pandemic recession and an adjustment of governmental crisis measures to the requirements of the female workforce.",TRUE,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,Corona crisis|Furlough|Growth Curve Modelling|; Lockdown|Short-time work|Unemployment,2021-03-18T14:52:01.307994,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18,FALSE,NA,no,data is available after signing a data sharing agreement,NA,no,no preregistration,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/citation/,tzma5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/605365c0c402cc0081977d30/,605365c0c402cc0081977d30,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tzma5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tzma5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tzma5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
82cyw,preprints,2021-03-18,Viral Solidarity? EU Solidarity and Risk-Sharing in the COVID-19 Crisis,"Fiscal integration has long been regarded as a necessary condition to ensure the long-term stability of the euro. In the aftermath of the euro crisis, concerns about a populist backlash of Eurosceptic voters constrained national governments in their ability to pursue such integration. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, national leaders were able to agree to the Next Generation EU, a pandemic recovery fund of over 750 billion euro establishing an unprecedented, far-reaching, albeit temporary, fiscal stabilization capacity. Still, we know very little about citizens’ preferences towards the pandemic recovery fund? To answer this question, we conducted an original survey experiment on public support for different designs of a European pandemic recovery fund. We fielded the survey in five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain) in July 2020, at the time that national leaders agreed on the recovery fund. Our results show that there is surprisingly high support for a joint European fiscal instrument and that citizens react to different elements of the pandemic recovery fund. They prefer a broad program that is directed at countries in need, but they are skeptical about common debt. Yet, citizens’ skepticism towards common debt is not important enough for them to negatively evaluate the program as a whole. Overall, the pandemic recovery fund agreed under ‘Next Generation EU’ is a well-tailored instrument to generate widespread political support across European member states.",TRUE,2021-03-18,2021-03-18,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,conjoint experiment|European Union|fiscal integration|pandemic recovery fund|public opinion|risk-sharing|solidarity,2021-03-18T14:34:28.304987,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-18,FALSE,NA,no,The study relies on a novel survey that was conducted by the authors.

qwxz3,preprints,2021-03-17,Baby Bust: Falling Fertility in US Counties Is Associated with COVID-19 Prevalence and Mobility Reductions,"The United States experienced a 3.8 percent decline in births for 2020 compared with 2019, but the rate of decline was much faster at the end of the year (8 percent in December), suggesting dramatic early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began affecting social life in late March 2020. Using birth data from Florida and Ohio counties through February 2021, this analysis examines whether and how much falling birth rates were associated with local pandemic conditions, specifically infection rates and reductions in geographic mobility. Results show that the vast majority of counties experienced declining births, suggestive of a general influence of the pandemic, but also that declines were steeper in places with greater prevalence of COVID-19 infections and more extensive reductions in mobility. The latter result is consistent with more direct influences of the pandemic on family planning or sexual behavior.

7uvt3,preprints,2021-03-17,Impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown on scientific productivity and workload in Denmark: a gender analysis,"The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown of Universities globally in the spring of 2020 appears to have had a negative impact on female academics in countries studied to date. Denmark is an exemplar country with clear legislative practices to support gender quality, and differences between men and women with regards to unpaid house and care work are less substantial than many other places. It is largely unknown whether Danish academics experienced the same level of COVID-19-related disruption to productivity and whether women, or academics with children in general experienced more serious disruption.  To investigate the local effects of the lockdown in Danish academia, we (i) performed an analysis of preprints in a single academic field and (ii) surveyed academics employed at Denmark’s largest University.  We found that parents with young children worked less hours per day during the lockdown than academics with older or no children and that this effect was more pronounced in women with young children. The vast majority of both male and female scholars with teaching responsibility reported more time spent on teaching. A larger proportion of junior academics felt their productivity decreased compared to senior academics. Additionally, analyses of the number self-reported submitted grants and manuscripts did not show any differences differ by gender or career level. However, the gender gap did increase during the first month of the lockdown with respect to the number of manuscripts submitted to preprint servers. This study contributes to emerging data on the impact of lockdowns on academic productivity and highlights the negative impact on parents with young children that is exacerbated in women with young children.",TRUE,2021-03-17,2021-03-17,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2021-03-17T16:52:40.862965,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-17,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.synapse.org/biorxivofdanishresearchers,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/citation/,7uvt3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60522ca2c402cc000e976821/,60522ca2c402cc000e976821,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7uvt3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7uvt3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7uvt3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results from OLS regression models show that following the pandemic outbreak, among women who worked full-time, mothers reported smaller stress increases than non-mothers. Among part-time and non-employed women, mothers and non-mothers experienced similar levels of stress increase. Changes in women’s work hours and employment status, following the pandemic onset, had limited impacts on the patterns of stress level changes.

fdgky,preprints,2021-03-13,Urban food markets and the COVID-19 lockdown in India,"On March 24, 2020, the Government of India announced a 21-day national lockdown that has since been extended to May 31, 2020. The lockdown left urban food markets in disarray with severe supply bottlenecks and restrictions on doing business. At a time when food prices in India were declining consistently, supply disruptions consequent to the lockdown have reversed the trend on average. Based on an analysis of publicly available data on wholesale and retail prices for 22 commodities from 114 Centers, we find that prices have increased since the lockdown, as of August 1, 2020. There is significant diversity across commodities and geographies that mask aggregate figures. Average price increases were to the tune of over 6% for several pulses, over 3.5% for most edible oils, 15% for potato 28% for tomato in the four weeks post-lockdown compared to prices during the four weeks preceding the lockdown. Price of meat and fish too have registered large increases. Price wedge between retail and wholesale prices increased as did spatial dispersion, both signifying friction in supply chains. We find that smaller cities have seen a much higher increase in prices with some seeing a rise in retail food prices by as much as 20%. Three rounds of surveys, conducted between April and July, of food retailers in 14 Indian cities reveal serious operational challenges. These include, among others, transport and labor shortages, police harassment and social discrimination. At the same time, several innovative arrangements and adaptations have evolved as well suggesting resilience. The paper reviews these aspects and outlines some lessons for food policy in emerging economies.",TRUE,2021-03-14,2021-03-14,2020-09-01T18:30:00,NA,TRUE,FALSE,agrifood supply chain|COVID-19|India|lockdown|prices|retail|urban food system|wholesale,2021-03-14T22:37:21.916763,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-14,FALSE,NA,no,Available from the first author,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Sudha Narayanan; Shee Saha,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/citation/,fdgky,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/604cf200b57c9c0150805f8b/,604cf200b57c9c0150805f8b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fdgky/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fdgky/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fdgky,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
emrtj,preprints,2021-03-13,Political and Socioeconomic Influences on Social Distancing Behaviour in the United States,"The Social Distancing Index (SDI) measures social distancing behaviour every day across all fifty American states. This study leverages SDI data to model social distancing behaviour with time-series COVID-19 data, as well as an array of political and economic variables. The central aim of this study is to examine three hypotheses: (i) COVID-19 outbreaks within a state will induce social distancing by fear of the virus, (ii) states with more low-income workers will engage in less social distancing due to the nature of essential work, and (iii) political beliefs will influence social distancing behaviour, through the public debate over social distancing policy and a partisan logic defining state stay-at-home orders. We use Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Beta Regression models to determine the most influential variables in this study. VAR models for time-series relationships between cases and social distancing behaviour in California and Texas, and corresponding Granger-Cause Test results, are investigated through case studies. Significant Beta model variables influencing social distancing behaviour are closely examined through visual data analysis and qualitatively contextualized to describe relationships present in the data.

t4wqs,preprints,2021-03-12,Exploring experiences and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young racially minoritised people in the United Kingdom: A Qualitative Study,"Within high-income-countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted people from racially minoritised backgrounds. There has been significant research interrogating the disparate impact of the virus, and recently, interest in the long-term implications of the global crisis on young people’s mental health and wellbeing. However, less work explores the experiences of young people from racialised backgrounds as they navigate the pandemic, and the specific consequences this has for their mental health.  Forty young people (age 16-25) from black, mixed and other minority backgrounds and living in London, participated in consecutive focus group discussions over a two-month period, to explore the impact of the pandemic on their lives and emotional wellbeing. Thematic analysis identified seven categories describing the impact of the pandemic, indicating: deepening of existing socioeconomic and emotional challenges; efforts to navigate racism and difference within the response; and survival strategies drawing on communal and individual resources. Young people also articulated visions for a future public health response which addressed gaps in current strategies. Findings point to the need to contextualize public health responses to the pandemic in line with the lived experiences of racialised young people.

cmkaw,preprints,2021-03-12,"Changes in public response associated with various COVID-19 restrictions in Ontario, Canada: an observational study using social media time series data","Background: News media coverage of anti-mask protests, COVID-19 conspiracies, and pandemic politicization has overemphasized extreme views, but does little to represent views of the general public. Investigating the public’s response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policymakers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions. 

Objective: Using data from social media, this study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g. business and school closure, regional lockdown differences, additional public health restrictions such as social distancing and masking). 

Methods: COVID-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 to Oct 31 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites, and dynamic regression models with ARIMA errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (i.e. collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement) controlling for the effects of confounders (i.e. daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, COVID-related official updates). 

Results: In addition to expected direct effects (e.g. business closure led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restriction on public opinion is contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts.  While school closure and other restrictions (e.g. masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (i.e. sentiment polarization). Partial (region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (i.e. higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns. 

Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data.

In most cases, however, media outlets treated this phenomenon with little explanatory depth.

dr3ws,preprints,2021-03-08,Education Resilience in the Time of COVID-19,"Due to the world pandemic, COVID-19, higher education institutions (HEIs) have found themselves in an unprecedented situation. Like no other time before, this pandemic has posed a serious test of resilience of HEIs – hence, the current study sets off to seize this opportunity to study the resilience of Omani HEIs. HEIs in Oman have devised contingency plans in light of the directives and declarations received from the government Supreme Committee responsible for handling the impact of COVID-19. The study aimed at examining the directives received by Omani HEIs against the framework of the securitization theory in order to identify the substances of the basis on which HEIs built their teaching and learning plans. The study was also planned to closely investigate the individual experiences of various stakeholders directly involved in the implementation of the contingency of the teaching and learning plans. Data were collected using document analysis and analysis of reflective texts. Discourse content analysis was applied in order to understand the lived experiences of stakeholders and to identify what shaped their experiences. The discourse of the collected data was analysed using the approach of thematic analysis which helped to identify recurrent patterns concerning the teaching and learning plans of some Omani HEIs during COVID-19.  A number of challenges along with the challenges of other HEIs worldwide were identified, such as uncertainty and lack of resources and experience in online teaching and learning. The discussion of the findings in this study revealed dichotomies, as well as agreement, in the way stakeholders perceive aspects of the contingency plans of teaching, learning and assessment. On the basis of this finding, the study calls for a more nuanced approach to strengthen the resilience of higher education. Particularly, the study recommends incorporating processes of normalization of teaching and learning as well as of assessment in HEIs delivery modes as a way to consolidate HEIs’ resilience.",TRUE,2021-03-08,2021-03-08,NA,10.24093/awej/MEC2.20,TRUE,FALSE,educational resilience|face-to-face education|face-to-face securitization theory|normalization|online teaching and learning,2021-03-08T13:57:41.092641,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-08,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/citation/,dr3ws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6045952751a4a600ce7724dd/,6045952751a4a600ce7724dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dr3ws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dr3ws/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dr3ws,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/MEC2.20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the educational institutions here have responded swiftly to fulfill the requirements of academia by switching to an online emergency remote teaching mode overnight. To get adjusted to the ‘new normal,’ teachers across all academic disciplines, including the English language, have had to adapt to new teaching approaches and learn new skills and competencies to confront this challenge. This empirical cross-sectional research study explores the teacher technology self-efficacy, the challenges faced, and the innovative practices adopted by the EFL teachers during the crisis. A mixed-methods approach was used here, including an online survey and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with six teachers. The survey was administered to 100 EFL teachers from fourteen higher-education institutions, whereas the interviews were held with six survey participants. The study found that majority of the teachers had a strong sense of self-efficacy in using technology as well as considerably positive learning experiences and novel innovations, which all resulted in the various ways they faced pandemic-related challenges. The paper gives, in particular, an account of the innovative techniques adopted by the interviewed teachers during the Pandemic crisis.

fcqd9,preprints,2021-03-05,The Impact of COVID-19 on Fertility behaviour and Intentions in the Republic of Moldova,"The COVID Pandemic could affect fertility behaviour and intentions in many ways. Restrictions on service provision may reduce access to family planning services and increase fertility in the short term. By contrast, the economic uncertainty brought about by the pandemic and its impact on mental health and well-being may reduce fertility. These various pathways have been explored in the context of high income countries such as the United States and Western Europe, but little is known about middle income countries. In this paper we asses the impact of the COVID pandemic on fertility intentions and behaviour in the Republic of Moldova, a middle income country in Eastern Europe, using the Generations and Gender Survey. This survey was conducted partially before and partially after the pandemic, allowing for detailed analysis of individual circumstances. The results indicate that the pandemic reduced contraceptive use by 40%. Conversely couples were also 41% less likely to be trying to conceive after the onset of the pandemic, although medium term fertility intentions were unchanged. Indicators therefore suggest that in the medium term fertility intentions may not be affected by the pandemic but access to family planning services and deferring attempts to conceive may change which individuals have children and when.",TRUE,2021-03-12,2021-03-05,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Fertility|Fertility Intentions|GGP|Moldova|Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health,2021-03-05T14:11:01.492215,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-03-05,FALSE,NA,no,Data available upon registration at www.ggp-i.org,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/citation/,fcqd9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6042115a67386c047161aa6f/,6042115a67386c047161aa6f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcqd9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcqd9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcqd9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet even when voters agree on the facts, they tend to attribute responsibility in a group-serving manner, disproportionately crediting their party for positive developments and blaming opponents for negative developments. Using original time series data, we show that partisan disagreement over U.S. President Donald Trump's responsibility for the COVID-19 pandemic quickly emerged alongside the pandemic's onset in March 2020. Three original survey experiments show that the valence of information about the country's performance against the virus contributes causally to such gaps.

cah76,preprints,2021-03-02,"Information exposure, perceptions and behaviours during the first COVID-19 wave in Germany: Evidence from survey and Facebook data","The role of information exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic seems ambiguous, as gains in knowledge from public information campaigns stand against fears of widespread misinformation, especially via social media. Using data from a large survey collected during the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020 as well as data from Facebook, this paper investigates from which sources (e.g., public or commercial broadcasting, newspapers or Facebook) Germans received news and how information exposure relates to perceptions, attitudes and behaviours concerning COVID-19. Regression analyses based on the survey data show that getting COVID-19-related information from a multitude of sources strongly predicted positive public health outcomes and that no individual source had negative effects. A quantitative text analysis of almost a million German public Facebook posts indicates that the positive individual-level effects might be related to a uniform coverage of COVID-19 that emphasised the severity of the pandemic, whereas misinformation seemed to be less widespread than feared. The results suggest that fears of an `infodemic' may be overstated and that the high salience of COVID-19 in media coverage helped the efforts to mitigate the pandemic.

rs4qz,preprints,2021-02-26,Neighborhood Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted Americans’ daily lives by changing how and when they move. These changes could alter inequalities in mobility and therefore contribute to many forms of social stratification. Relying on SafeGraph cellphone movement data in 2019-2020 we focus on the 25 largest cities in the U.S. and measure inequality in mobility between census tracts by using two indexes proposed by Phillips and colleagues (2019). These measures capture the importance of hubs in a mobility network (Concentrated Mobility Index) and neighborhood isolation (Equitable Mobility Index). We find that the pandemic affected mobility inequality in all 25 cities. In the earliest phases of the pandemic, neighborhood isolation rapidly increased, and the importance of downtown central business districts declined. Mobility hubs generally regained their importance, whereas neighborhood isolation remained elevated started and to increased again during the latter half of 2020. Furthermore, we estimate linear regression models with city and week fixed effects predicting changes in neighborhood isolation relative to 2019 baseline. We find that larger numbers of new COVID-19 cases are positively and statistically significantly associated with changes in neighborhood isolation a week later. Additionally, we find that places with larger populations, more public transportation use, and greater racial and ethnic segregation all had larger increases in neighborhood isolation during 2020.

9d5j4,preprints,2021-02-25,Findings from an online survey on the mental health effects of COVID-19 on Canadians with disabilities and chronic health conditions,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to worsening mental health outcomes throughout the Canadian population, its effects have been more acute among already marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This paper examines how heightened fears of contracting the virus, financial impacts, and social isolation contribute to declining mental health among this already vulnerable group. This paper investigates how increases in anxiety, stress, and despair are associated with concerns about getting infected, COVID-19-induced financial hardship, and increased social isolation as a result of adhering to protective measures among people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. This study uses original national quota-based online survey data (n=1,027) collected in June 2020 from people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Three logistic regression models investigate the relationship between COVID-19's effects on finances, concerns about contracting the virus, changes in loneliness and belonging, and measures taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 and reports of increased anxiety, stress, and despair, net of covariates. Models show that increased anxiety, stress, and despair were associated with negative financial effects of COVID-19, greater concerns about contracting COVID-19, increased loneliness, and decreased feelings of belonging. Net of other covariates, increased measures taken to combat COVID-19 was not significantly associated with mental health outcomes.

tfyj5,preprints,2021-02-18,COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on online sex advertising and sex trafficking,"Disruptive social events like the Covid-19 pandemic can have significant impact on the commercial sex industry, yet these effects have been little understood. This paper examines the effect of the pandemic on one part of the commercial sex industry: sex trafficking. Our results from scraped sexual service advertisements show that the pandemic has had measurable impact on online advertising for sex trafficking in the United States, with a significant decrease associated with stay-at-home orders followed by an increase to levels well above prepandemic levels as Covid-related restrictions were relaxed. We contribute to the policy landscape by showing that the initial decrease was associated with a loss of demand for sexual services due to pandemic-related health concerns, but that a confluence of factors, including the lack of economic and social support, increased the number of people vulnerable to being exploited. This study can assist policy makers in predicting future changes in the sex industry to support a more just and inclusive society. In the context of future health crises, natural disasters, and major social disruptions it can guide policy makers in apportioning public aid in a way that does not leave vulnerable populations and existing sex workers powerless to being trafficked.",TRUE,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,NA,2021-02-19T08:56:52.916801,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19,FALSE,NA,no,Data can be made available through discussion with the authors.

dn43c,preprints,2021-02-18,"‘Stressed, uncomfortable, vulnerable, neglected’: a qualitative study of the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK frontline keyworkers.","Aims: Non-healthcare keyworkers face distinct occupational vulnerabilities that have received little consideration within broader debates about ‘essential’ work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and wellbeing of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK.

Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services and the police force. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. 

Results: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. 

Conclusion: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (e.g. seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.",TRUE,2021-03-05,2021-02-19,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|frontline services|keyworkers|psychological wellbeing|qualitative,2021-02-19T08:54:03.195316,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/citation/,dn43c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e85f64ad52e00ea6e91ee/,602e85f64ad52e00ea6e91ee,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dn43c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dn43c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dn43c,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
2a9qc,preprints,2021-02-18,Perceptions of Canadian Federal Policy Responses to COVID-19 among People with Disabilities and Chronic Health Conditions,"This study examines how people with disabilities and chronic health conditions—members of a large and diverse group often overlooked by Canadian public policy—are making sense of the Canadian federal government's response to COVID-19. Using original national online survey data collected in June 2020 (N=1,027), we investigate how members of this group view the government's overall response. Although survey results show broad support for the federal government's pandemic response, findings also indicate fractures based on disability type and specific health condition, political partisanship, region, and experiences with COVID-19. Among these, identification with the Liberal party and receipt of CERB stand out as associated with more positive views. Further examination of qualitative responses shows that these views are also linked to differing perspectives surrounding government benefits and spending, partisan divisions, as well as other social and cultural cleavages.",TRUE,2021-02-19,2021-02-19,2021-02-08T05:00:00,10.3138/cpp.2021-012,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|disability|employment|federal government|federalism|finances|health|political partisanship|public opinion|public policy|welfare state,2021-02-19T08:53:24.879728,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-19,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,available,NA,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jE-NSjEkYbeK0o3sukU9YlPLx_vvWMXm/view,prereg_both,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|School Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Leadership Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Affairs|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e41|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Disability and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",David Pettinicchio,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/citation/,2a9qc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602e6cee34d30400d9e3a0ba/,602e6cee34d30400d9e3a0ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2a9qc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2a9qc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2a9qc,https://doi.org/10.3138/cpp.2021-012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
rsa7t,preprints,2021-02-17,E–Mentoring female underrepresented public health student researchers: Supporting a more diverse post–pandemic workforce,"Within higher education, underrepresented students continue to face inequalities and discrimination to this day,1 with unique challenges emphasized during the COVID–19 pandemic. Mentoring, whether through formal or informal counseling or coaching, is one way to offer assistance to such students.2 Mentors can provide critical support as students contemplate and pursue completion of higher degrees and pursue occupations that directly serve their communities. During COVID–19 lockdowns, as classes and work became remote, mentoring also transitioned online to electronic mentoring or e–mentoring. E–mentoring was implemented formally by some universities,3 and informally by independent researchers. One female independent researcher of color had a research team consisting of 7 female colleagues in 6 countries and 7 female student researchers (she mentored 2 in–person, e–mentored 5). Since all the students represented different racial and ethnic backgrounds, they offer this unique collection of e–mentoring case studies during the pandemic. The lead author mentored all 7 student authors of this paper. The senior author, also a female independent researcher of color shared her e–mentoring experiences.

84zq5,preprints,2021-02-16,Fifty Muslim-majority countries have fewer COVID-19 cases and deaths than the 50 richest non-Muslim countries,"Objective
To determine the difference in the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths between Muslim-majority and non-Muslim countries, and investigate reasons for the disparities. All Muslim-majority countries are considered partly or completely not free (in war), and 80% are LMICs (low- and middle-income countries). 
Methods
The 50 Muslim-majority countries have more than 50.0% Muslims with an average of 87.5% Muslims. The non-Muslim country sample consisted of 50 countries with highest GDP while omitting any Muslim-majority countries listed. Their average percentage of Muslims was 4.7%. All data was pulled on September 18, 2020. To measure incidence of COVID-19, three different Average Treatment Methods (ATE) were used to validate the results. 
Results
Non-Muslim countries had significantly more COVID-19 cases, 3-times that of Muslim-majority countries. Non-Muslim countries had 1.86-times more COVID-19 deaths than Muslim-majority countries. These percentages were obtained by applying the simulation method to ATE’s results.
Conclusion
Despite most Muslim-majority countries being poor and all considered partly or completely unfree, 34/50 (68%) countries had shown a decline in active COVID-19 cases. This study shows that Muslims’ practice of tahara (purity or cleanliness) is similar to many COVID-19 containment measures and tawakkul (trust in Allah) helps them remain resilient and hopeful during difficult unpredictable times, such as living through a pandemic. Developed countries can benefit from the knowledge learned in this study.

2rvsm,preprints,2021-02-14,Corpus-based Comparative Study of Online News Reporting of the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Philippines and Malaysia,"When faced with new and threatening events like a global health crisis, the public tends to draw inferences from news media to make sense of the uncertainties of the situation. This study explores how online news media in the Philippines and Malaysia depicted the outbreak of COVID-19 during the early period of its spread. The study analyzes the discourse around the outbreak based on a large corpus of Facebook news posts between January and March 2020. Using a corpus-based approach called Keyness Analysis, salient themes &amp; topics, and framings around the disease were identified and interpreted. The results show the differences in the reporting of the outbreak between the two countries. News reports in the Philippines depicted the disease in an enigmatic lens which explains the alarmist angle of news reports and the reassuring tone of the government, versus the war framing of Malaysian news that depicted the disease as an enemy to be fought and defeated. In reporting about the bid to contain the spread of the virus, Philippine news reports dealt mostly with the restrictions and regulations of movement while the Malaysian news covered more issues on personal hygiene and safety protocols. Lastly, concerns for Filipino seafarers and Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) that needs to be repatriated was a recurring theme in Philippine news reports regarding COVID-19, while concerns for the economy was prominent in the Malaysian news reports. The study therefore shows that the depiction of COVID-19 in Malaysia and the Philippines are shaped by each country’s present social and political conditions.",TRUE,2021-02-15,2021-02-15,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,corpus-based study|corpus linguistics|COVID-19|keyness analysis|news representation|online news|pandemic in news|Philippine media|Philippines,2021-02-15T19:27:01.583957,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-15,FALSE,NA,no,A corpus of online news reports published by Philippine and Malaysian news media companies are used as data for this study.

h64fr,preprints,2021-02-13,"New York City Jails: COVID Discharge Policy, Data Transparency, and Reform","During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the release of New York City jail inmates who were at high risk of contracting the disease and at low risk of committing criminal reoffense. Using public information, we construct and analyze a database of nearly 350,000 incarceration episodes in the city jail system from 2014 - 2020. In concordance with de Blasio's stated policy, inmates discharged immediately after his order were at a lower risk of reoffense than inmates discharged during the same calendar week in previous years. The inmates in the former group were also slightly older, on average, than those in the latter group, although the overall age distributions of the two groups were quite similar. Additionally, the inmates of the former group had spent dramatically longer in jail than those in the latter group. With the release of long-serving inmates demonstrated to be feasible, we also examine how the jail population would have looked over the past six years had caps in incarceration been in place. With a cap of one year, the system would experience a 15% decrease in incarceration. With a cap of 100 days, incarceration would be just under 50% of the realized value. Because our results are only as accurate as New York City's public-facing jail data, we discuss numerous challenges with this data and suggest improvements. These improvements would address issues including inmate age, gender, and race. Finally, we discuss policy implications of our work, highlight some opportunities and challenges posed by incarceration caps, and suggest key areas for reform. It is striking that the de Blasio administration was able to identify inmates at low risk of reoffense and was willing to release them. Their success with discharge during the early stages of COVID-19 suggests that low-risk inmates could be discharged sooner in general.",TRUE,2021-02-16,2021-02-16,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,bail|coronavirus|COVID-19|diversity|equity|ethnicity|gender|incarceration|inclusion|inmate|jail|New York City|NYC|public health|race|reform,2021-02-16T06:12:02.563889,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-16,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://bit.ly/qside-nyc-jail-data,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0d|Law|Criminal Procedure|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology",Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion|Diversity|and Equity|Inc.|501(c)3,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/citation/,h64fr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60283c0973c9fe02a3076318/,60283c0973c9fe02a3076318,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h64fr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h64fr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h64fr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
ysm35,preprints,2021-02-10,Developing initial programme theory: COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium Hospital-Onset COVID-19 study (COG-UK HOCI),"Intervention programme theory enhances the development, evaluation, optimisation and translation of complex interventions. It clearly specifies the ways intervention context and content combine to produce intervention outcomes. We report the development of initial programme theory for a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence-report tool (SRT). The SRT translates genome sequencing data to drive changes in the intensity and location of infection prevention and control (IPC) and related cleaning activities within UK NHS hospitals to reduce nosocomial infections. The SRT is being trialled within the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium Hospital-Onset COVID-19 study (HOCI). Within the HOCI study, we will assess the impact of the SRT, and its timing, when compared to no sequence data, on the occurrence and transmission location of nosocomial infection, reducing its incidence rate and identifying previously undetected nosocomial transmission. To develop the initial programme theory we used documentary analysis (e.g. trial protocol, case report forms, drafts of the SRT), informal discussions with trial team members, and the iterative development of logic models. The intervention’s causal mechanisms were conceptualised using combined insights from behavioural, implementation science and complex adaptive systems perspectives. Our initial programme theory will subsequently be used to shape a process evaluation within a diverse sample of trial sites. The planned process evaluation will use the initial programme theory and assess SRT acceptability, support for its putative causal mechanisms, issues of fidelity and adaptation, and examine how the planned intervention has worked, or not, in relation to intended and unintended consequences.",TRUE,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COG-UK|Complex interventions|COVID-19|Genome sequencing|Infection prevention and control|Nosocomial infection|Process evaluation|Programme theory|SARS-CoV-2,2021-02-10T18:20:01.393136,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10,FALSE,NA,no,We analysed study documents not in the public domain and supplemented data analysis through attendance at study meetings and informal conversations with trial team members,NA,no,Not applicable for this study,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/citation/,ysm35,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/602407fe23238300ed9dde14/,602407fe23238300ed9dde14,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ysm35/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ysm35/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ysm35,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
f9tsw,preprints,2021-02-08,Mitigating losses: How science diplomacy can address the impact of COVID-19 on early career researchers,"Despite the failures to tackle early coordinated responses at national and multinational levels, the global emergence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic promoted unprecedented actions on the science-policy, science-communication, and science-diplomacy interfaces worldwide. With varying degrees of success, various actions within the realm of science diplomacy have accompanied the creation of knowledge related to COVID-19 through international collaboration. The COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill and also drew attention to the genuine need for science diplomacy. This pandemic highlighted the need of training opportunities in the interface of policy and diplomacy for researchers to be able to get grips on emerging health issues. Moreover, it is necessary to create specific platforms for experts to interact with decision-makers at the national and international levels, especially in the Global South. This crisis inevitably shifted the focus on scientific areas that directly address the pandemic response (epidemiology, public health, virology, immunology, pharmacology, human behavioral research, economics, among others). At the same time, some areas not related to the pandemic response have been slowed down due to inevitable physical and social restrictions that impacted certain aspects of the academic life. This does not only relate to daily access to the lab, scientific collections, or field sites, but also associates with furloughed employees and reduced funding to non-COVID-19-related research. Moreover, during the pandemic, women and (usually young) scientists with children have reduced their research efforts substantially, with future implications still difficult to quantify. While some researchers might have harnessed telecommuting and lockdown periods to focus on data analysis and publication writing, gender bias still exists. The slight increase in publications with pre-acquired data may still be followed by an immediate future impacted by the lack of data acquisition during the pandemic. These issues may create long-term effects due to reduced capacity for generating pre-requisite data for securing new funding, termination of research, reduced networking opportunities, restrictions to international collaborations, collectively having a negative impact on other disciplines. While most established researchers may not be affected hardly by the above-mentioned effects, early career researchers (ECRs), represent a more vulnerable population. ECRs usually refer to PhD students, postdoctoral fellows and scientists who have 10 years or less of experience after the doctoral degree, although there is some flexibility in this definition. Due to their career stage, ECRs often face job precarity, lack of available opportunities, low funding, and job insecurity (e.g., untenured positions and temporary contract employees). These problems are augmented by the COVID-19 pandemic and may be experienced more in countries with a developing scientific system. The impact could be higher for countries that are developing their research environment, are dependent on training their ECRs and conducting experiments abroad through international exchanges programs, which have been stopped due to the pandemic. 
Given these unprecedented times, it has been observed that international scientific organizations, policy-makers, scientific communities, and private stakeholders have strengthened their collaborations in response to the pandemic. We, as ECRs, strongly believe that science diplomacy can make a difference in addressing the challenges (emanated or amplified by the current pandemic) that ECRs would face inside and outside academia. Here we present such challenges, and discuss how the Global Young Academy (GYA), an independent organization of early to mid-career researchers across all disciplines and countries, has provided a platform for ECRs to practice science diplomacy, science advice, and science communication. The former by serving as a bridge between ECRs and governments, the second by hearing the voices of young researchers when enacting policies, and the latter by informing societies about the benefits of scientific research. Motivated by the described examples, we recommend measures for scientists, funding agencies, and international organizations to foster international collaboration in these unparallel times.",TRUE,2021-02-10,2021-02-10,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|Early career researchers|Science Diplomacy|Science Policy,2021-02-10T19:52:02.242180,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-10,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/citation/,f9tsw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hfmwr/,hfmwr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6021a38923238300189d68c6/,6021a38923238300189d68c6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9tsw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f9tsw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f9tsw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

n8yp6,preprints,2021-02-08,"Patient-made Long Covid changed COVID-19 (and the production of science, too)","Background: Significant knowledge about long-term symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection has been produced by patients, which made Long Covid.   
Objective: To document and analyse such knowledge, outline how it changed understanding of COVID-19, and specify ethical and socio-political challenges associated with its development.
Methods: Analysis of publicly available materials on Long Covid by people with Long Covid, largely in English and Italian, and across media and genre.  
Results: Those with Long Covid have made epistemic contributions across multiple media, including: oral, written and visual narratives, testimonies and arguments; quantitative and qualitative research; grey literature, essays, opinion pieces and commentaries; and advocacy and policy interventions. 
Discussion: Patient knowledge contributed to shifting assumptions concerning COVID-19 symptoms and disease pathways; phasing and duration; classification and naming of illness; disease morbidity; and who is affected. Patients’ use of a wide range of media challenged the conventional scientific production of epistemic claims. Many ethical and political challenges lie ahead, including exploitation of patients, their knowledge, and their data.
Conclusions: Long Covid patient activism and research have been instrumental to key epistemic shifts that have changed understandings of COVID-19.

apz4e,preprints,2021-02-07,Social Inequalities in Mobility During and Following the COVID-19 associated lockdown of the Madrid Metropolitan Area in Spain,"Spain has been one of the most affected regions by the COVID-19 worldwide, and Madrid its most affected city. In response to this, the Spanish government enacted a strict lockdown in late March, that was gradually eased until June. We explored differentials in mobility by area-level deprivation in the functional area of Madrid, before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We used cell phone-derived mobility indicators (% of the population leaving their area) from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and a composite measure of deprivation from the Spanish Society of Epidemiology (SEE). We computed changes in mobility with respect to pre-pandemic levels, and explored spatial patterns and associations with deprivation. We found that levels of mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by deprivation once the lockdown was lifted. Given the existence of important socioeconomic differentials in COVID-19 exposure, it is key to ensure that these interventions do not widen existing social inequalities.",TRUE,2021-02-08,2021-02-08,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,commuting|coronavirus|COVID-19|inequalities|mobility|quarantine,2021-02-08T02:03:22.888086,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-08,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/citation/,apz4e,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/60203140339cb600e7cf2985/,60203140339cb600e7cf2985,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/apz4e/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/apz4e/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/apz4e,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

2mzuy,preprints,2021-02-04,Shifting Streets COVID-19 Mobility Data: Findings from a global dataset and a research agenda for transport planning and policy,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought a dramatic shift in demand for spaces for safe, physically distanced walking, bicycling, and outdoor commerce. Cities around the world responded by instituting a variety of policies and programs meant to address this shift, such as carving out roadway space for non-car uses, putting pedestrian walk signals on recall, reducing speed limits, and subsidizing bike share schemes. The extraordinarily rapid pace and global scale of these responses—and the public’s reactions to them—suggest that the transport planning, policy, and engineering professions may be at an inflection point with respect to equitable accommodation of non-car transport modes. In this paper we describe an effort to support potential shifts in practice by documenting and cataloging over a thousand COVID-19-related mobility responses into a publicly available database. We provide detailed guidance on using the database, along with preliminary summaries of key variables in the database. We also put forth a research agenda intended to build understanding about the processes that led to these actions, their implications for future efforts to design and implement pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and ways in which the transport professions might evolve in response to lessons learned during and after the pandemic.",TRUE,2021-02-05,2021-02-05,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,bicycling|COVID-19|infrastructure|practice change|transport planning|walking,2021-02-05T14:41:24.619512,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-02-05,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://pedbikeinfo.org/shiftingstreets,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Tabitha S.

We show changes in behavioral response to social restrictions at three time-points during the pandemic, including across two nationwide lockdowns.  Comparing samples across the four waves, we find evidence of substantial changes in the population’s activities, locations and social interactions, which may be interpreted as direct responses to changes in regulations. One of our main motivations was to compare risk-related behavior across the first and second lockdowns. We find suggestive evidence that the second lockdown (recorded late November 2020) was less strictly adhered to than the first (recorded May-June 2020).  Holding constant gender, age and social grade, the population spent on average 32 more minutes per day in high risk activities in late November 2020 than in first lockdown.

The co-evolutionary interaction between host and parasite results in changes to hosts that are achieved through genetic evolution but involve collective information sharing and behavioral adaptation at the colony level. Common examples are described among ants, bees, and other insects. The US defenses against SARS-CoV-2 were weakened by malformations in the information ecosystem that disrupted the dissemination of information while spreading misinformation and disinformation. Distortions arising from political corruption, and magnified by social media platforms, were especially consequential. I conclude that this failure may ultimately result in a social evolution that weakens US global dominance.

7swqe,preprints,2021-01-28,Locked Down or Locked In? Institutionalized Public Preferences and Pandemic Policy Feedback in 32 Countries,"The Novel Coronavirus Pandemic provides a unique opportunity to test theories of policy feedback in times of national emergency. An important question in this field is whether the discrepancy between public attitudes and emergency rules makes ordinary citizens less likely to comply, which in turn can undermine the goals of that national emergency policies such as the recent lockdown. In this study, we first compare 2016 institutionalized non-Covid related public preferences for government intervention to government actions taken at the outbreak of this pandemic in early March 2020 across 32 middle to high income countries, using aggregated data from the International Social Survey Program and country-level Blavatnik Coronavirus Government Response Tracker data. Then, we use the relative discrepancy between them to predict public behaviors shortly after the initial outbreak in late-March into early April using the Measuring Worldwide COVID-19 Attitudes and Beliefs survey. We find no association between public preferences and government response at the outbreak; however, we find some tentative evidence that the discrepancy between them shows a relationship with public behaviors in the subsequent stage, after adjusting for the local severity of the outbreak and the current level of government intervention. Where the government took much stronger interventions in the outbreak stage relative to public preferences for non-Covid government interventions, the public were more likely to engage in risky social behaviors, such as going out when asked not to, attending social gatherings, or not keeping a safe distance from others. In contrast, where the government took weaker measures, the public were instead more likely to avoid risky social behaviors. Although we cannot conclude whether this means that the enforced measures were more or less effective, our results may suggest that governments took stronger measures in countries where they expected more risky behaviors and that there may be a tradeoff between institutionalized public preferences and the ability to curtail social behaviours.",TRUE,2021-01-28,2021-01-28,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19|government intervention|policy feedback|public behaviors|public opinion.|public policy|public preferences,2021-01-28T17:26:43.331034,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-28,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/hungnguyen167/SPR33-COVID,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/citation/,7swqe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/6012d6a0dd2225029958d442/,6012d6a0dd2225029958d442,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7swqe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7swqe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7swqe,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
c32qh,preprints,2021-01-26,An Analytical Framework for Measuring Inequality in the Public Opinions on Policing –  Assessing the impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic using Twitter Data,"As the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the globe, police forces are charged with new roles as they engage and enforce new policies and laws governing societal behaviours. However, how the police exercise these powers are an important factor in shaping public opinion and confidence concerning their activities across space and time. This research developed an analytical framework for measuring the inequality in the public opinion towards policing efforts during the pandemic using Twitter data. We demonstrate the utility of our framework using 3-months of tweets across 42 police force areas (PFAs) of England and Wales (UK). The results reveal that public opinions on policing is overwhelmingly negative across space and time, and that these opinions have been most exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in three specific PFAs, namely Staffordshire, Thames Valley, and North Wales. We provided the link to the open-source script by which this research could be replicated and adapted to other study areas. This research has the potential to help law enforcement understand the dynamics of public confidence and trust in policing and facilitate action towards improved police services",TRUE,2021-01-27,2021-01-27,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,COVID-19 Pandemic|Inequality|Policing|Sentiment Analysis|Visualization,2021-01-27T19:25:41.742223,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-27,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://github.com/MAnalytics/JGIS_Policing_COVID-19,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/citation/,c32qh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/600fde4c75226b02d9514f08/,600fde4c75226b02d9514f08,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/c32qh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c32qh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c32qh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
c8wk7,preprints,2021-01-24,COVID-19 Is a Persistent Reallocation Shock,"Drawing on data from the firm-level Survey of Business Uncertainty, we present three pieces of evidence that COVID-19 is a persistent reallocation shock. First, rates of excess job and sales reallocation over 24-month periods have risen sharply since the pandemic struck, especially for sales. We compute these rates by aggregating over monthly firm-level observations that look back 12 months and ahead 12 months. Second, as of December 2020, firm-level forecasts of sales revenue growth over the next year imply a continuation of recent changes, not a reversal. Third, COVID-19 shifted relative employment growth trends in favor of industries with a high capacity of employees to work from home, and against those with a low capacity.",TRUE,2021-03-10,2021-01-25,NA,NA,TRUE,FALSE,business expectations|COVID-19|reallocation shock|Survey of Business Uncertainty|working from home,2021-01-25T15:23:42.416070,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2021-01-25,FALSE,NA,no,Researchers interested in the microdata may contact the Survey of Business Uncertainty team at the Atlanta Fed for access.
